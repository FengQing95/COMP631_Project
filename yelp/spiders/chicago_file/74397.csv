Little Goat Diner////Now my dining buddy is a frequent here and he suggested I order the Tonkatsu sandwich which is a breaded pork cutlet with Asian BBQ, Mayo, Cabbage served on White bread. The fact that the sandwich is plated like a tower all upright and pretty had me feeling like Godzilla ready to devour.
