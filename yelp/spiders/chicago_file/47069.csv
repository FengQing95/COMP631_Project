Smoque BBQ////Absolutely a top notch BBQ pit.  The whole package.  Good brisket, sausage, home cut fries, and beans were very well done.  Brisket was sliced from the point and had good bark and flavor and was done just right (the point is always more tender than the flat due to the extra fat in the point). Nice thick slices of brisket with large servings of everything, and smoked with apple and oak by people who know what they are doing.  I'm from out of town, but I'd eat here every time I come back into the Chicago area.  Didn't have a chance to try the ribs, but I will next time.  Prices are not cheap like Texas, but are reasonably priced for the quality food that you get.  Don't miss this if you like real pit BBQ.
