Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I can't say enough about this place. I've had dinner here twice with friends and will be coming back again & again. The staff is friendly and attentive, the sangria is amazing, the menu is broad and diverse and the food is consistently incredible. It's a great casual atmosphere and surprisingly affordable (our group of four had several small plates and a pitcher of mango sangria for just over $100).
