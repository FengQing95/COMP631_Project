Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////one bite into the deep dish and i was SOLD. it was PACKED with fresh, gooey cheese and the toppings were so savory and flavorful! Also, the crust was just thick enough to still feel like a crust but have the texture of really tender bread. and one bite into the crustless pizza, my boyfriend was in HEAVEN! he ate almost the entire pizza by himself! the sausages were molded into crust form, and it was packed tight with cheese, with additional mushroom and peppers on top! it was some legitimate sausage crust, and definitely one of the most innovative pizzas I've ever had! it had about twice the flavor of the deep dish pizza, but that's probably because the sausages are super salty and there is no bread to mediate... INTENSE STUFF!
