The Purple Pig////I've have to say, I've been to both locations and I know some people say the quality of it went down at the new place but that hasn't been my experience at all. All the pictures posted below are from the new location and I was not disappointed at all! My favorite of the night was the crispy pig ears, loved experiencing them in other cuisines besides in Chinese cuisine. So crisp and bursting with flavor. The pork Secreto really surprised me. I expected it to be delicious but it still surpassed my expectations. I've never had such a juicy piece of pork. It was my first experience with that cut of pork and it was an unforgettable one. Will definitely be back, hoping reservations will be available so I don't have to come at odd hours hahah.
