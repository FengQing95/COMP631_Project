Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I'd heard of Wildberry but went for the first time this week. I ordered the "Garden" skillet which was okay, it was kind of bland but I'm thinking it was due to all the veggies inside. However, I love the pancakes and would return for a few more dishes I saw going to other tables. The place was crowded but I reserved via nowait app and walked right in and was seated five minutes later. Our waitress was also attentive and pleasant..I would go back!
