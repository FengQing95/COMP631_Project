Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////IMHO.. this is the best pizza in Chicago.  This is deep dish very filling pizza! The butter crust is great and the toppings are fantastic! I always get "The Lou" spinach and tomato and mushroom and it has never let me down.  The only downside is that you WILL have to wait.. wait for a table and wait for the pizza.  They will take and start your order while you wait for the table, so that does save some time.
