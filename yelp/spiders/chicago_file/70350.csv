Little Goat Diner////She told us about the goat based onion soup, and I being an avid onion soup eater, had to get it. It was one of THE BEST onion soups I have ever had....and I have a personal rule where if there is onion soup on the menu, I absolutely have to try it. It was SO GOOD. Seriously people, try it.
