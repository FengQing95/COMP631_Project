Art Institute of Chicago////First of all, I highly recommend renting the audio tour. There is so much more information the narrative provides over the printed descriptions, the audio will give you a much deeper and lasting appreciation of the art. It allows you to Â focus on specific elements of the piece at the same time the narrator is describing it. At the end of some descriptions, it may give you the option of hearing even more details of the artwork, or sometimes will direct you to another nearby piece to compare.
