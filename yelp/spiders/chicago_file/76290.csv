Little Goat Diner////I had the biscuits and gravy and Bullseye french toast. The biscuits and gravy was exactly what I needed that Tuesday night at 11pm. My mama never made me biscuits and gravy as a kid, and now I'm pissed she didn't. The only thing I would say is that the biscuits were slightly drier than expected.
