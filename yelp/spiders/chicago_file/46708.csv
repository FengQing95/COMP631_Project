Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here recently for brunch with some girl friends and it was phenomenal.  I loved the shrimp and grits as well as the eggs in romesco sauce.  Such a unique brunch experience.  I also love their bloody mary bar!  They have several different things that you can use as your base, including their gazpacho which is soooo good.  Definitely a great spot for more than just dinner!
