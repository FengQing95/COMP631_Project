Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First visit to Chicago and wanted to come here after reading tons of reviews of their deep dish pizza. We went on a Saturday night for dinner. Wait was about 1.5-2 hours which we were okay with waiting since we expected it. We pre-ordered the pizza with the hostess since we wanted to catch the Saturday night fireworks at the Navy Pier. Â Thought it would help cut down the wait time when we are seated.
