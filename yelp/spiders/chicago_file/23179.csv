Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have tried several of the most highly rated deep dish pies and always come back to Lou's. The signature butter crust is fantastic and the quality and quantity of filling keeps me coming back. I had the individual pie this time and the filling seem a bit less generous than the full size versions I had before. It was still great. Â Accompanied by a good beer and I was very happy.
