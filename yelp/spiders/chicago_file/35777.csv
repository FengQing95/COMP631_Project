Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Tried bone marrow for the first time here. I'm sure it's a good version, but I gotta admit, I don't get it. It's just fat! I knew that before I ordered it, and don't know what I was expecting, but...yeah, you just scoop fat onto bread with jam. It tasted ok, but so would anything that well-marbled.
