Smoque BBQ////We are (wannabe) serious BBQ freaks that find just about any reason in the world to throw ribs on the grill. Although my country style ribs, tenderly loved and slow cooked, are the talk of family, friends and neighbors (straight southerners - which is a compliment), I have yet to get all into the "BBQing every part of a cow and pig" . I promise to do so this summer .... No, you are not invited.
