The Purple Pig////The last dish to come out was the Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder ($25). On the menu, it was recommended that this dish be paired with the Babic Reserve ($19 for one glass), thus that was the cup of wine for the afternoon. The meat was very soft and tender; no knife required! Overall a very simple, homey dish. Nothing crazy, no surprises. The mashed potatoes were the thinner variety; although this is not an incorrect way to make the mashed potatoes, I personally prefer them to be a bit thicker. But to each their own.
