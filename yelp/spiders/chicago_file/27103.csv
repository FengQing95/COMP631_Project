Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was in Chicago visiting for a wedding and wanted some deep dish pizza. You can't come to Chicago and not have deep dish pizza. I came across Lou Malnati's Pizzeria on Yelp and I'm glad I did. Everything was amazing. I love the calamari. My favorite was the spinach bread. The spinach bread stole the show. I enjoyed the deep dish pizza too. One piece was plenty!
