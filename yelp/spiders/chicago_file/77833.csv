Little Goat Diner////I personally ordered the okonomiyaki, a Japanese savory pancake with pork belly, topped with an egg and drizzled with sauces similar to what you'd find on takoyaki. Pancake itself was so soft and burst with flavors. I also tried my mom's dish, This Little Piggy Went to China. It reminded me of an Asian inspired eggs benedict. It's a bit on the salty side, but I love salty so fine by me.
