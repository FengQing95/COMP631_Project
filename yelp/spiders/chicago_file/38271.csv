Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Can't say enough about Bavette's.  I don't typically like fancy steakhouses because  I can make a pretty good steak myself, but the sides at this place are worth the $$$$ meal.  I went with the Prime Rib which was cooked right on the screws.  For sides, Truffle Mac, Elote Corn, THICK BACON SLICES (we had as an app not a side), and something else I can't remember.
