Art Institute of Chicago////A perfect experience for a rather chilly day while visiting Chicago.  It was packed w people and there were some areas where it was nearly impossible to appreciate the art because of it but we kept moving and enjoyed as much as we could.  They close at 5 pm on Saturday.  It was $25 for the day and it was with every dime.  Get a map. Get acquainted with what you want to see before you even begin. Time will go fast and you will have some ground to cover as far as space inside the museum. A ton of walk-in so wear comfortable shoes.  I can't even think of a favorite because everything we saw that day was beautiful and amazing and full of stories and history.  Everyone should go to this museum at least once for the experience.
