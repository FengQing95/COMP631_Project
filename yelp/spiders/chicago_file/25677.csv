Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's in particular is plagued by service problems even if their version of the Deep Dish is the least worst I've tasted.  An hour to get an appetizer?  90 minutes to get a pizza or a seat?  Wall to wall tourists?  Check, check, and check.  If you want to lose your sanity come here on a weekend night.  You can have my seat; I won't be using it.
