Smoque BBQ////One word here....brisket!  Best I've EVER HAD! a local recommended this place and I'm sure glad he did! Pretty hot guy walking down the street with a delicious girl how can it not listen to a HOT couple? The atmosphere the people LITERALLY EVERYTHING was perfect. The cornbread is no visioboston market crap, its the real deal as i dip it in bbq beans!  The waitress was even accommodating and it swear important could drink the BBQ sauce plain! I'm would travel forever to eat here and I'll definitely be back
