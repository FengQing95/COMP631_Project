Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My brother and I were in town for a convention as we are always on the lookout for interesting dining experiences our interests were peaked by this place.  Unfortunately we failed to make early reservations but were informed that the bar was full service. The atmosphere was classy but warm and busy but not crammed.  We got in around 630 or 7 and quickly found a spot at the bar.
