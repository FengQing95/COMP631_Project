Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute is not the Metropolitan, the Tate Gallery or the Louvre. That's why I like it It is smaller and intimate but still majestic in its way. You can easily find old friends and discover novelties on each visit. In the heart of the city that became my home it is a safe harbor.
