Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Favorite restaurant in Chicago! Perfect for date nights or a girls night out. Not too expensive and the food and drinks are to die for. Pitchers of red sangria, orders of spicy potatoes, meatballs, goat cheese bread, and the shrimp is what a perfect night entails! You. Must. Go. Here.
