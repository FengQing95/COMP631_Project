The Purple Pig////They've also had their play on ITALIAN BEEF. Now, come on, we're in Chicago. How cool is that? I was very hesitant about it, not gonna lie. Both my boyfriend and brother wanted it, though, so I went along. It was so freaking good! Too bad it was limited. They served some of the juiciest, most tender, most flavor-impactful beef I have ever had. 5/5
