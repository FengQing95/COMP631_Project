Little Goat Diner////There was a short wait for a table by the time we paid our bill (about 10:00 AM). We were satiated and ready to concede our table to the next guests. After all, we wanted to check out the bakery/gift shop area! There was a small caf√© bar, bakery, and gift shop adjoined to the restaurant. We saw jams, spice rubs, shirts, and mugs. We bought two travel mugs ($10 each) and some maple syrup ($25).
