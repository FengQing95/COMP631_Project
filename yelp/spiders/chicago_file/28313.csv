Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I usually don't gravitate towards deep dish, but when in Chicago, you gotta.  All of my Chi-town friends said to go to Lou's, and I see why.  It was great!  The crust, in particular, was buttery and crispy, and maintained its crispiness even on the bottom underneath all the sauce.  Speaking of the sauce, it was fresh, tasty, and the right amount.  I was afraid the cheese would be too much, but the balance between it and the sauce was perfect.  The personal size was a good amount, too, and the bf had one slice leftover from the small size.  So, I wouldn't say I'm converted to Team Deep Dish, but when in Chicago, this is a great choice for a tasty deep dish pizza meal.
