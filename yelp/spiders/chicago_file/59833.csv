Smoque BBQ////The place is packed! Very uncomfortable, just as bad as a school lunch room. you can't even get through all the people to get your drink. The food is ok. The guys that get you a table and clean the tables etc are very nice. Even though they r super busy and can barely move around in there they still try to go above and beyond for you. They'll go get you a to go box etc. So other than the staff the place is not that great. I wouldn't go back.
