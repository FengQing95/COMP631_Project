Smoque BBQ////This place is ridiculously good.  The brisket is the best I've ever had.  Everyone I've ever taken here (about 10 people) have loved this place to death.  I had some family from out of state come in and they loved the place so much that after we had finished eating they ordered another meal to take home!
