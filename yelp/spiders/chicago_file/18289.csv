Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We went on a Thursday night around 8 pm.  The wait was ~40 minutes, so we pre-ordered when we placed our names.  The staff said it takes ~30 minutes for the pizza to bake.  So, we thought, hey that's perfect - we'll pre-order now and when our table is ready, our pizza will be, too.  We were seated in 40 minutes, but our pizza was nowhere in sight.  We waited another 30 minutes or so until our pizza actually arrived.  I guess they were pretty busy.
