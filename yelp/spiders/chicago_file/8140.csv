Art Institute of Chicago////Buy the Chicago City Pass to get VIP entry. Once in the Museum, you will realize that you are in a truly special institution. My better half and I were there for 5 1/2 hours and didn't even scratch the surface. El Greco, Rodin, Van Gogh, Picasso, Pissaro, and many, many more fabulously grace the walls of this gem . I would recommend seeing the Mitsubishi wing of Asian art as well. Artifacts from the Ming dynasty will humble and amaze you. This museum was on par with the Met and the British Museum. You have to see it to believe it.
