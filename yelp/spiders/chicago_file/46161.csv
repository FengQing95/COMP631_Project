Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My experience at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba was completely underwhelming.  The mark was missed with many of our plates.  The cold potato salad had way too much raw garlic in it, bread was stale and difficult to eat.  The paella was uninspired and soggy, lacking the crunchy texture that is typical for paella, perhaps they should call it pilaf.  The hot potato plate totally hit the spot however, and the escargot plate was tasty.
