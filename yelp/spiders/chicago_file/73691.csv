Little Goat Diner////My favorite thing on the menu is the Parathas Burritto. It's pretty filling and you might not have to eat again that day but so darn good. I could use the chili pepper sauce on anything and everything. If you're into waffles you can't miss the Fat Elvis Waffles. Pretty much as decadent as they sound. On the lunch side, the Fish Tostadas are a lighter option but get the Reuben if you want to go big or go home.
