Little Goat Diner////Bottom line: Gourmet-Diner is an interesting concept and I guess I'm a fan.  Thankfully the gourmet price point will keep me from taking up residence in one of the cushy booths.  The menu offers some really wacky/tasty flavors though, so I will definitely be back to try brunch and the cocktails... and to revisit the wing-style burger.  It was soo good.
