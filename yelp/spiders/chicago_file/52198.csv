Smoque BBQ////When I took the first bite of pulled pork sandwich, I was amazed! It was so good. The bread melts in your mouth and the meat is so tender and flavorful. The macaroni was AMAZING. Not a cole slaw fan--wish I would have substituted the macaroni for cole slaw. My date LOVED the brisket as well. He got cornbread which HE LOVED which is to say Â lot because his mother is a baker. The beans were wonderful as well.
