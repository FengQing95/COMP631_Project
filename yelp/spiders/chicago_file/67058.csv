Little Goat Diner////This place should be called, "The little salt shaker". Â I purchased a couple of items from their cafe on separate occasions and boy were they the saltiest things I've ever tasted. I had high hopes for this place. I never Yelp, but I was really floored with how salty the following items were: Goat Chili, Gluten free roll #1 and Gluten free roll #2, I think #2 was a Parmesan roll , but I couldn't taste it.. the cafe salad (to go) was also meh. Le Colombe has better coffee. Over it!
