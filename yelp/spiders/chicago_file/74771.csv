Little Goat Diner////Ordered a bunch of popular menu items including Little Piggy Went to China, Pork Belly and Shrimp, Brussels sprouts and Okonomiyaki. Same problem as the Girl and Goat: food is way too salty. The meat is over-seasoned and you can't really taste its flavor other than an overdose of salt. The shakes here are decent though. The cookies and cream shake was a blast.
