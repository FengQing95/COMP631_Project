Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm not sure what they think they gave me but it wasn't deep dish, unless I have an unfortunate misconception of what deep dish truly is. I was expecting layers upon layers of toppings - think lasagna in a pizza. I mean like T-H-I-C-C. Instead I got a single layer of cheese, sausage, and sauce like any other ordinary, non-deep dish pizza. Maybe it was my fault for ordering the personal size ("Classic Chicago"). We did also order a small Lou's and that one was more like what I was expecting. That one was pretty good, hence the 3 stars. I probably would not come again during prime dining time when the wait was 1+ hour (e.g., Sunday at 5:30pm).
