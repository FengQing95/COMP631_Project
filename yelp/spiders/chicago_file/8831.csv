Art Institute of Chicago////What can I say that all the other folks haven't!? This is a MUST SEE if you're in Chicago. You'll see all the familiar popular works of art up close and personal. The artwork is displayed beautifully. Lots of benches placed throughout to rest. Lots of walking - keep that in mind when you slip into your footwear that day!
