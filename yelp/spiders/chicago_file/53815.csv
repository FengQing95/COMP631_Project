Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Been here a couple times mainly for the good vibes and the sangria + tapas combination (their pomogranate sangria is so refreshing!) Make sure to ask your servers about the portion for each dish, since sometimes 3-4 can be filling for one person, but sometimes 2 is enough. Their paella, short ribs, and spicy potatoes are my favorite dinner dishes, and most items from the brunch menus are delicious. Dessert-wise; the butterscotch custard probably stands out the most. The chocolate truffle cake is also good, but nothing special about it, and the pomegranate sorbet was waaay too sour. However, it's a great place to hang out and have good conversations over a wide variety of dishes and sangria (plus the good service) so I'll be back again!
