Little Goat Diner////The service was great! The orange juice and cinnamon buns are phenomenal and freshly made. The atmosphere is awesome with cool jams playing in the background. It's in the up and coming area of the West Loop in Chicago. It is owned by a top chef winner. The menu is humorously put together.
