Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////A fun place to go and have deep dish Chicago style pizza with lots of baseball memorabilia on the walls- not just Sox's & Cubs. The Lou and Classic pies are nice as we say in Jersey. The fried calamari is good, not too much oil and tastes fresh. Some say you need to try the thin crust pies. I would agree, but if you are not frequenting Chicago then you have to go with the deep dish.
