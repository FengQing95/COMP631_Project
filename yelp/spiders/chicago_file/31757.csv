Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I chose to visit Malnati's for the history and I had only heard rave reviews prior to dining here myself. It's a larger chain but I would say that you don't feel that way upon entering. Very reminiscent of any nicely decorated and cozy local Italian eatery. At this particular venue, I received great service, and everything was very clean. Â
