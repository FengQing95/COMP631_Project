Smoque BBQ////What can i say that anybody else has not said? Well just a couple suggestions. Choose take out instead of dining in because that place is tiny and you will be elbow to elbow with everybody. I should have called in my order but the line wasn't that long and it still took 45 min to place an order. This was my 1st bbq restaurant experience and it did not disappoint. Tried brisket for the 1st time in my life and it was yummy, it also had a really good smokey flavor. The mac & cheese was the best i've ever had. Baked beans were good, I just wasn't a fan of the onions in them. My bbq quest has just started!
