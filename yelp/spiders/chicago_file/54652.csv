Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////So tonight I went to dinner for the first time at this establishment. I was with my work company event. All was well untill I was headed to my seat. There was a two inch nail hanging out of wall in private room we were in back of room. First it took forever to get management to get to me. My husband who was quick on it put an icecube on it immediately thank goodness as my upper arm was throbbing. Arthur finally came with a report and asked me to answer some questions. I was not humored by his asking...so I do not need to call a paramedic. Im in customer service and have had to fill out these reports before. After he left he came back with gift cards to Â shut me up. The buss boy was more apologetic then Arthur was he also banged the nail back into the wall, Arthur asked to see my arm. It was dark and hard for me to pull my sleeve down. Honestly it was embarrassing like I was faking it. I will definitely have a bigger bruise tomorrow as it is raised tonight. Definitely didn't get to experience my dinner after this. Customer service is so important! Not sure even with my gift card I will return. Get it together owner/management
