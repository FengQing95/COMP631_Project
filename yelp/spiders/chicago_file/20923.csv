Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Yes, yes, and yes.  I was visiting Chicago for a wedding, and went to Lou Malnati's for an early lunch based on the bride and groom's recommendation.  We got there on Saturday at 11:10 AM and were seated immediately.  (Side note: I am so glad we didn't wait until noon because the place was full by then.  We left just before 1 PM and there was a wait at the door.)
