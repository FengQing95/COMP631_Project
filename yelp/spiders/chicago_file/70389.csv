Little Goat Diner////The food was really good. However, the service sucks. Pretty typical of the area to be overpriced, and lack the fine dining service. Even the waiters know how bad their wait staff is, one of the other waiters said to our waitress, "you're such a bad waiter." Presumably he was kidding, but still this should paint you picture of the service.
