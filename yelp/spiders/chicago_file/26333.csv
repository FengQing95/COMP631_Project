Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Depends what kindve pizza you like but if you like true thick Chicago deep dish, this iconic stronghold is your place. These boys are thicker than the Himalayan mountains. You could easily split a pie amongst a group of 4/5 hungry ravenous gents. I honestly have no clue about anything else on the menu.
