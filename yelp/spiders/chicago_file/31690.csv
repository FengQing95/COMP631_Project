Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When in Chicago, first-timers want to try the famous Chicago deep dish pizza and Italian beef sandwich.  We stopped by Lou Malnati's and the check-in process is efficient.  They take your phone number to text you when a table is ready, you go in and order your pizza in advance, and the wait time was about 30 minutes.
