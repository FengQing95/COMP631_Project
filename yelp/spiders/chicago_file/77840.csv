Little Goat Diner////The service was delightful with our server offering wine suggestions and joking with our party. Each of my friends dishes were just as flavorful and some had a more savory twist. If you want to eat great food and enjoy all the little goat decals then this is your place. The wide windows will give you lots of Vitamin D. You can't go wrong!
