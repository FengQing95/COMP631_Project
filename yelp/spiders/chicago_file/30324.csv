Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We first started off appetizers: Malnati salad, mozzarella stick, buffalo wings, and calamari. Malnati salad was very delicious! It wasn't too heavy, so I could eat it all. Salad dressing was perfectly matches to the salad. Loved it. Â Mozzarella stick was okay. Nothing special. I didn't eat wings or calamari.
