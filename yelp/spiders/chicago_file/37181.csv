Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////One of the best steaks I've had in all of Chicago, amazing apps and sides, and very friendly staff. Reservations are hard to get, so we had a book 5 weeks in advance but well worth the wait! The garlic shrimp app was fantastic, and the truffle mac and charred broccoli were delightful with a very tender juicy steak. We came to celebrate our engagement and they even treated us to a ice cream! Highly highly recommend
