Little Goat Diner////Loved it.  My sister and I went here for a Wednesday morning brunch.  There were SO many options on the menu that sounded good.  We decided to share a Cinnamon Roll, the French Toast with Chicken, and the chicken taco special.  First of all, the cinnamon roll was one of the best I've ever had.  They not only nailed the goey-ness, but also nailed the frosting! The French toast was good.  It was a unique dish and I love trying new things.  And the chicken tacos had a tasty slaw and fresh Guac.  The tortillas were also very fresh.  My sister lived her latte- she said it was especially frothy.  I had a nice Hibiscus tea.  May have to come back again some day when I'm in the area again!
