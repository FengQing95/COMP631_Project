The Purple Pig////This is the #1 recommended must go to restaurant every time I mention to someone from my hometown that I'm going to Chicago. For the past three recent trips, I've been wanting to make my way here to see what is all the hype about and Â this time, I finally got to find out. Let me tell you, The Purple Pig has lived up to that hype and so much more. We came with great expectations and excited to say that we left being so satisfied that I am now one of those people that can't stop and won't stop recommending the next visitors to the Windy City to come here. Even on a Friday night, packed out, they made sure we were kept 6 ft. distanced away from other parties so that is very much appreciated in a time like this. My favorites were just about everything we ordered, can't think of one thing we did not like... From the crispy duck, to the melt in your mouth pork belly, tasty little charcuterie board, and the unforgettable buttery bone marrow, it was all so delicious! Possibly some of the best dishes I've ever had.
