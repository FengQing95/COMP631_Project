Smoque BBQ////So let me offer an explanation to your fair question about our brisket price. You are correct that in 2013 and into much of 2014, our price for a pound of brisket was 16.95. Unfortunately, raw meat prices don't necessarily move in step with inflation.  In 2014, the price of raw brisket jumped an unprecedented 60% over the previous year.  It did start dropping in 2015 but has never gotten close to pre-2014 levels.  And even as brisket prices were starting to drop a bit in 2015, Chicago's minimum wage hike went into effect, increasing from $8.25 to where it stands today at $11. That's a 33% increase (and it's going up to $12 this July).  While we have historically paid our staff well above minimum wage, the increased minimum has caused upward pressure on wage expectation of high-quality people.  While $11 was once an attractive rate--well above the minimum wage-- it no longer is.  The result is that it costs considerably more to maintain a high-quality staff than it did in 2014.  To be clear, we don't begrudge our hard-working staff the increases. They work extremely hard and they deserve it.  But the higher labor costs, combined with increased food costs, truly left us no choice but to raise prices.
