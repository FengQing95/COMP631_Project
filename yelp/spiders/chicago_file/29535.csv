Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We shared the Lou's small pizza and oh my gosh was it the best pizza I have ever eaten. It had spinach, onions, garlic, mushrooms, and we added sausage. And Of course we got it with the butter crust, because well, why not? After we ordered the server asked if we wanted an appetizer or salad because the pizza would take 45 minutes. We decided against a starter and I was regretting it about 20 minutes into the wait, but once the food came out I was glad we had decided against it! Deep dish pizza is SO filling!
