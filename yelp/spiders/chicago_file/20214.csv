Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I can't seem to survive without a weekly deep dish pep delivered to my apartment.  Of course I will visit the restaurant any time I have friends or family in town, love seeing the look on all their faces when they try the best pizza they've probably ever had in their life.  Great outdoor patio to enjoy a few beers while waiting for the pizza.  Super friendly wait staff and delivery staff.
