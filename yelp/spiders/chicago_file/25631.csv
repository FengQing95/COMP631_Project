Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered the gluten free pizza with sausage and onion. I must say the sausage was great! The gluten-free crust was mediocre, which most gluten-free people are used to. My waitress would go MIA for 30 mins at a time, I would get no refill. I would have to stop other servers to get my more napkins, drink, etc. It wasn't until I saw my waitress walking back from McDonald's was when I was furious. I had to wait over 45 mins after eating to get a check. Let me you remind you that this place was not busy at all. It was during an off time in between dinner and lunch. Then the waitress came by and said that she would be in a meeting while we were receiving our pizza. Why would a restaurant schedule a staff meeting during operation hours?? I'm not sure how efficient this restaurant would be when busy if it wasn't efficient when it was empty.
