Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I really enjoyed most of what I ate at Bavettes.  I started with the duck and goat cheese terrine and it was outstanding. I'm not one that is heavy-handed with sauces, but the ones here are not to be missed. This appetizer comes with an apricot mustard that adds a whole different level of complexity to the dish.
