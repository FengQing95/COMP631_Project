The Purple Pig////Another absolutely amazing dish! Tell tale sign...this was something special; it was served with a spoon! NO KNIFE!!! My thoughts at the time: A piece of Pork Shoulder on the Bone served with a SPOON?! Hmmm...are they nuts?! Where is my KNIFE?! Did they make a mistake? Nope. Nope. Nope. They got it right! The meat is so tender, it just falls of the bone...no knife required! The Pork was just PERFECT! Tender, Juicy, full of flavor, complemented brilliantly with the Lentils & Mashed Potatoes. I could find no fault...just wish there was more. #LifeOfAFatty
