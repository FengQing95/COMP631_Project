Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Out of the three housemade dips, roasted garlic and giardiniera-topped hummus were my favorite. The artichoke dip was just okay. The deep dish pizza was AMAZING!!!! The crust was nice and crispy and the cheese was oozing out. Yummm.... I wished it didn't take so long to make because I was already kind of full after the dips and pizza chips by the time it arrived. :(
