Smoque BBQ////Transit options: This is an intermodal venue. There are many ways to get here. I'll change it up this time by telling you something significant if you decide to drive here. Because Smoque is so close to the Union Pacific Northwest line, the Irving Park Blue Line "L" station, and the Kennedy Expressway; but is in a residential neighborhood; there are parking restrictions on Grace St. [one way westbound], and Keystone Ave. [one way northbound] Smoque's own parking lot is only six spaces. You want to approach Smoque from the northwest; either on Irving Park Rd., or off the Kennedy at Keeler. The avenue you want to wind up on is _Avondale Ave._ It is the diagonal street on the south side of the U.P. railroad tracks. _It is one way southeastbound._ After 8:00 am, there are no parking restrictions on Avondale. Cram your vehicle into any spot you can find. Then, you'll face a one-to-two block walk. Lest you perceive I am making a fuss about this; Smoque's own pamphlet illustrates the parking situation.
