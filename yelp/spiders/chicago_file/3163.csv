The Purple Pig////Sat at the bar because of the wait for lunch on a Thursday. Started with a great Bloody Mary for me and a North Coast saison for my fianc√©e. First dish was the homemade Nduja which is a yummy spreadable salami into a cheesy bread. Sweet, salty with a bit of sour pickled veggies...yum.
