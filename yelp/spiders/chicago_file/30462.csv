Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza here was good but not amazing. We ordered a small (serves 2) "Lou" which has a spinach mix, mushrooms and sliced roma tomatoes on it. Â It was very fresh (it takes a while to make) and filling. I am so glad I got it because it hit the spot but it's definitely not good enough to pay as much as it is ($18.25). We got there in the morning literally right when they opened (there's no shame in eating pizza for breakfast!) but we really wanted to avoid the line. I think overall it's good pizza but it gets a lot more hype than necessary. Try it once and then move on.
