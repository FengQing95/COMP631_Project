Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Absolutely delicious. Me and my girlfriend were visiting from Texas, and wanted a nice restaurant for "Date night in Chicago" I was supposed to plan the night. I came across this restaurant on a google search. Seemed everyone was raving. I called 4 days prior to the day we needed reservations, they only had 10:30p or later on a Friday night. But the lady was nice enough to tell me they also do walk ins, so we decided to show up at 8, the hostess told us it was about an hour wait, wouldn't you know at 9:08, she came and found us in the bar area to get is to our table. Luckily we got a table that seats 4, so we had room for our main course and sides. We could see tables around having to make adjustments and maneuver the plates and beverage glassware due to the table being too small for the 2 seats. So now the food and service. All was amazing! As mentioned we're from Texas and my gf loves Elote corn, the corn here is really good she enjoyed it, it's very creamy and flavorful. I had the ribeye, she had the lamb chops, we had elote corn and mac and cheese. The food was super great. Service was even better by Julio.
