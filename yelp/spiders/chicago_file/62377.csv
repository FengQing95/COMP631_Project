Smoque BBQ////Back to the rules of this place...see the picture I posted here. Kind of says it all.Since they know they are the real deal when it comes to Ribs and Brisket, guess they can get away with an attitude. Â  They have the best ribs and brisket around Chicago, but if you want a better dining experience and the same good ribs and brisket, just go to Que in LaGrange...it is the same..without the BS.
