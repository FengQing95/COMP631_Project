Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Every item I have eaten here has been spot-on. They have the best starter bread I've every had. They somehow manage to keep the butter at literally 1 degree below its melting point, and it goes liquid the second it touches the bread. The iceberg wedge is worth it for the bacon alone, and the goat cheese appetizer is great for sharing. The steaks, from the hanger up to the regular and bone-in ribeyes, have been fantastic and perfectly cooked. The homestyle entrees are excellent, particularly the meatloaf. I've not tried any of the seafood dishes because...Chicago. As for sides, everyone has good reason to rave about the corn, and the creamed spinach and loaded potato are deserving of equal praise.
