Little Goat Diner////Another post-call breakfast and another happy belly after a long night in the hospital.  Went for the okonomiyaki (somehow a savory, fishy breakfast made sense for me because it still felt like dinner having barely slept the night before) -- really super tasty and can recommend (although truth be told I have been wanting to try this dish somewhere and this is my first taste -- I'll be on the look for other restaurants making it because it was super tasty).  My friend has spicy apple pancakes (my wife has tried this before) and they lived up to the bill again -- love that vanilla malt butter.  The service is still top notch, super present, pleasant & kind.  I'll keep going back.
