Little Goat Diner////The patty melt had amazing crunch that only good bread can give, a real tasting patty not frozen or overly seasoned to mask sub quality meat.  Th fries were good but a little thin for my liking, fresh cut thicker potatoes would have sent them to the stratosphere.  The tuna melt was not your mama's tuna melt but it was the best my husband had ever tasted.
