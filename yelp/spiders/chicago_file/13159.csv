Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Have a slice here and you can see why Chicago is known for their deep dish pizza. Yum! Being from the West Coast, nothing in California comes close. Here, you order sausage on your pizza, you get little specs of sausage meat balls here and there, order at Lou Mainati's, you get a layer of sausage on your pizza! I'm itching to go back :D
