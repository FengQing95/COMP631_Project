The Purple Pig////The food here is okay, but to be honest not sure why the ratings are so high. We are visiting and came here last night with a couple of friends. First off, getting on the waitlist is sort of confusing. You basically can't call to get on the waitlist but they don't tell you that outright. So if you want to walk in your best bet is to go in person to put your name down. Wish they could be more clear about this. I called twice to check on wait times and they were also unclear about how wait times would be like, plus the second person who picked up was sort of rude and unhelpful. Luckily we came around 8 and were seated after about 15 minutes.
