Little Goat Diner////Cons: 20 minute tempura.  Fries came out McDonald's cold - you know when they're trying to sell really cold fries; it's on the fry guy.  Bahn Mi needed a whole lotta acid; it was really heavy and on the whole good but, still needed a little help.  The soup while tasty was the consistency of gravy.
