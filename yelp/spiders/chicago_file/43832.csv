Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love this place! I recommend going with a group so you can order it up and share! Anytime I go there I need to order the following: sangria, olives, stuffed mushrooms, spicy potatoes with tomato alioli, manchego cheese, and crab & shrimp dip. I know, it sounds like a lot! But that's just these are must-haves! We always wind up ordering a couple more plates if there's a group of 4 or more.
