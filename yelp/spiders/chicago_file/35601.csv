Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Let's start with the standout item. It's the steak. I got the bone in dry aged ribeye: a 22oz steak, absolutely massive, topped with sauce bearnaise. I opted to have it rare. It was incredible. Utterly divine. Perfectly prepared, superbly tender, an explosion of flavor that blew me away on every bite.
