Smoque BBQ////The facts. St.Louis Ribs. Bomb diggidy. Big ol' smoke ring (the pink lining under the skin for newbies). They remove the translucent skin underneath the rib, hate when places don't do that. Hugs the bone gently, doesn't fall off the bone (that's a no-no, again for you newbs). Sliced brisket, that's one BIG OHHH YEAHHH! Masterfully cooked with and almost pillowy texture. No sauce needed. Pulled pork's good, but I'd prefer a vinegar based sauce for PP (can't all get what we want though).
