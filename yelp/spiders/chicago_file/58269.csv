Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ordered the pinxtos platter, red sangria, and paella mixtas. We really liked the nduja sausage & ricotta crostini on the platter. Red sangria had great fruity flavors and the paella was very savory. Waitress was nice and food came out fast. This is a good place to come unwind with friends.
