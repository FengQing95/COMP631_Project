Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As for the rest of the restaurant, it's a much better alternative to Uno and Due.  I wouldn't go to Giordano's even if there was no line (and they paid me to eat it).  Lou's is much better pizza.  Be sure to order your pie while you wait for a more efficient and satisfying experience.  I have also discovered that you can order your pie well-done, which takes care of the sogginess that can occur in larger pies (historically I've just kept to mediums).
