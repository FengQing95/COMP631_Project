Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We decided on the Malnati's Chicago Classic - lean sausage, some extra cheese, and vine-ripened tomato sauce on their famous Buttercrust. It was quite good, but I wish the sausage had been a bit spicier.  And honestly, I was so hungry that taste was really only a secondary concern.
