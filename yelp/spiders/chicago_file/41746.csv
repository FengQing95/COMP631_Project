Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Food and sangria was delish. Highly recommend this place if you are looking for good tapas. We did have a slight seating issue. They sat us in this back room that was really cold, but as soon as we asked to be moved, they moved us no problem. So I really appreciated how accommodating they were.
