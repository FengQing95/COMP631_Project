Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////A Chicago landmark, Lou Malnati's is a destination stop for pizza lovers! Their deep-dish pizza has reached iconic status and I couldn't wait to try it! Because of COVID, it was easy to get a seat. Ordered the bbq wings and the Malnati Classic deep dish pizza which was sausage, cheese, tomato sauce over their famous "butter crust". Added pepperoni for good measure. Was disappointed that meatballs was not a topping option. Pizza did not disappoint with thick layers of cheese and sausage and topped with a really nice marinara. The butter crust was good but wasn't necessarily a differentiator for me. Really enjoyed the pizza, wings were average. While Malnati's deep dish was really good, it didn't quite have the wow factor I was expecting. That being said, food was delicious and the service was solid.
