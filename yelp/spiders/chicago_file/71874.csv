Little Goat Diner////If you do have time for Brunch lucky you!! Put your name on the list and watch the magic unfold.  The decor is amazing.  Like all of Stephanie's restaurants attention to detail is the last thing to go by the wayside.  From the floors to the breakfast bar, everything makes you feel like happy.  For food whatever you do make sure you have the home fries! MMMM so good! The menu is always changing but the potatoes and milkshakes stay consistent and thats really all you need to know.
