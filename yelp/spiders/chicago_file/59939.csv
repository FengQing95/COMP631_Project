Smoque BBQ////With my "no ethnic food, please" sister in town for the night, I decided to try Smoque for the good ol'fashioned barbeque it's so widely acclaimed for. I can assure you, Smoque lived up to its reputation as a no-frills, damn good barbeque joint. My sister and I both had the Pulled Pork sandwich with a side of Mac & Cheese. The sandwich was fantastic, tangy and juicy, and the mac & cheese was some of the best "restaurant-made" I've ever had. Call me crazy, but I'm pretty partial to Kraft's Blue Box mac & cheese and usually steer clear of anything else. But this, this was something different.
