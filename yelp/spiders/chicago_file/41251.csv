Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been here probably close to ten times. I've almost had everything on the menu and I've loved almost every single one of them.  If it has a food you like in it, you will love the dish. If you like potatoes- any of them on the menu are fantastic. If you like bacon, you will just die for the bacon wrapped dates. If you like Caesar salad, theirs is phenomenal. The shorts ribs are amazing and hanging beef is well worth the price.  The mushrooms are delicious. And the sangria is perfect. So much yumminess.
