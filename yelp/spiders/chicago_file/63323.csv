Smoque BBQ////Food is excellent as ever but what happened to the friendly host?  Went there yesterday and was treated rudely.  My daughter was in line to order and I grabbed a table since I cannot stand for extended  length of time.  His royal host asked me to move.  I explained, grudginly he let me stay.  By the way, the place was busy but not super crowded, plenty of empty tables.  After eating my daughter went to get the car.  I sat down outside on a chair and again, his hostness made me move to seat some people, when the whole outside was practically unoccupied.
