Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It was well worth the 1 1/2 house wait. We were in town on vacation with the kids and we walked form our hotel down to Lou's. It was a nice Summer night so we hung out outside and waited for our table. The pizza is all that's it promised to be and it was a good thing we walked there cause we were so stuffed we needed the walk back you our hotel.
