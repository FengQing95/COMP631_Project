Art Institute of Chicago////Beautiful museum. You can have several Ferris Bueller moments here if you'd like. Â We had limited time so saw the highlights including American Gothic, Cassatt's The Child's Bath, Toulouse-Lautrec's Moulin Rouge, Haystacks & Water Lilies by Monet, Cezanne's Basket of Apples, pieces by Jackson Pollock, Van Gogh and Seurat's A Sunday on La Grande Jatte. Very lovely place.
