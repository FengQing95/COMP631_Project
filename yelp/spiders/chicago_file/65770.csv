Smoque BBQ////I am officially addicted. I love the St. Louis ribs with no bbq sauce to ruin it. I also like their vinegar based coleslaw. The employees are kind and friendly and the gentlemen working there hold the door open for you with a smile which is really nice and leaves me with a happy feeling. I love Smoque BBQ!
