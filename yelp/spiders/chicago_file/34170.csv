Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We loved the service, the atmosphere, and we especially loved the food and drink.  We started with some cocktails.  I had the champagne cocktail which was lovely.  My friends had a horse neck and the gin & champagne cocktail which was the best of the 3.  We started with the baked goat cheese which was heavenly.  There is an herb in it that makes it totally unique.  We were guessing tarragon?  Then we were joking with the waiter and they mentioned that I don't eat most meats and he offered to bring me the vegetarian menu.  This was a first for me!  I had to check it out even though I was pretty sure I was getting the fried chicken based on these Yelp reviews.  It was nice to see that they had a lot of the same dishes but without meat and for a lesser price.  Regardless I got the chicken and was super pleased that I did.  It maybe the best fried chicken that I've ever had.  I think they double dip it :-) I don't really care for eating meat off of the bone so I was happy to have a side of broccoli with it.  It was just steamed broccoli but wow was it good!  Just perfectly cooked, with a little lemon.  Very nice.  Then we discovered that they have some Pappy and being a bourbon fanatic we had to try the 10 year in a manhattan for dessert....along with the best chocolate cream pie in the city.  That was a very happy moment.  We were sad to leave!
