Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Always a hit at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! The food is delicious, the mood is great for a date night or a dinner party, sangria is a must! The boyfriend and I came in to kick off Chicago Restaurant Week and we were not disappointed! Food was amazing and server was great, just a little rocky on the paying. I tried to apply my birthday points for the Lettuce Entertain You reward I had but for some reason it was not put in which I noticed after signing my receipt. I tried to find the waitress but she wasn't around so we decided to leave and just use them elsewhere.
