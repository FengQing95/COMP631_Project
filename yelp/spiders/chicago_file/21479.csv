Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I came to Lou's for a first taste of deep dish pizza and was very happy with my meal! While it definitely seemed like a tourist spot, I think that it was good food for a food price. The service was excellent, and I believe that the non-alcoholic drinks had free refills. As an added bonus, it was a beautiful walk over the river from the Loop.
