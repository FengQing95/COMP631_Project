Art Institute of Chicago////This museum is anything but lacking! They just opened up a beautifully architected modern wing, a nice collection of renaissance and contemporary art. Various other ancient and ethnic arts, even a miniature room exhibit! This place will take AT LEAST 5 hours to walk through completely! Multiple gift shops too. SAIC, you are so lucky to have such a wonderful museum!
