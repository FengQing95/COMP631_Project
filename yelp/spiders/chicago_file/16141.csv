Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The atmosphere here is great.  It doesn't feel like some kind of patronizing, touristy, "oh look how big our pizzas are!" pizza place.  It is very down to earth, with a bustle of people eating delicious food.  The draught beer selection is pretty good too, and even appetizers are good!  The calamari was average, but the bruschetta was actually really good.
