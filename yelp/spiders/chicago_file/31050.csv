Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Walking distance from my hotel, The Gwen. healthy walk about 20 minutes but worth it. I knew this location woud be crazy - perfect storm of the National Restaurant Show in town, a Friday night and the BEST pizza, hands down. Four deep at the bar. Â I began stalking the people at the bar so i could snag a seat. Ordered my thin crust pizza and a cold Corona as soon as the bartender could see me (smiling).
