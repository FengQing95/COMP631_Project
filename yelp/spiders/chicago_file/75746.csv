Little Goat Diner////I've heard so many things about this place that I had to go try it out! Definitely make a reservation here cuz it can get pretty crowded. The vibe of the restaurant is very 1960s - vinyl booths, steel tables, bright and colorful, vibrant images on the walls. The menu is pretty typical diner food with some interesting ethnic twists that I wasn't sure how to feel about. I ordered their popular bullseye French toast, and my friends ordered the chili and the American burger, as well as the One Twisted Sundae. Breakfast is available all day which is amazing! The French toast was a very interesting blend of savory and sweet and it was really filling! The sundae was great and I heard that the burger was very solid. Overall loved the vibe of the restaurant and the food, would definitely come back!
