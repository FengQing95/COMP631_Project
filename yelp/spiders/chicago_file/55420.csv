Smoque BBQ////While it can't be said that the food at Smoque can truly compare to the stuff you can find in, say, Kansas City, it's more than good enough to satisfy both connoisseurs and newcomers to BBQ, and you'll find a little bit of everything on the menu. How about a Texas style sliced brisket sandwich with a side of BBQ Beans? Or a slab of St. Louis style ribs with fresh cut french fries and mac and cheese? Everything, whether it was an entree or a side, was consistently fabulous each time I went. Unless you're not into smoky tasting food or meat in general, there's really nothing to complain about.
