The Purple Pig////So really this is a 4.5 but I have to give them 5 stars as it's Jeremy C's fave place in the city. Â Food here has been consistently excellent, we often recommend this place for out of town guests, partly because of the excellent location. It's on Michigan Ave, not far from the Chicago River, and you can walk to Millenium park if you're up for it.
