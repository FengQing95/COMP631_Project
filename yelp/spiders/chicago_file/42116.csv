Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I can't help myself but to keep going back here.  It is a great environment, I love their tapas.  I tend to order the warm ones and I love their Paella ... especially the seafood one!  One of the last times I was here, I ordered the butterscotch mini dessert because the waiter recommeded it and it was to die for.  I would have never ordered it unless he would have recommended it.  They also have a ton of fun events.  I have done a wine tasting there.  Recently I took a Paella cooking class and it was more like a tasting while they showed us how to make Paella.  I really enjoyed the event but what I learned it that I will let them fix me the Paella.  :)  They have tons of other events and a make your own Bloody Mary bar I am going to have to try!
