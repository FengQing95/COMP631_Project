Smoque BBQ////Really good food.  We brought some friends from Germany recently, and they loved the barbecue, as did we.  The meat was fantastic, especially the brisket and pulled pork.  This being my first time, I didn't know it was BYOB, so be advised if you're expecting a bar.  They're organized such that you order at the counter and then get your table - this is probably the best way to get everyone through most efficiently.  DELICIOUS.
