Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Definitely the place to be for tapas and paella! Everything here is delicious but my favorite thing is the olives and paella. They have definitely imported the best olives and perfected the art of paella. Also, don't forget to add their delicious sangrias to complete your Spanish fiesta.
