Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ran into an issue with the cookie pizza we ordered after dinner, and we had to wait over 30 minutes, but they finally brought it out to us, comped us for it, and apologized profusely.  It was such a minor mistake, that things like this happen.  The staff was super friendly here, and I would visit this particular location in the future again!  If you haven't had Lou Malnati's pizza...you have to try them.  Its amazing.
