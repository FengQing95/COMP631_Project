Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Very popular breakfast place. My friends and I had about a 30 minute wait before we could be seated which I didn't mind. It's family friendly, but very packed. They have great breakfast/brunch options on the menu. We tried several items and it was all very pleasing. Loved the waffles. The staff is also friendly and accommodating. Our waitress gave us a good breakfast option to get more bang for our buck which we sincerely appreciated. Great place!
