The Purple Pig////Came to chicago to feast because this is a city filled to the brim with good restaurants. Of course purple pig was on that list and I had to see if the hype was worth it. We ended up getting delivery since we didn't have time to go in person. I'm sure food would've been much more palatable in person; therefore, take this review with a grain of salt.
