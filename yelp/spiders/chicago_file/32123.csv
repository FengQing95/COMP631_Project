Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Tried to order delivery through door dash. Door dash accepts the order, but then the restaurant calls to say though they're on door dash they don't use door dash drivers, and their drivers are unwilling to deliver an order at 3p bc of a parade at 5:30. This makes no sense. Now I'm left w no dinner and a hassle to try to cancel door dash. Ridiculous experience. Order from Genos East instead.
