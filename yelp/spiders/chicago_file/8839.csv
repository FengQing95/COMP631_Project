Art Institute of Chicago////From Picasso and Monet to Warhol and Rothko. They are all here. Seurat, Munch, Van Gogh, Kandinsky, Cassat. Them too. Everyone is here! It's got such a wide style of offerings. It really has every kind of art you've ever wanted to look at. It had art that was a replica of a tree. It had art made out of candy. There was art from lights. Art that inspired. Art that made me sad. And art that confused me. I ended up spending about four hours in there and really only left because my ankle was acting up. rude ankle.
