Little Goat Diner////While I'd be the first to say the Girl and the Goat fully lives up to the hype, I'm not as big a fan as this place. With that said, this is a very well run place that puts out interesting takes on classic diner food. The ambiance is excellent, the attached bakery is delightful, the pricing is reasonable, the service effortless, and the food decent. With that said and the place is crazy packed, as I ate their odd take on eggs benedict I wondered about all the other diners in Chicago which probably were empty and much more deserving of our patronage. I dunno - classic diner food is classic since well, its classic. I'm not sure I need kimchi on my eggs benedict.
