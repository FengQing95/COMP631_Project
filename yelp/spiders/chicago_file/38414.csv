Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago right now. Everything from the service to decor to menu is top notch. I'm a huge fan of the 20s inspired ambiance, so that's a huge plus for me. It's a very intimate setting, perfect for a date. I ordered the pork chop, which practically melted in my mouth with every bite. My boyfriend ordered the ribeye, which was also amazing. He ordered it with the bone marrow, which I wasn't a huge fan of, but I'm generally not a fan of bone marrow. The service was excellent, food came within minutes, and the experience was overall excellent. I cannot wait to go back.
