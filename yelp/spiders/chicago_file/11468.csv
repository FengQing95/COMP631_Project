Art Institute of Chicago////There is just huge variety of art from eclectic sources. Asian, European, Native American, African, American, Classical, Modern, you name it, this place is enormous. I got the audio tour (extra $7 dollars) but it was worth it, it gave a nice background to the pieces that had something recorded for the audio tour, which is to say, all the main pieces at least. Even though I did spend the good part of a day here there was a recommended "1 hour" route that takes you through to see the 10 most famous pieces that they have in their collection. Nice, but I would really recommend you allocate more time to see more of the treasures this place has to offer. It'll be a quiet serene day of walking and admiration. Perfect in my book. Chicago is lucky to have a place like this.
