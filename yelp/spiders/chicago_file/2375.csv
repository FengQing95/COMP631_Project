The Purple Pig////The Purple Pig is amazing! We went for lunch right before we had to fly back to Atlanta. It's in the heart of the city, or so it seems. Lots of expensive department stores and big historical modernized buildings surround the restaurant. The menu was perfect for Justin and me because we love cheese and charcuterie. We tried a couple different cheeses and a sausage pate. Yum. Also we tried a pork shoulder which was really amazing. Service was perfect. Lunch crowd gets busy really quickly. We got there at 10:30 AM and we couldn't enter until 11:05 AM but we were immediately seated.
