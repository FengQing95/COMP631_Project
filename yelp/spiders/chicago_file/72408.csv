Little Goat Diner////We held our wedding ceremony and reception at Little Goat on the second floor private dining/outdoor terrace. It was absolutely perfect and everything that we had envisioned. We worked with Tiffany for about a year and she was so extremely kind, thoughtful, knowledgeable, and helpful throughout the entire process. Working out all of the little details was a breeze and ultimately we knew everything was going to be taken care of so we could enjoy ourselves on our day. Little Goat also provided all of the food and cakes for our wedding and are guests are still raving about how good everything was! I would highly recommend Little Goat for an intimate wedding celebration (or brunch, or lunch, or dinner, or just the bakery...)!!
