Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We stopped by one night unexpectedly and were unable to get a table. I made a reservation for my now fianc√©'s as a stop for her birthday celebration, and we were successful. We had the steak tartare and steak frites, amongst a few other dishes. Incredible. The server was fantastic, and the experience for an early dinner was great overall. To be nice, the only thing that stopped this review from getting 5 stars was that there was an unidentified object in our food --which we promptly told our server about. They were extremely apologetic, and I was very surprised that even happened to us at such an establishment such as this. We understand that no place is perfect, and they were more than accommodating about the issue. We really enjoyed the food, and although we had a slight mishap, we will definitely be back.
