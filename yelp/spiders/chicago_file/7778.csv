Art Institute of Chicago////Absolutely agreed on all the rave reviews about this museum.  It houses a quality collection that's large and comprehensive.  It is a must-visit, especially with the addition of the Modern Wing.  I studied art, visited museums around the world, and this one definitely ranks high on the list.  The building and collection layout is somewhat haphazard - not as organized as the Prado, for instance, but view its charming character as part of the overall experience, like the Courtauld.
