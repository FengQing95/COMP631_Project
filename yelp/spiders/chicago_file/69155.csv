Little Goat Diner////I don't think I'll be headed here again, especially for a burger. I ended up spending ~33 for a meal that left me wanting something else instead. Next time I'm in the west loop, I'll keep in mind that Au Cheval is right down the block, and as for drinks... I'd pass over this place.
