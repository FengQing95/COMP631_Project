Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Made a reservation (a must) and when we arrived they were very gracious and gave us a better table (upstairs instead of down). Their steaks are amazing and I had lamb this time, which was perfection. They have a small selection of salads but that isn't why one should go there. It's all about the meat, baby! Love the wine list and cocktails as well. This place is perfect for a date night or a small birthday dinner with your closest friends.
