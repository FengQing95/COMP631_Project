Little Goat Diner////Love The Little Goat....AGAIN!  Had the pork belly pancake.  It was unbelievable.  It was like the perfect mix of the most tender melt in your mouth smokey barbecue with crunchy lite cole slaw on top of a crispy pancake.  Ok, so I don't normally have a pancake with my barbecue but who cares it worked and I licked the darn plate!  You  just can't go wrong here.
