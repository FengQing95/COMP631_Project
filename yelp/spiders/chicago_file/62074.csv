Smoque BBQ////The only con besides the fact that they don't deliver was the saddest excuse for sweet tea I've had since the one time McDonalds accidentally gave me water. There was no sugar to fix it, just splenda. I wouldn't knock off a star for something like that, but I'd suggest bringing a packet or two of honey if you're a tea person. Otherwise, the fountain sodas are perfectly fine.
