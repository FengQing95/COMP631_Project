Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Part of Bavette's allure is that they don't imitate other steakhouses.  There's no muscular power-lunch ambience here; the décor is elaborate and sophisticated yet casual, dimly lit and oh-so-romantic.  The smaller downstairs room, reached by a delightfully spooky stairway with flickering candles, feels as exclusive and intimate as a private club.  The menu is unique, focusing on steak but also offering several dishes atypical of steakhouses plus options that you just don't find on menus everywhere.
