The Purple Pig////Hands Down ... it was my best meal in Chicago. I tried to get reservations but a no go. So we popped in after our boat cruise in hope to get a spot. The bar was open and so it began. The beet salad was on point, that pistachio butter underneath was unbelievable. Next up the charcuterie board to continue my lunch journey. My eyes drooled over the Pork Secreto, the dish was so tender and moist. To finish it off, Â pork ribs that fell off the bone. I needed to stop eating but I couldn't. Top notch wine list and great service added to the best time here.
