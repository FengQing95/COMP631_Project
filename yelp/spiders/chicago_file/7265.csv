Art Institute of Chicago////Unfortunately, I will not be going back there. I hope I can, however, use this review to warn other guests. Â Luckily there are many other museums in our beautiful city that have much more accommodating and friendly staff members than the Art Institute. They are certainly not a good representation of what a true Chicagoan is. Shame on you!!!
