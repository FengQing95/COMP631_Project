Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////If you're looking for a place to go with a group and not break the bank, this is your place. Went with 6 girlfriends, we shared 2 pitchers of sangria, 2 plates of paella and about 5-6 other tapas plates and we each spent $29 with tip after we split the bill 7 ways. We all left feeling very satisfied and excited to go back and try more on the menu! Garlic shrimp & buratta was amazing!
