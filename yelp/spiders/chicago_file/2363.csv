The Purple Pig////When it was my bf's turn to order a drink, he wanted a pinot noir.. the waitress' response was "No, why don't you have this instead". Going with the flow, my bf said sure, but didn't like her recommendation so sent it back. She then brought out another red w/o consulting him about what it was going to be (and he didn't like that choice either). She also said "you must not have a lot of red experience"... (IRL my bf actually refuses to drink anything but red).
