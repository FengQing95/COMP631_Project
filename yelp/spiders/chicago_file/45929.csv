Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is my go to date spot.  The atmosphere is awesome, and sets a great mood.  I love the tapas style, its very reasonably priced, and the food is awesome!  Its fun working with your partner(s) in crime on what looks good on the menu and working together on a bunch of different entrees to order.
