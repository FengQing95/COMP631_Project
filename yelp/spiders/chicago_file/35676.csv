Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavettes, hands down, is the best steak I've ever had. I went with the prime dry aged bone-in rib eye and I don't think I'll be able to enjoy another steak as much ever again. Flavorful, moist (cooked medium rare to perfection) and tender. I don't need to go on about it because excellent steak is that simple - flavorful and tender.
