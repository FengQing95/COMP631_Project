Little Goat Diner////This is the first restaurant I went to when I moved to Chicago, and I'm so glad I did because it set the stage. Make sure you get a reservation in advanced, though once I did walk in early in the morning and got lucky. Everything on the menu is delicious, but specifically the pork belly homefries, I won't go there without getting those. Drinks are good, service is fantastic, and the space is really fun and well decorated. It all works together for an amazing experience.
