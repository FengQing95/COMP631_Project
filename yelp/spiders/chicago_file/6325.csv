The Purple Pig////One of the best dinners I've had in Chicago. There wasn't a single thing I didn't enjoy. We got mushrooms, pasta, octopus, and a 1/2 duck and finished it all between 2 people. It was so much food but it was too good not to finish! I'd come back in a heartbeat because I'm sure everything on the menu is good!
