Smoque BBQ////Third: the house/bbq sauce.  I personally enjoyed this sauce however my parents do not agree with my opinion.  I thought it was very flavorful and had the right amount of sweetness and tartness to it.  My dad felt that the sauce was missing "something" and could be a little thicker.  In all honestly it isn't the best sauce I've tasted but definitely one of the better ones.
