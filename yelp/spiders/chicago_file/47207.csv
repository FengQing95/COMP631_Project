Smoque BBQ////Absolutely, bar none, the BEST Bar-B-Que joint in the city.  The ribs are to die for, the brisket is as tender as it gets, and the service is unbeatable.  We drive in all the way from Libertyville (a 45 minute drive) because it's a small price to pay for the privilege of eating the best Bar-B-Que anywhere.  Please let me know if it will be franchised to the northern suburbs!
