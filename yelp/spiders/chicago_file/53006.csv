Smoque BBQ////My husband and I were taking Smoque's out to a friend's house yesterday -- I called at 2:30 to place an order for a 5:30 pm pick up, and they didn't have any slots left at 5:30.  I got a 5:15 slot, and it was done exactly on time with no wait to pay.  All the 55 year old guys standing in line waiting to place their orders looked longingly at my efficiently packed brown grocery bag of BBQ heaven.
