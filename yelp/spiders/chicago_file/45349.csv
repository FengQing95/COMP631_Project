Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Everything here is very good, from their bloody mary, passion fruit sangria, and all the food. OMG! We love their bacon wrapped shrimps and spicy potatoes.  This is our go to restaurant when we go to the city.  There is never a wait and the service is amazing. The servers are very knowledgable and helpful when you are not sure what to order.
