Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Food was hit or miss--the veggies in the veggie eggs Benedict were over cooked in my opinion. The waffles with berries were great and the chorizo paella was very yummy. Was rather annoyed because I wanted to swap out the automatic papas bravas for a different side (same price) because I don't eat potatoes but was told no and I could only swap for a different kind of potato. Also my coffee mug was served extremely dirty.
