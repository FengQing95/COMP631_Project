Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I remember so many interesting occasions here:  a date with a guy that I had been friends with for a while, and then for some reason we decided to take it to the next step.  We came here for dinner, and probably to ease the inevitable nerves, we did shots of some nasty shit called "43" (I think that's they name, although I was half on the floor after that!).  Can't remember too much about the rest of the evening, but I know it was quite a fun night!  And times out with my best gf's . . . and did I mention how much I absolutely love their escargot with aioli sauce tapa?  It's to die for, and I would seriously order it in volume if I was about to leave this earth (note to self: put it on profile!)
