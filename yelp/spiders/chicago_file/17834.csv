Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Went here on a Saturday night at 7 pm and it was so incredibly crowded that we were barely able to squeeze into the door, into the back to back crowd of people around the bar.  Dinner waiting list was an hour and a half long, so we just had a drink and then left.  It was impossible to even turn around to see who was standing up against your back or leaning on each side of you.
