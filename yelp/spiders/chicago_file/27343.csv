Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////He offered us a thin crust pizza pie to try since we already have the deep dish pizza slices on our plate. We were really full by the time he brought that over. Then he kindly told us that the pizza will be on the house and apologized again. He definitely knows how to make a bad situation better.
