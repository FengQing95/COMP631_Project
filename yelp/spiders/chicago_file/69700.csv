Little Goat Diner////Not bad and way easier to get in to than the girl and the goat.  I had the shrimp and grits, while good, I found the dish to be way too soupy.  I prefer a good helping of grits but the dish had way too much sauce, drowning the grits.  The highlight of the meal was the macho nachos.  I definitely recommend getting these as an appetizer or your meal.
