Smoque BBQ////We pretty much finished everything because we're gluttons and because it was so good it would have been a waste not to. And then they had to roll us out of there. But seriously, I was full until lunch the next day. Next time, I would probably not eat the rolls that come with the sandwiches. They are good enough, but they take up valuable space in your stomach.
