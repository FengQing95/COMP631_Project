Art Institute of Chicago////The Louvre, Mus√©e d'Orsay, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Modern Museum of Art, and now there's the Art Institute of Chicago. These are just some of the wonderful art museums I've been to and I have to say I am surprised to say that this museum in Chicago can compete with some of the world's best known.
