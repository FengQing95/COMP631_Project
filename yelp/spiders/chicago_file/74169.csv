Little Goat Diner////My Sloppy Goat was phenominal!  Huge portions, the goat was ground and seasoned properly, the slaw was fresh, and the bread was the perfect consistency to hold it all together.  I also snagged a tostada from my friend's plate, and the fish along with all the toppings, was AWESOME!
