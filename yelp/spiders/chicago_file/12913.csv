Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We visited this location on a recent trip to Chicago.  When we walked in we were seated immediately.  Within 15 minutes of our arrival the wait for a table was 1 hour.  I would say that the hostess is without much personality and really didn't care whether people had to wait an hour or more.  BUT our server, ANNA, from Moldava, WAS INCREDIBLE.  She greeted us with a smile that never left her face the entire time she was working.  She was hustling the entire time we were there.  We ordered a salad and their signature pizza.  The pizza was perfect.  We bought a bottle of the salad dressing which was a "sweet vinaigrette" and just wonderful.  I have to say that I would go back over and over again.
