Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Enjoyed an indulgent, snacky, potato-heavy meal delivered from Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba during my last visit to Chicago. My daughter and I split Garlic Potato Salad; Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli; Brussels Sprouts Salad with Marcona Almond, Manchego Cheese (for balance, lol); Spinach & Manchego Stuffed Mushrooms and Goat Cheese Baked in Tomato Sauce. I had the Iberia Ham Croquetas all to myself. While it wasn't the healthiest dinner I've ever had, everything was very tasty and well made. Brussels sprouts salad is new find for me - I really hate the taste of cooked Brussels sprouts, but raw and cut up thin for a salad - delicious! This is fun food. Side note, we had one small issue which management was very gracious about and fixed right away.
