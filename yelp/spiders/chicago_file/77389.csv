Little Goat Diner////Neat restaurant, located in an area with other great restaurants, nice and friendly staff. The Items in the Menu are Asian cusine inspired with a few southern comfort dishes( Shrimp & Grits) really good. My favorite so far is the Pork Belly Pancake, nicley cooked and smoked pork Belly(chunk of bacon with meat) on top of a really delicious scallion filled frien pie/pancake, with some shredded cabbage( cole Slaw type) on top. Very Taste.
