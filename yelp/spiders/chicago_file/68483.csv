Little Goat Diner////The upscale diner atmosphere is appealing. While I have only been here for lunch, it has always been stellar.  The Cuban, which was a special on my first visit, was so delicious, I wish it was a regular menu item. The other sandwiches I have had were all huge and good. The fried pickles and onion rings are indulgent and a great side dish to share. The menu trends toward the fattening, not surprisingly, so be prepared for a heavy lunch!  The service has always been upbeat and efficient. The prices for lunch are in keeping with the portions and quality of the food.
