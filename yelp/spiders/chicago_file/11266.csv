Art Institute of Chicago////Admission is $25, but worth every penny.  Some highlights for me were the Asian art, they had an interesting modern Indian artist that had bright and thoughtful pieces sprinkled throughout the exhibit.  The collection of impressionist/post-impressionist art is massive - so if you like Monet, Matisse, Pissaro, Van Gogh, Gaugin, then this is the spot for you.  Picasso is quite present as well.  There's also some space dedicated to Andy Warhol, which was another highlight.
