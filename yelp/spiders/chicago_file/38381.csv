Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////They offer a Double cut pork chop that is the most moist and delicious chop I have ever had, a real stand out. Even the short rib stroganoff and meatball and fettuccine may be worth choosing over a steak. Yea, the steaks stand up just fine but you can get good steaks many places in this city.
