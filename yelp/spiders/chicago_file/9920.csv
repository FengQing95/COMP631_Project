Art Institute of Chicago////This place is a maze.  Their maps of the venue were ridiculously confusing but thank god there is a helpful gossipy staff security members in almost every section for the museum.  Sometimes perusing the artwork was a little boring but the lively security gossip was pretty fun to listen to.  With that said, the Van Gogh exhibit was awesome.  I wish the Starry Night painting was there but his bedroom sets (all 3) was a nice surprise.  Felt they went above and beyond to help you get into the artists mindset and life and really help you connect with their exhibits.
