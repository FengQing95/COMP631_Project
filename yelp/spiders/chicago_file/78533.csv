Little Goat Diner////Ben, we're thrilled to hear we've made a regular out of you with our creative and bold flavors that we're serving at brunch! It's definitely a tight battle between the Okonomiyaki and Los Drowned sandwich, but we agree that both are incredibly delicious choices to start your day. Many thanks for your continued patronage at Little Goat and we hope we'll see you again soon!
