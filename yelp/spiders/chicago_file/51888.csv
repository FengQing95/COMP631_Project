Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This was seriously some of the best food I have ever had. I'm visiting friends here in Chicago, and all I've been doing is eating delicious food, but this spot stood out for how amazing each and every single bite was. I got to enjoy a wide variety of items, including the deviled eggs (best I've ever had), meatballs, the ham croquettes, spicy potatoes, lamb kebab, chicken paella, manchego and spinach stuffed mushrooms (fantastic), and the chorizo wrapped dates.
