Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I am so glad I tried this new hot spot.  The Lillet Rose Martini was the perfect way to begin this delicious meal.  The bread was warm and crusty, which makes me so happy.  No one looked at me funny when I asked for more bread so thats a plus.  We had a crab salad, meatballs and spaghetti, and beef stroganoff.  The beef stroganoff was divine!!  The meatballs tasted a bit odd, definitely not the ones your mom makes.   It was extremely loud.  I would come here with a fun group to celebrate and then go out on in the neighborhood.  I definitely got the impression that the people who work there think they're the cats meow, but overall they were fine.
