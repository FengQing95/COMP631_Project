Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////A "Go Cubs Go" win followed by a Malnati Chicago Classic pizza.   The ultimate Chicago experience with a group of local friends.  They called ahead so we checked in and ordered our pizza in advance of our 7pm seating.  Tight quarters inside but well worth it.  Layers of cheese, sausage and sauce are simply perfect. I'm a fan and craving my next visit!
