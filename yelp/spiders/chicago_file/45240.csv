Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've taken just about every out of town visitor I've had there, and I've even been to the one in Vegas. Not bad for a corporate chain, but they seem to have a winning formula with this concept! They also have cool events such a cooking classes and wine tastings, so check out their website for updated events!
