Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food was exceptional. Wedge salad was fresh and crisp, and the bacon on top was fantastic. I would order bacon as side separately next time. Â The dry aged steak was very soft and flavorful. We asked for between med rare and medium, and it was cooked perfectly to the spot we wanted. The dressing for steak tasted too strong though. I felt simply some salt is enough to bring the best out of the meat. The cocktails were good too, but a powerful red wine might go better with the steak.
