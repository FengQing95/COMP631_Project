Smoque BBQ////I don't even know where to start. YUM!!!!! We drive in from Wisconsin at least once a month to have lunch (and we always buy more to take home) this restaurant was recommended to us by 3 different people that live in the area. When asked where to go for BBQ they all said Smoque and we have been hooked ever since. We stopped down on a Sunday and the line was out the door - and they food is worth the wait. There is a young man that seats the guests and he knows who we are - he is an AWESOME asset for Smoque. If I could give them more than 5 stars I would.
