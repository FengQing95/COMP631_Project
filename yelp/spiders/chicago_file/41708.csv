Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is a great place to take out of town visitors. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very warm and inviting, and the tapas make it easy for everyone to find something that they like. I haven't been to many tapas restaurants (pretty much just this one and Iberico), and while Iberico seems to be more 'authentic,' I like Ba-Ba-Reeba because of the atmosphere AND because they take reservations.
