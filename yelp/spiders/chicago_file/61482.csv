Smoque BBQ////Smoque definitely sets themselves apart from the competition by offering superior sides. The french fries are incredibly consistent, always hot and the right crispiness / tender, never limp or underseasoned. And the portion of french fries is decent as well. The baked beans and brisket chili round out my trio of favorite Smoque sides.
