Little Goat Diner////I popped into Little Goat Diner a couple days ago.  There was a Hawks game that night and hence the city was positively buzzing, making it tricky to grab a table at all the lovely eateries on Randolph.  I managed to get lucky on my second try, which happened to be Little Goat.  They squeezed me and my comrades into a tiny booth in a small corner.  Although it was quite cramped, the friendly waitress and some brewskis seemed to solve our problem (at first).  After a wait a trifle on the long side, our food arrived.  Upon first glance, my Banh Mi style burger looked pretty solid, but after a couple bites I realized it was nothing special.  My chum's Tonkatsu (consisting of a breaded pork cutlet and some asian bbq served on white bread) was also on the average side, so much so that I noticed him leaving half of it for the trash, even after the waitress asked if he'd like it boxed up.  The portions of these below-average entrees was also a bit strange - they were positively huge.  Our waitress suggested getting some sides, and our breadsticks (spoiler alert: nothing to write home about) and fries proved to be way more food than we needed.  Overall, although Little Goat is a cozy little diner in a great area, the food unfortunately did not impress me.
