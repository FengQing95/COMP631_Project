Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou's has been my go to pizzeria since they first opened. Their pizzas from the 70's taste exactly as they taste today. Quality and consistency are their hallmarks. There is no better deep dish in the Chicago area as over the years friends have dragged me to the competitors. Forever Lou's!
