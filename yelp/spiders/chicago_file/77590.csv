Little Goat Diner////Every time I come to Chicago I have to make a pit stop here for breakfast. First off the ambiance is great, looks like a Midwest diner except for its brand new and extra trendy-- photo-booth right by the entrance. There is a coffee shop connected in the back of the restaurant which also holds extra seating.
