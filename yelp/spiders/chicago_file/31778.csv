Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place does not do deep dish pizza justice. If this is your first exposure to deep dish, you will have a poor impression of it. This is my second deep dish pizza attempt and I have to say, Lou Malnati's did not deliver. Very doughy on the bottom. Not crispy at all. Not delicious.
