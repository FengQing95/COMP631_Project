Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We've dined at this Lincoln Park institution numerous times over the years, and have always enjoyed the experience.  Our most recent visit came on the heels​ of my daughter's college tour of DePaul.  It was a Saturday afternoon and the place was packed. Come to think of it, every time I've been here its been busy.  We were seated right away, but by the time we left there appeared to be a slight wait.
