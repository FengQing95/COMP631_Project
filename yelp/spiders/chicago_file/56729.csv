Smoque BBQ////This BBQ here is OMG DELICIOUS. I went here because Guy Fieri recommended this place and he has yet to lead me to a horrible place. The line was out the door and around the corner, but it was worth the wait. I got my food to go because the place didn't have any seats. Â I waited and had my food within an hour. The beef brisket is so tender, the cornbread is full of pieces of corn, the chili has a smoky taste and the coleslaw is made just how I like it, with vinegar instead of mayo, YUM-O. The baked beans were perfect, I will be back, but I will phone first next time.
