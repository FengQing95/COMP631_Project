Little Goat Diner////Meh. Our highlights were the lovely interior & a really nice waitress & a gluten free menu with several good options & a very tasty virgin Bloody Mary. The host stand staff was downright rude in all interactions and the food was just ok with each dish having notable flaws (overly greasy corn beef hash, undercooked pancakes, hashbrowns that tasted as if they'd been cooked in oil that was starting to go rancid). Given all of this plus the wait and the price point, not sure I'd give it a second chance.
