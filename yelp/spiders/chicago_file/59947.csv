Smoque BBQ////Onto the food.  I had the Pulled Pork Platter w/2 sides, comes with slaw.  The pulled pork was good, but not excellent.  The sauce wasn't what I was expecting.  Slaw was eh... it was like a few sprouts.  The Mac & Cheese would have been great, if they gave you more than a tiny cup of it.  And the fries were really good, the best part of the meal.
