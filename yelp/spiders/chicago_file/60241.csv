Smoque BBQ////So I settle for the St. Louis ribs. And I was not impressed. The rub on the ribs was only OK. The meat itself was just OK. I smelled the sauce that comes on the side. Smelled great, so I poured it on my ribs. And it proceeded to run all down my fingers onto my hands. The darn sauce is too thin! Not cool. Hopefully it'll wake up the flavor of the meat. I took a bite of the sauce-soaked meat, and it was a tad bit better. But I'd have to say that it's best to stay away from the ribs, at least the St. Louis ones.
