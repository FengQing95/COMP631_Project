Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////If you have Foursquare, your first check in earns you a FREE pintxos platter. We got to sample each of the pintxos they had. We especially liked the short rib stuffed pepper and the chorizo wrapped medjool date and cheese. We also ordered the passion fruit sangria pitcher, which was really good as well. Very light and refreshing.
