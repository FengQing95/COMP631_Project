Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was soo excited to try this place. I had high expectations for deep dish pizza, and honestly, I was a little disappointed.To me it's not as good as NY style, but if you like see dish it's still good pizza. Fair warning, it takes. FOREVER. To get your pizza. Make sure you get an appetizer!
