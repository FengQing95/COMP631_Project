Art Institute of Chicago////Always a favorite.  Of course, they're known for their impressive Impressionist collection (see what I did there???) but some of their real gems are hidden in the corners.  Don't miss their Asian art section, the Miniature Rooms, and American Art, which is all but hidden in the basement.  I also enjoy the Modern art wing, if for no other reason to overhear the other visitors say "I could do that!"
