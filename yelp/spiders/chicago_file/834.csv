Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Totally worth every minute waiting for a table (waited an hour).  The food here is fantastic.  Had the country skillet with pumpkin spice pancakes (seasonal).  Food came out quick, and our waitress was awesome (too bad I forgot her name).  Going back here next time I get a chance to visit Chicago.
