Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have to say, for my first time eating at Lou Malnati's, I most definately enjoyed my experience. My server Colin was prompt and accurate with our order, and the busboy Scott was very helpful in suggesting what to eat. If I was ever to eat here again (which will be highly likely) I would very much like to have them cater to our hunger needs again. 5 out of 5 for a very enjoyable meal.
