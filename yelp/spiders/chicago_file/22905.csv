Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visiting from Montana and this was our first stop in Chicago after a long day of travel. We were able to order while we waited an hour and a half to be seated on a busy Saturday night. Once seated the pizzas came and were cold as they were obviously done well before we were seated. I think if my wife and I didn't each order an individual size they would have been warmer. But definitely disappointed. The flavor of my wife's was very good.
