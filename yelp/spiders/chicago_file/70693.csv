Little Goat Diner////This was my first time at The Little Goat and it didn't start off very well.   I made a reservation for a mid-afternoon lunch via OpenTable (which showed they had plenty of availability) and they didn't have our reservation when we arrived.  The waiting area was packed and we were offered to wait in the bar and they would text me when our table was ready.    We probably waited about 20 min when the host came and got us.
