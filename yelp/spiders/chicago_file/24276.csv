Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Arrived at 9:15 pm on a Sunday evening. We utilized yelp to help us satisfy our deep dish urge while visiting Chicago. We already knew what we wanted to eat, so we pretty much ordered right away. The server changed right after we ordered (not sure if this is where the communication failed?) we were told it would be 35-40 mins for our 2 small deep dishes, both with 2 toppings only.
