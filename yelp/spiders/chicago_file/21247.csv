Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Perhaps the best genuine deep dish I had in Chicago. The wait was definitely worth it, from the moment we put our names on the list, waiting. As for waiting, they use a system that can send you text when your table is ready. It's actually very convenient and cool. The server was nice, and we ordered a salad that was very fresh. Liked our visit.
