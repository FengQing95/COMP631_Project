Little Goat Diner////My default rule at all diners is to order eggs, meat, and toast. Â  My default rule at a pancake house is to order the omelette and pancakes. Since this was skewed towards a diner, I was going to order some farm fresh eggs, bacon, and toast for my meal, but I was intrigued by all the pancake options, especially the sourdough pancakes. I initially told my waitress that I wanted those, but then I became indecisive and withdrew the order. Looking back on it, I should have ordered those with a side of eggs and bacon.
