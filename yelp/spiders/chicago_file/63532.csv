Smoque BBQ////This place was on my list for a long time, after reading about it many times I had to make the trek here. Of course I also had to order the Brisket since that's what they are known for. The ordering process was streamlined, wait in line, order, be seated, food comes, and that works nicely considering the volume this place does.
