Smoque BBQ////The food arrives.  The ribs rock.  The chopped and pulled brisket are each good in their own way.  The side dishes, beans and mac n cheese are really tasty.  This is really good BBQ.  I begin deliberating with my guest about whether this is Texas BBQ or Southern BBQ or St Louis BBQ (is there such a thing?).  My eating companion doesn't care, and says that it is really good, and that nobody likes a pretentious foodie who tries to sub-classify food.  I am so jacked up on meat, that I brush aside the injurious criticism, and gently assure myself that it is not my fault I am dining with a BBQ rube.
