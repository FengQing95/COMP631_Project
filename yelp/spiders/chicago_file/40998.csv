Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Last year we attended a rehearsal dinner at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba and it was wonderful!  My boyfriend, who didn't think he liked tapas, loved the food and we had a great time there.  So, when it came time for us to find a caterer for our wedding, we called Ba-Ba-Reeba.  I worked with their special events manager, Alison.  She was great to work with!  She was very professional and quick to respond to my many questions.  We actually decided to hold our wedding out of state, but if we had gotten married in Chicago I would have booked Ba-Ba-Reeba in a heartbeat.
