Little Goat Diner////The two of us oped to share the Brandade and Belly and a tiramisu milkshake. The milkshake was fine, nothing special. It tasted more like plain chocolate and wasn't screaming with the flavors of tiramisu. The Brandade and Belly was also alright. It was certainly enough food for two, but the flavors were not memorable. Rather than being a marriage of the brandade, pork belly, egg, and kimchi, it was more of a mishmash of disparate flavors on the same plate. And the biscuit was a bit stale.
