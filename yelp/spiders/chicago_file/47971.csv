Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is a hands down fantastic Spanish tapas restaurant in Lincoln Park. Let me just say, their bacon wrap dates are so top notch I can barely help myself but to order them first. My husband and I have been to Chicago 5 times. We have also now been to this restaurant 5 times. It's that amazing.
