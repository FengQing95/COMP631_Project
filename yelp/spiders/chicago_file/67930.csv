Little Goat Diner////I would say pass on the Mac & Cheese it really wasnt all that special. It felt like it was missing something. I also wish they just served regular fries, the only thing close to fries were the smoked fries but I really don't eat pork and they are hickory smoked with ham I believe (as explained by our waitress when I stated I did not want any pork on anything) so I opted out of ordering them.
