Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I won't ever forget that you left everything you had in DC for Chicago to bridge the physical gap between us. I loved my once every three weeks excursions to the big Illinois city to visit you. You would always plan fun ways to show me around or we'd just keep warm inside and order pizza.
