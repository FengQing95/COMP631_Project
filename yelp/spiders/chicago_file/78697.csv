Little Goat Diner////My experience with the drinks unfortunately did the place no favors. It is borderline malpractice to sell a non-bottomless carafe of mimosas (i.e., OJ + champagne) for $50. Good lord. I instead chose a subpar cocktail with tequila and white wine, which tasted kind of flat and unbalanced. My Haymarket Blood Orange Ale was a solid outdoor beer though.
