Art Institute of Chicago//// Â Reminds me a lot of the British Museum of Fine Art. Had that same feel. I do think that the Art Institute of Chicago is better. More significant pieces. The quality and the number of outstanding works by MAJOR artist spanning multiple eras and movements is truly exceptional.
