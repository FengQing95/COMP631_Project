Art Institute of Chicago////Paintings tell stories. It is such a cliche that people tend to forget to "read" them. The Italian masters illustrated many episodes of the Bible, the Classics in general got their inspiration from mythology, epics and the Big book of History, still lives are graphic descriptions in the way of the naturalist authors, the deformed characters of Picasso exemplify on the canvas the multiple focalisation at work in the literature of their time, and so on.
