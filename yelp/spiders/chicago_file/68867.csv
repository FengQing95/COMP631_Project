Little Goat Diner////This was my first time visiting Chicago and I'm really glad we stopped by such an adorable place. For starters the logo is so cute! I love how they give out free buttons with goats on them. The food was delicious! We ordered the fat Elvis waffles, I spent the rest of the weekend dreaming about how incredible they were and wanted to go back again to order more! The diner is hip yet feels vintage and I love how everything on the menu can be ordered at any time throughout the day. Plus they serve alcohol too. I would definitely come back here again
