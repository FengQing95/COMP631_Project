Smoque BBQ////In the end I ordered two pounds of the pork, two of the brisket, two sausages (I thought I'd ordered three, but I could be mistaken) a quart of the beans, six cornbread and two slabs of ribs, one of each kind.  It was a little pricier than I expected it to be, but all things considered it made a damn good meal for me and my guests and it was ready when it was supposed to be, and packed very well.
