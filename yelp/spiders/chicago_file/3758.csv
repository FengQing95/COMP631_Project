The Purple Pig////Awesome place! Great food and atmosphere. Food came out quick and delicious. Ordered the octopus, squid, whipped feta, bone marrow, beets, and lamb. Paired all with red wine and stout. Split among 3 of us . Highly recommend! Put down our name. They estimated 40 min wait but sat us in 10 min.
