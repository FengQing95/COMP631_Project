Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is an ultra dim restaurant.  The light from each table's candle makes you feel a little woozy and/or like you're on a cruise ship.  Or maybe it was that amazingly crusty-on-the-outside-soft-on-the-inside-freshly-baked-and-piping-hot bread served pre-dinner that made us woozy.  Mmm mmm mmm.  Get your hands on some of that (and notice the breadshelf of loaves at the back of the restaurant awaiting to be served)!
