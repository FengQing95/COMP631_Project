Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been coming here for years and I went there Saturday night around 9pm and we were seated right away.  But once we got to our table we had to replace one of the cups of water because it was dirty.  When we went to grab the plates we noticed that there was food stuck on the inside of the plate and there were food crumbs on four more plates.  The waitress had to just replace the whole stack of plates.  When it came to getting our food we didn't receive any bread until we asked for it and when the food came the bacon on the bacon wrapped dates were burnt.  Lastly, for dessert we ordered the caramelized banana which we've had before and it was supposed to be a banana with a caramelized crust with sugar which they brulee the top what we got was a raw banana with some caramel sauce on top.
