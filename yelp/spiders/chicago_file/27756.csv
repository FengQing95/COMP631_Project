Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Deep dish pizza is one of those things you HAVE to try when you're in Chicago! I heard this is the best deep dish place in the city so we decided to try it! My husband and I came here for lunch and got super lucky by getting seated right away!! Literally 5 minutes after we got seated, a crazyyy rush of people came in and their wait time was about 45 min to an hour.
