Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Their burgers? one of the best Ive had in Chicago. But I always do the pork chop because its just ridiculous. Super flavorful and cooked to perfection. But if its not, they fix the problem immediately-and with a smile. Oh-and PLEASE get the truffle fries. They are cooked in animal fat so the flavor is stupid good.
