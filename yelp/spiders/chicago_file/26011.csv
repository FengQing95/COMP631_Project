Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time having deep dish pizza from Chicago-and did NOT disappoint!!!! Have nothing to compare it to, but thoroughly enjoyed the cheese pizza with buttercrust!! Expect a longgggg line (minimum of an hour)-so consider calling in your order ahead of time. Took our pizza to go and pizza remained hot entire way home because they wrap to-go orders of pizza in plastic!! Would definitely return to Lou Malnati's for more pizza!!
