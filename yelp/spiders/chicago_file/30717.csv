Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Finally the pizza came out and it was HUGE.  I excitedly took the first bite and it was just EH.  Nothing special.. as I continued to eat more, I started to come across SUPER salty parts of the pizza.  It was as if they dumped a pile of salt onto the pizza.  At first I thought it was just me but my girlfriend experienced the same saltiness! I also didn't like how they just throw on huge slabs of sausage onto the pizza... like cut it up into pieces or something?!  Literally blocks of sausage on top of our pizza lol.  Meh... such a disappointed.  It wasn't bad, but I definitely don't think the pizza was worth the wait or the hype.
