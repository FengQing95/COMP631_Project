Smoque BBQ////The food's fantastic, really is.The brisket and pulled pork are both cooked very well and the barbecue sauces have great flavor. The brisket has a great smokey flavor which is not overwhelming either. I haven't had the ribs but from friends who have, they say they're very good and the meat comes off the bone well.
