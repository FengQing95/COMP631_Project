Smoque BBQ////I was pretty disappointed with Smoque.  I had heard great things about this place from friends who used to live in the neighborhood.  When I walked in, I noticed that while it was not packed, the scene was chaotic. In other words, the staff obviously did not have their stuff together.  I would hate to come when it is crowded.
