Smoque BBQ////The ribs were delicious, the brisket was so tender and juicy, and the cornbread was perfect.  Even with the long line, the staff made things incredibly efficient and made sure we had a place to sit.  It was raining, so they put umbrellas outside the entrance in case the line stretched outside.
