Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My husband and I LOVE this place. We love the roast dates with bacon, goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, and braised short rib! This is the perfect date night spot. Must have reservations on weekend unless you are okay sitting at the bar. We are not fans of the sangria (not because it isn't good!) because it isn't very strong. We have ordered wine based off waiter recommendations and have always been happy!
