Little Goat Diner////Deocr: It should come as no surprise that this place has a hipster vibe to it. The d√©cor doesn't really allude to it that much, it feels a bit more like a '70's diner to be honest, but you can feel the vibe. You shouldn't hold that as a negative, however, because it is very well lit (via natural light from the windows and HUGE skylight) and everything is very clean and open. The setup is nice too, there are plenty of tables and booths of different sizes along with a counter you can sit at if rolling solo (like I was).
