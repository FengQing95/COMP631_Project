Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Food was great! Our buser was amazing our server Erika was horrible. Didn't ask how was our food and our drinks. She just dropped the check off and walked away. Told her to have a better day while she just stared at me. She was playing with her hair in the corner as well which is awesome. We tipped the busser personally because he did an amazing job.
