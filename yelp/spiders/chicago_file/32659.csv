Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////One of the best meals I'd ever had was at Bavettes about a year ago. So when planning a trip back to Chicago for Fourth of July weekend I knew I had to go again. Bavettes truly did not disappoint. Everything was just as amazing as I remembered. The standout item is definitely the bacon, which is unlike any bacon I've ever tasted, or really anything I've ever tasted. I could have ordered bacon only and been happy! We ordered it with the wedge salad, which is highly recommend.
