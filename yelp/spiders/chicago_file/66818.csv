Little Goat Diner////On a Monday for lunch, not much of a wait.  My favorite dish was the fried pickle sandwich.  Some other dishes that are good: paratha burrito and spanish omelette.  Service was good.  Place seemed very crowded but service was pretty fast.  I would definitely go back and try some other dishes.
