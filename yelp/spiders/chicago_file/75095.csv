Little Goat Diner////That is the driver for my review, because my group of six got about 15 different items on the menu, and it was extremely hit-or-miss.  I personally ordered the fried pickles/onion rings and Machos Nachos (both pretty good, especially the chips in the nachos) plus the biscuits and gravy for dinner (crazy bland) and a chocolate shake for dessert (I get shakes twice a week; this was the worst I have had since moving to Chicago, way too milky with no consistency).  I tasted the sloppy joe sandwich (not bad) and the Los Drowned (very good, maybe the best thing we ordered at the table) and the fries (above average).  One of my friends ordered the brandade & belly benedict and left half of the meal on her plate.
