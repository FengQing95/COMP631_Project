Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm giving this place no stars for the gluten free pizza, why bother serving an inedible pizza so that you can bring Gluten Free customers? The regular pizza might be good but for GF, forget it, it also took a long time to get the gf pizza which was a waste of time. Hey management , please do not advertise that you serve gf pizza because it was awful and the worst, sorry but I had to write this.
