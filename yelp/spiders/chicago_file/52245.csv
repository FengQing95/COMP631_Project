Smoque BBQ////There are no servers but as you wait in line to order your food a nice employee will walk up to you and ask how many people you are eating with. He will then try to find a place for you and your friends to sit together amongst the bustling little seating area. This is not a great place for groups. The second time I went here I was in a group of 11 and we were split up at two different tables. Not a big deal but it will happen. Whoever you go with though expect to interact with your neighbors. The tables are close to one another and the seating area is usually full. It's kind of fun but it doesn't create a great atmosphere for long coversations or a romantic evening. If you come here you should come here to eat and little else.
