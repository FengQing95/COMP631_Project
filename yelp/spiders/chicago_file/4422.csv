The Purple Pig////Tucked away off of Michigan Ave, TPP (a.k.a. "The Fuchsia Porker") has a small dining room and a lively -- but deafeningly loud -- environment. Â Communal seating is just how these guys play the game; if you value your personal space and quiet time then maybe this isn't the spot for you.
