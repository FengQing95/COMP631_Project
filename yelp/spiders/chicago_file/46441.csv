Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here with high hopes as I have heard good things. Waitress was very short with us, friendly, but very little interaction. The food all came out quickly as it should for a tapas experience. We ordered a pitcher of sangria, 7 tapas, and 2 desserts. Sangria was large for the price and tasted good. Food was a let down, only really good dish was Brussel sprout salad. Empanada and patatas bravas were ok. Hangar steak was  very bland and calamari mediocre. Desserts were both good.  Cafe Iberico will be the move next time.
