Art Institute of Chicago////I spent my first time at the art institute this past week when i was up in chicago for vacation. I was overwhelmed with how large the museum was. It was simply breathtaking all of the beautiful pieces of art that it holds. I really liked how the museum was sectioned off in different rooms and wings depending on the style/genre of art and the artist. I have been to my fair share of museum but this one surely takes the cake. I was extremely impressed and had a wonderful afternoon browsing through the museum.
