Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Wildberry makes really great breakfast and brunch food. The waits can be a little ridiculous, but that seems to be par for the course for brunch in Chicago. Their lattes are really outstanding, and they make delicious skillets and omelettes. I have never tried any of their sweet offerings, but their savory food won't disappoint. I do think the service is a little inattentive at times (especially with water refills), but it's a great brunch option, especially if you go at a time with a shorter wait.
