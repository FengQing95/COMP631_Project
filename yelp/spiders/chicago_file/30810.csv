Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The wait if no joke, but given how good their pizzas are..it's worth it. We went there around 6:30 (thinking we were 'going to be the crowd' HA) and then ended up in an hour long wait. They do allow you to pre-order your pizza so that when you are seated it doesn't take as long to get to your table.
