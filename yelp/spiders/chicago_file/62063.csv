Smoque BBQ////I was in the restaurant just a few minutes before they closed as I awaited my carryout order, and while there were loads of customers still eating at the tables and a bunch of workers moving about, it didn't have a stressful atmosphere at all. The people who work there all had super friendly demeanors and the food I was served was hot and delicious.
