Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////So where did you take your very Christian, very picky about eating "strange" food parents to eat when they are meeting your boyfriend's Asian parents and brother that like to eat "unusual" food.  I know! Let's go to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba.  After all, this is the first place that we ate on our first date.  How perfect and it was... I always want to get my parents to try new things, though things like calamari are different for them.  Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba offers perfect choices for both the Asian parents and the white parents to try new foods.  It went great and the food was amazing as usual.
