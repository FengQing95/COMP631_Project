Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Have been here once before, it was amazing. Came here today and it absolutely sucked! Checked in at 8:43 got a text at 9:23 came in waited another 15 min. They sat us at a booth my husband and my 10 and 2 yr old. The table smelled like wet dirty dish rag. Got some juuces! Great! Ordered finally got food at 10:20am and the food was cold! I let them know and they offered to make a new one but I'm here with a 2 yr old and it's been two hours. Very disappointed, won't be back but, it won't hurt their pockets.
