Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Can i give it 10 Stars or 5+ stars? I came here to dine after nearly a decade and it was a sweet experience! Met up with some gal pals in this totally packed restaurant and of course started off with a pitcher of white wine sangria. Every single tapa we ordered was outstatnding. Spicy potatotes, something goat cheese, peppers, eggplant , squash, brussels sprouts i cant remember them all. The only thing we didnt care for was the paella and our server Danny quickly replaced it with other stuff and had the manager come and talk to us and apologize. Danny was phenomenal with customer service, very attentive and didnt get flustered with us constantly flagging him down. Also, we were given free desserts on the house along with taking the charge off for Paella. Â It was one of the best enjoyable meals that i have had in a longtime which was also very inexpensive(literally, $20/person plus tip).
