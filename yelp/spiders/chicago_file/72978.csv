Little Goat Diner////The menu is fun and creative with everything from traditional blueberry pancakes to breakfast spaghetti with clams and crab!  I wasn't adventurous enough to try the latter so instead I got something light and refreshing - biscuits and gravy!!  This dish comes in small and large sizes (naturally I got the large...), which turned out to be the perfect size.  The biscuits were large, fluffy and smothered in delicious sausage mushroom gravy.  My boyfriend got the "Bull's eye French Toast" - a combination of french toast, strawberries, BBQ maple syrup, and crispy fried chicken.  I know, I know, it sounds like a strange combo, but I found it absolutely delicious!  Definitely worth trying.
