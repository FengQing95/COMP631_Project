Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Third time's the charm! My boyfriend and I came here for a third round and the food and service were both above and beyond. We didn't have a reservation but luckily we managed to snatch a walk-in table at 5:00pm. We shared the foie gras terrine, which was packed with plenty of foie gras. I had the equally delicious short rib stroganoff. The meat was tender and juicy and the sauce creamy and buttery. I especially enjoyed the texture of the pasta, which was slightly chewy with a nice bite at the end. My boyfriend had the lamb chops, which.. dare I say it.. were the best lamb chops either of us have ever had. Crunchy salty exterior and nice and pink in the middle. It almost melted in your mouth it was so tender.
