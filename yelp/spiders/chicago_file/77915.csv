Little Goat Diner////I would advise making reservations we went on a Friday at 130 we had reservations, however with out them we would have waited an hour. We ordered heavy, because I had wanted to come here for forever and wanted to get a good overview of menu. My litmus test is the cinnamon roll. It was AMAZING! perfect not too sweet the frosting/ glaze was perfect, it's definitely a sharer! The service was also nearly perfect. Food came out at appropriate times and waiter was available but not annoyingly attentive.
