Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Upon entering Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba you are greeted by a very kind hostess. There appears to be plenty of seating around the bar, along with two sections of the dining room. Reservations can be made online or by calling. The wine list is quite extensive, and has several spanish wines to choose from. All of the dishes are quite good, and when ordering from the tapas section of the menu, the dishes arrive quite fast. With two people plan on ordering about 4-5 plates to split. The staff was extremely nice and attentive. I will be visiting this spot again for sure.
