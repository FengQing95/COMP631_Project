Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////To start, I ordered the soup of the day which was the corn chowder. They need to put that bad boy permanently on their menu. It was one of the better corn chowders I have tasted. If it's available the day you dine here, give it a try especially if you're a fan of chowder like myself. Another app we ordered was the Malnati salad. Our waitress said that this was a great choice even though in the back of my mind I was questioning: how salads can be possibly that great? Little did I know that the Malnati salad lived up to her words. Whether it was the potent and effective gorgonzola cheese or their classic Lou's dressing, the bowl was spotless after we were done with it. The medium size was more than enough to share between two people.
