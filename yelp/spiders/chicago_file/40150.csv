Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way.
