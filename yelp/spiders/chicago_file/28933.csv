Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Amazing!!! Best deep dish/Chicago style pizza I have ever had. The mushroom/spinach with the butter crust was to die for. Unfortunately, I live on the west coast, so can't have it as often as I'd like. Though I just found out that the store does shipping anywhere in the US. It's definitely be an awesome treat every now and again!
