Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Service is very good, the ambiance is amazing. The food is out of this world (NY aged and bone in, Rib eye), the side dishes are amazing ( elote, macaroni and the mashed potatoes). Great drink selection (cocktails, table wine and hard drinks). Good temperarure. Nice people and very good music. Dinner for 2 with drinks $200+. Would I come back? Yes, I would most definitively come back.
