Little Goat Diner////We hit up Little Goat for lunch around 1:00 on Monday and we were seated within 5 minutes. The place was packed so I was very happy we were seated quickly. Everything is "a la cart" so if you order a burger or sandwich, you'll want to get a side also. I choose the fried pickles and onion rings and all American beef burger.  My partner got the patty melt beef burger and the smoked fires. We both loved the fried pickles and the accompanying dipping sauces. My onion rings were awesome and reminded me of the ones I used to get as a kid at my favorite restaurant. My burger was very tasty. It reminded me of the burgers at Frisch's Big Boy, and that's a good thing. Partner loved his patty melt burger. But we both devoured the smoked fires.  They had a great flavor and made them stand out over regular french fries.  After we finished our meal, we walked next to door to Little Goat's coffee and bread shop and grabbed some exceptional Americanos.
