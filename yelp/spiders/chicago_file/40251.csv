Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////When we were seated, I asked for some more time to look at the menu and we were not helped until I flagged for the waitress(we waited for another fifteen minutes before we asked for help). The food was served 45 minutes after our reservation time. Our bill total was about $250 and we ordered the 1lb King crab, sizzling shrimp, and classic ribeye. The king crab was stale(definitely not even 1lb), a very chewy ribeye(lots of tendons), and the shrimp was okay. There was a lot to be desired for the amount that I paid for.
