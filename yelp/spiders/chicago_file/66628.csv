Little Goat Diner////Had a really great experience here from the service to the food. We were seated immediately on a Friday afternnon which was a great way to start off. Our waitress was amazing. I wish I could remember her name so I could give her props. Actually Map Props. Arguably the most infomed waitress I have experienced when it came to the menu. She appeared to know everything and very detailed as well. Everyting we threw at her at least which was quite a bit for a table of three. Now to the food. Yes I got a burger. As you should know by now I may be a bit obssessed. I realize the burger game in Chicago is very fierce but I must admit it was one of the best I have had in a while. Â I ordered the beef mushroom burger medium rare and it was cooked perfectly and delicous. Them buns though! So good. And them smoked fries! On point. Not overly smoked, thin and crispy. A new twist on a burger staple that I really appreciated..and as a bonus there were enough for the whole table. I loved having the option of ordereing a burger and my wife being able to order a delicous and unique breakfast, as sometimes we are on different food pages. She had the Asian breakfast and loved it. The coffee was some of the best I have had in a restaurant. I am really looking forward to going back sooner than later. It will be hard to not order the burger again but there were many options that sounded delicous and I would love to try including a goat burger.
