Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My wife and I travel to Chicago for Christmas every year, and discovered Bavette's last year. We remembered liking it, but wanting to try someplace new, we decided to just go for a drink this time. We arrived somewhat early (around 6:00) and went to the downstairs bar. I love the ambiance here! Leather, wood, dim lights, and not too loud. The drinks we ordered (Vesper and an Old Fashioned) were also excellent. Some of the best we've had actually. We also ordered some oysters since we had time to kill before our dinner. We tried two different kinds from the East Coast, liked one more than the other, and then ordered some more of our favorite. The second order arrived with the wrong ones. It was corrected fairly quickly with a new chilled bowl and the right oysters. I felt like it was handled well, however, my wife felt like the waitress gave us a bit of attitude. All in all a good place. I'll definitely come back again and stay for dinner. If the dinner is as good as the drinks, I might give it 4.5 to 5 stars.
