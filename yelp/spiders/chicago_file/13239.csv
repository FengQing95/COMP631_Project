Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Some of the better Chicago-style pizza I've had, but somewhat lacking on atmosphere.  I topped my pie with diced tomatoes, sausage, and garlic.  In retrospect, I should have left the garlic off - they took this addition very, very seriously.  Also, the sausage blanketed the entire pizza.  I don't think I had a single bite without a giant piece of sausage.  I may as well have ordered a pork chop on the side.
