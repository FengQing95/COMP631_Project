Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've dined at Bavette's Vegas location first and when coming to Chi Town, realized they have the original here, I had to stop in!  Reservations were difficult as they are packed but I was able to secure a late night in the parlor downstairs.  While waiting on the beautiful dining room couches waiting for our table, we got some drinks and those were made well!  The food and service at Vegas was amazing and I was expecting this one to be the same.  I was told Parlor (only available seating, and was only available at 10:15pm vs dining room 10:45) was better, darker more romantic.  My wife and I loved the Chicago ambiance of the restaurant and classic speakeasy layout.
