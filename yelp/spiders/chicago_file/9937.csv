Art Institute of Chicago////I loved the Museum and the people that work there are amazingly helpful. We started off with some modern art than the older European art and photography. The rooms are massive! And its impossible to do the museum in a day. I think it would take a couple days to finish the museum. We went on a Friday and the museum gets packed. We didn't get a guide and I think it would honestly hold us back from the pace we were moving. We were trying to take it all in but it's so much and you want to appreciate it all. I didn't take any pictures inside the museum because I felt like that would take away from my personal experience. I did however take a pic of the outside. It's a wonderful museum and must do if your in the area.
