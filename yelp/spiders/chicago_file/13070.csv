Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I live in Chicago and am not a fan of deep dish at all. I've tried here and it's just way too much cheese and not enough pizza. For me, all the ingredients have to mesh well together. When you eat their deep dish, it's just globs and globs of cheese. Disgusting for me. And then today, I tried their thin crust and it was just bland. The taste wasn't there whatsoever. I will give them props on the salad..the bomb! O won't be back.
