Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were recommended to try this place by a friend. I had never had deep dish pizza before and was very eager to try it. We came on a Thursday evening and the place was packed. However the hostesses were very service minded and they had a great system for writing down your number and text you when your table was ready. We waited in the bar and was seated within 30 min. We ordered one deep dish pizza with pepperoni and one with sausage. It was good but nothing amazing or impressive. I will stick to my thin pizzas.
