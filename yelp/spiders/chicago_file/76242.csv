Little Goat Diner////First bite in was a doozy. A mouth full of fat, no meat... just a mouth full of fat. Don't get me wrong, I love bacon, and pork belly, and pig fat in general. But a mouth full of pig ass fat was just overwhelming. It coated my mouth and took a few rounds of the corn to clean my palate.
