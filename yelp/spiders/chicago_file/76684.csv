Little Goat Diner////This place was really good.  I had the beef dip sandwich.  The meet literally melted in my mouth.  My friends all had the goat burgers and lived them.  You really must have reservations.  There are single counter seating that seem to be easy to get in.  I recommend, it is a little pricey, but the quality of the food was amazing and made the price worthy.
