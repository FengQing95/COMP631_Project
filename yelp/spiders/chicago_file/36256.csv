Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Eric paired a perfect cabernet to go with our dry aged ribeye.  IT WAS SO PERFECT...it almost brought tears to my eyes.  Perfectly executed medium rare and butchered to the perfect thickness.  So flavorful that it doesn't need the bearnaise and seasoned steak salt that its automatically paired with.  However, after a few heavenly tender bites the glutton in me ventured to the best bearnaise I've ever had and the steak salt added a new fun dimension of flavor as well.  Cream spinach was well balanced and broiled for an excellent texture to go with the flavors.  Elote style corn was robust and delicious and the fries didn't disappoint either.  Everything we had I could easily order again.
