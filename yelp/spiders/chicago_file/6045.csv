The Purple Pig////We also tried the pigs ear, octopus and broccoli. The pigs ear was my second favorite. The strips were crispy tasty little treats that complemented the sunny side egg well. The octopus was tossed in a great seasoning that tasted delightful. The only let down was the broccoli. It tasted as if it was fried in old oil, the flavor was off and the quality of the dish was not comparable to the others.
