The Purple Pig////We came here to celebrate our anniversary. This place is known for long wait times and not allowing reservations. Not luckily, but luckily because of COVID, they are currently doing reservations. So we're able to walk in with our reservation and get a table right away. I will admit, this place was very casual and I felt like we were over dressed. They were very professional throughout the night and did really great explaining every dish and giving directions on how to eat the food so you can get the best taste out of each dish. Jimmy Bannos Jr. even stopped by our table to talk a little bit and made sure we were enjoying our night.
