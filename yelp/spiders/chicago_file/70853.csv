Little Goat Diner////Highlights: Pork and toffee shake-- sweet and smoky, rich. I loved the salty bits of toffee. I don't have a huge sweet tooth so this was a good way for me to try something dessert-y that actually appealed to me. Smoked fries-- absolutely perfect, and the smoke flavor is strong. Don't make the mistake of not saving room for these like I did.
