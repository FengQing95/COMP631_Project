Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza itself was quite good. The toppings were fresh and flavorful, the crust was flaky and delicious, and the tomato sauce was just right. The price was reasonable, too, especially compared with other deep dish joints around town (see my other pizza reviews). We were content after eating 4 of the 6 slices, and I happily took the leftovers home with me.
