Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I really don't discriminate against any kind of pizza, so I tend to think that all pizza is good. Lou Malnati's went above and beyond what I thought good pizza was and now stands out as my favorite pizza place. "The Lou" is just incredible and the thin crust cheese pizza is exactly what you need alongside it. So delicious.
