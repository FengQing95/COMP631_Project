The Purple Pig////Food was good. Pastas were my favorite but the duck was a close second. Salmon was fine did not stand out. Bone marrow was fine as well but there was a lot of bone. Dishes are probably shareable among 3-4 people but less so among 5-6. Interesting diner type vibe which I understand is different than before they moved. Lots of hard surfaces which made things seem a little loud. Good observance of COVID precautions though it was cumbersome to put on our masks mid meal for the server to bring each of our 10 courses.
