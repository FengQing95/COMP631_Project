Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Today was my first time at Wildberry and I cannot wait to return! The 45 minute wait was well worth it and honestly made my friend and I more excited to try it since so many people were willing to wait. Once seated our server, Kathleen, was very efficient and attentive. Our food came out promptly and was hot and fresh! Nothing I hate more than being served lukewarm entrees. I ordered the Venetian Skillet and substituted the regular pancakes for the Signature Berry Bliss-best decision I've ever made! The pancakes were light and fluffy and overflowing with berry goodness. The skillet provided the right balance of savory with the sweetness of the pancakes. The portions here are extremely generous you will likely need a to-go box. Having been to many brunch places in Chicago, Wildberry takes the cake! Definitely will become the go-to spot for brunch with girlfriends or when relatives come into town!
