Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We recently had our rehearsal dinner here and our experience really blew me away. The cost per person was extremely competitive to a lot of restaurants that host rehearsal dinners. They printed our menus for us and accommodated the many dietary restrictions we had and put those on the menus as well. Just perfect. My husband and I had dropped our decorations and gifts off earlier and planned to set it up before guests arrived. When we showed up the team had already put our table decorations up and set all our gifts neatly on a table. We were so amazed and surprised and what a great job they did - all we had to do was relax before our guests arrived. Our waiter was so personable and fun and he always made sure everyone had enough food and drinks (there was A LOT of food). Perfect location for our rehearsal dinner.
