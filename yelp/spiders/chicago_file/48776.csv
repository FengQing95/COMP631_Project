Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went here on 1-11-2014 for my moms 54 birthday. The waitress was somewhat rude and looked annoyed at our group since it was a larger one. Took them for ever to bring our drink orders and they were overly crowded. We had made reservations a head a time and I recommend you do since it was so crowded you wont get any walk in seating. The dishes were ok at best we had better at other Tapas places. The Spicy Potatoes where not spicy and the flavors were all bland... I had specified that it was my moms bday and they didn't do anything special no candle nothing. .Ok ....they gave Â us one 3 dollar dessert after her rudeness that was the least she could do.
