Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Neither my sister nor I are fan of deep dish pizza after our meal. We definitely prefer thin crust. I never thought I would say no to extra bread. However, the pizza crust isn't very flavorful, so the extra crust makes the pizza rather bland. To me the cheese, sauce, crust ratio is off for deep dish pizza. Too much dough!! I'm still not a fan of deep dish and I think my next trip back I won't be going out of my way to try deep dish pizza.
