Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place had exceeded my expectations considering how busy it was. Our food arrived very quickly, the empanada was nice and flaky. The calamari was great and the short ribs were fall apart tender. My favorite was the seafood paella though, it was a ton of food....the shrimp & scallops were very fresh. Highly recommend this spot!
