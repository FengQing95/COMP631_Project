Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Fig in omelette is amazing and rare to have in restaurant! All its major entrees--omelettes, skillets, egg benedict, etc--come with fruit & hash brown or pancake. Its Signature Berry Bliss pancake has fresh berry and berry cream embedded within the pancake batter and topped with more fresh berries--strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries. You can also customize everything. I ordered veggie omelette with extra figs, substituted fruit with salad. With pancake, everything only costs $11! Great food, service and awesome view of Millenium Park made my day. I wanna go there everyday!
