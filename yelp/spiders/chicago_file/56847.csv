Smoque BBQ////The sport of kings: Horse racing. The meat of his heirs: PULLED PORK. So Smoque, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways. You and your pulled pork  can go toe-to-toe with anyone, anywhere, anytime. I admit, I was surprised and humbled by the people who would attempt such a dish above Interstate 4O. That stuff will make you want to fist fight a rude man just because everything else is right with the planet while enjoying meat that is of varying color which is normal. Yes, there can be a bit of grease. Guess what, take that away and you got beef jerky. It's like comparing a fillet with sirloin. Marbled means magnifique. Smoque's had less grease than any PP I've tasted. That means when the pork is pulled, they actually may discriminate against a few pieces. To come in Smoque's and not order PP is like going into Mike Ditka's and not eating the veal chop. The knowing chaps and chapettes  give each other a wink. All seven judges concur, even the contrarian Bulgarian judge. This PP is a 1O.
