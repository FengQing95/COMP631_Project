The Purple Pig////I finally ate here after many trips to Chicago, and I will definitely return. Simply the best octopus I've ever eaten. Bone marrow with herbs. Salt-roasted beets. Croatian red wine. Outstanding service. Not inexpensive and that may be a concern, but well worth the investment in my view. Fresh, well-prepared and presented, and so good. I felt like going back to the kitchen to congratulate someone...
