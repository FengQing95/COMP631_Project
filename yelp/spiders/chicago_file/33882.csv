Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Came here while in town for business. My colleague and I ordered the Filet Mignon, which was well worth the money. Bone Marrow and crab cake to start, which were both excellent. Cocktails were delicious and the service was on point. Came in around 9 without a reservation on a Tuesday and sat at a high top table. Seemed to be a hot spot in the area. Will be back next time I am in town!
