The Purple Pig////Honestly was pretty disappointed with this place. Everyone used to rave about purple pig being a good restaurant but all of the food was very average. All of the food was basic. Whatever you do don't order the octopus. Biggest waste of money, the consistency was gross and no flavor. Tasted like cheap frozen fish. Our server was nice, no issues there. Just really really mediocre food for the $200 we spent
