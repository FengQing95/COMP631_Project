Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The Ribeye was a beefy 22 ounces, dry aged for 42 days with the bone in. Of course they will slice it up for you prior to bringing it out and it comes with their salt/pepper mix and some great b√©arnaise sauce. Get it medium rare. You'll thank me. So juicy with great flavor and a brilliant crust.
