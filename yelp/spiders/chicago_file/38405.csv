Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I made up for the price discrepancy by also indulging in bone marrow, which is not unlike the marrow you'll find in Bavette's sister restaurants like Au Cheval and Maude's. In terms of others, the elote-style corn is the most recommended, and also well-deserved. It's a wholly decadent side, just doused in cream, butter, and parmesan. If you like pampering with a kick, the corn's your huckleberry. And yeah, that seafood tower is both visually and tastily impressive. The grand tower is replete with shellfish galore, allowing you to eat, rinse, repeat at your leisure.
