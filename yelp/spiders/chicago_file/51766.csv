Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////However CBBR doesn't really grace me as one of the best tapas place in the world but it is in the tippy top of the list for tapas in Chicago. It's just that the menu is not as expansive as a traditional Catalonian tapas menu. Sure you got your croquettes, kebabs, salt and olive induced choice of food... However it just doesn't have the decadence that other tapas restaurants have made a stable of.
