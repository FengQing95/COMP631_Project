Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Every pizza joint in town claims to be the best. Been to Giordano's in the past (which I enjoyed more) and told I had to go to Malnati's. Pre-ordered a cheese and Chicago classic (poultry sausage on butter crust dough) deep dish. Pizza came and...nothing special. It was pizza. One had cheese and one had sausage. We ate it and left. Still looking for the best deep dish in Chicago.
