Smoque BBQ////I don't know...what did I miss?  The workers were really good and friendly, the place was packed about about 9pm on a Saturday night.  But like others have pointed out, I was expecting MUCH better based on the prior reviews.  I got the 1/2 and 1/2 which was pulled pork and brisket.  The pulled pork was pretty good...not amazing...the brisket was extremely dry and most disappointing.  The accompanying sauces were good...the mac'n cheese was average at best.  Maybe I went in with an expectation of world-class bbq and didn't get it.
