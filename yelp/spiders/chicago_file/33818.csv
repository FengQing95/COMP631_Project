Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bone in Ribeye- served with perfect Bernaise (just the right amount of tarragon) - cooked a little on the medium side of mid-rare, but well rested, good char, good rendered fat cap. Not Ã¼ber aged tasting, but a solid steak in a steak town. They had a nice flaked salt served on the side that really brought out the flavor of the meat which was just what the doctor ordered.
