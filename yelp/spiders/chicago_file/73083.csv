Little Goat Diner////Service: it seems no one working here has heard of the concept of guest right-of-way, and our server was tough to catch on our most recent visit (early on a Saturday evening, granted). When you up-sell me a $2 biscuit that I did not really want, it should not arrive at room temperature; that's just bad marketing.
