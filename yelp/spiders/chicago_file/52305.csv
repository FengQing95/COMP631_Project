Smoque BBQ////I've never eaten here in person, but whenever one of my friends hosts a party, Smoque is the place of choice for informal get-togethers. They have been pretty consistent with the taste and quality, which is alot to say when you have to feed 10-20 people. I am a fan of their dry rub ribs, no so much of their pulled pork, which tastes overcooked. The brisket is nicely done and juicy, and the mac-n-cheese puts the store variety to shame. One of these days I will get around to going there in person, but for now, my ribs come in a pan. Yes, I fight for the left-overs.
