Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Once seated on the patio our server (Desere I think) greeted us right away and made some menu recommendations.  We got another pitcher of sangria and set out to decide on items from the menu.  We got a small lobster paella (which takes 30 min) and decided to order our first round of tapas.  The easiest way we found to do this was to have each of us pick one plate and then all share it. The highlights from this round were the goat cheese stuffed mushrooms and escargots and the spicy potatoes.  Although I enjoyed everything I found the hot tapas dishes on the greasy side.  The big hits for the table for the second round were the hot goat cheese and the roasted tomatoes filled with tuna.  The food came out very quickly.
