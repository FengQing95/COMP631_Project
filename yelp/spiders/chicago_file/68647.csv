Little Goat Diner////As the Yelp stars say, Meh. I have experienced better. I was very excited to go here after hearing so many rave reviews from friends. I went with my mom on a Tuesday at 5pm. Definitely no need for a reservation. We were seated at a booth and it looked promising. The music was kinda...eh...like rap-hip-hop-esque that killed the whole mood. Then the terror from behind us began. This little child (I like to call him the beast), maybe 2/3 years old kept looking around the booth at my mom and I, sticking his tongue out at us. Thankfully it stopped for the most part during our meal.
