Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My impression of the pizza here was "meh." I ordered their "signature" sausage with their butter crust and was pretty underwhelmed. I think the pizza here is on par with giordanos but a step or two below pequods or kaisers (my place of choice for deep dish; the latter is wayyy up north in Gurnee but man it's delish).
