Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My girlfriends and I tried several cocktails, but I particularly loved their sparkling rose.  We started with the baked goat cheese, which came with slices of toasty, crusty bread.  Followed up with some oysters.  I went with the braised veal cheeks....sooo rich and delicious.  My friends both selected the beef stroganoff, which was an elegant version of what mom used to make.   Sorry mom, but Bavette's stroganoff is way better!
