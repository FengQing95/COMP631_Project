Little Goat Diner////Great little diner but the Girl and the Goat folks. I had the El Diablo Agave drink for starters and it was amazing. The Bulls Eye French Toast was super delicious. It comes with chopped buttermilk fried chicken and egg inside the French toast and topped with strawberries and syrup. My coworker had the Reuben sandwich which was also tasty. Â I must say that we had a fantastic bartender, Matthew, that was extremely helpful and made great drinks. Definitely try this place.
