Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This has been our favorite pizza place for many years. We had to wait an hour and 45 minutes for our pizza even though we pre ordered it. And then it came somewhat undercooked with soggy crust. We didn't bother to complain because we knew it would take another hour and a half for it to be replaced. Will never go to this location on Wells street again.
