Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Delicious!  Went on a Sunday around 9:00 and it was packed -- 40 minute wait.  They get you through in a timely fashion, without feeling like you're being rushed.  Had the corn beef hash skillet, which was delicious, but seemed to be overwhelmed with the hash brown.  The next time I'll get normal egg breakfast with hash on the side.  Pancakes are light and fluffy.  Location is very convenient to train station.. great place to grab a hearty breakfast before jumping on the train.
