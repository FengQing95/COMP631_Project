Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Got a personal size pepperoni pizza with Buttercrust and additional mushroom topping. It was tiny! And the pizza wasn't super hot when it came- the cheese was kinda thickened and not melty. Sad. The crust didn't blow me away- was pretty unimpressive, really (not light and fluffy as they described it). More squished and crunchy. Left me wondering what the normal crust looked like and whether I should have just gotten that instead of paying extra for Buttercrust.
