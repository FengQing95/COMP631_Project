Little Goat Diner////Wow what a restaurant. Great, cordial and quick service; even with a packed house. Food was awesome! The fried pork chop sandwich was delicious. Order the fried pickles and onions; to die for. And the waffles with fried chicken had us coming back again the next day for more. Great restaurant, unlike the stuffy, long/long/long.....long, ok u get the picture, long wait restaurant down the street: Au Cheval. What a difference. Even got the T-Shirt!!
