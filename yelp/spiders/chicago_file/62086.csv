Smoque BBQ//// Smoked for 15 hours?? All that really means is the meat is dry ass shit.  You wanna to eat real Ribs? Then you better find a 54-65 year black man named Willie or Joe Ingram who slow cooks his ribs while he is piss ass drunk, on Kingsford charcoal with mesquite chips and makes a sauce you'd put on your cereal.  Im a white boy whose father did business in black neighborhoods and that is what i grew up on and that bbq blows away anything you will eat here.
