Art Institute of Chicago////We bought our tickets on line before we went, which helped avoid waiting in line. On the back of the visitors guide, there was a "What to see in an hour" which pointed out the key places to see if you are short on time.  Can't wait to go back someday to see what we missed.  Such a great place to get lost in!
