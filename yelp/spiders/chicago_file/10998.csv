Art Institute of Chicago////It's always drama in this place but only one security guard was able to direct me. I don't remember his name all I know is that he was a heavy set Latino man, with long curly hair. He stopped what he was doing just to actually direct me to where I needed to go. I come in today and I was told he was fired. You actually have a heavy set man who moves around to help people as others just point fingers and say go that way. Lost my commitment of frequently visiting this place.
