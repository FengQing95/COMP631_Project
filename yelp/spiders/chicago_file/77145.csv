Little Goat Diner////I don't think you could get a bad meal here if you tried. Their potatoes are probably the most delicious thing I've ever eaten. They make their own bread, so their English muffin with smoked salmon is absolutely incredible. Seriously, there are so many good things on this menu, I could eat there every day for a few weeks and be completely happy!
