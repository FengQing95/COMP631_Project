Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza is great. The service is excellent. The staff are friendly and patient. However, do NOT get toppings unless you want to be ripped off. My girlfriend and I got a small (10", serving 2) cheese pizza with olives, garlic, and peppers. We did not read the menu that carefully because the restaurant was insanely packed and we pre-ordered.
