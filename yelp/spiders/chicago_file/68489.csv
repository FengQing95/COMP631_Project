Little Goat Diner////This is a hip place with great food. The decor was trendy, but classic. There was a mix of people there on the Friday afternoon we visited. I felt a little out of place since we had two little kids with us, but the staff was very friendly and made us feel right at home. I hade the Bullseye French Toast, which appeared to be a play on chicken and waffles. It was delicious. My wife had the Almost Drowned. In all a great sandwich, but very messy with the au jus. They have a kids menu, which pairs well with the diner theme. I washed everything down with a great beer from the drink menu. Overall a great experience and I thought the prices were good considering who owns the place. I hope to go back soon.
