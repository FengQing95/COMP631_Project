Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Here is the bad new.  There is some kind of drug in Lou's pizza because once you have it you will want to come back and miss it when you do not have it.  This is some of the best Chicago Deep Dish pizza in Chicago!  They buffalo wings are also great!  A very busy place but what is nice is that while my friends and I were waiting for our table we were able to place an order for our deep dish which was soooooooooooo delicious!  Nice looking place and our waiter was awesome!  I have been to two different Lou location and both were awesome.  You cannot be in Chicago and not try this place.  A plus is if you are alone there are personal pizza's that you can order which some pizza places do not offer.  I have been to other great pizza places but I gotta say Lou's is the best!  Definitely a Chi town must visit!  Be prepared to have heartburn after ha ha ha.
