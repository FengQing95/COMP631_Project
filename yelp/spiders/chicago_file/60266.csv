Smoque BBQ////My friend Ewa and I went here for dinner tonight because she loves ribs and Smoque is famous for their ribs.  She ordered 1/2 and 1/2 Rib Plate, which is half slab Baby Back and half slab St Louis style ribs.  For a skinny Polish girl, she can throw down some ribs.  300 lb police officers were in there getting to-go boxes for the same thing, but Ewa ate every morsel and left a pile of bones on her plate!  I had beef brisket sandwich and mac and cheese.  Our clothes still reek of BBQ.  The owner was so friendly and delivered our food to our table for us, then brought us extra bread warmed up just for us!  It was worth the 20 minute wait in line.
