Smoque BBQ////What the brisket might lack, I think the pulled pork makes up for. I really love the pulled pork here and think it is their most consistent and well-done dish. The pork is succulent and moist, with just the right amount of crust. The sauce at Smoque is excellent with the pork, with the vinegar base serving as a perfect contrast for the sweetness of the pork. The large white rolls they serve their sandwiches on are perfect for soaking up a good amounts of BBQ sauce.
