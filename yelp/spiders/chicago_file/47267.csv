Smoque BBQ////I was just sitting around flipping channels when I saw the Diner's Drive-ins and Dives BBQ Masters Episode come on. It reminded me I have been to this place (because I'd seen it on Triple D before going there) and I had never given an online review. I've told anyone in person it's amazing food, but I felt I had to say it here too. The Brisket, the Pulled Pork, the Beans, everything... it was ALL Delicious. To me atleast. One can only go off personal opinion. Anyone I've spoken to in person enjoyed it and it deserves a 5 stars. Not everyone will enjoy it, though, of course.
