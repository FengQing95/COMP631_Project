Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Loved this place. The ambiance is amazing - French 1920's - esque. The staff was great - we sat at the basement bar before dinner and the bartender was so nice and had great recommendations and our waitress was so great and attentive. They have a BYOB policy as long as you share a glass of wine with a table around you and the food was fantastic and a little more reasonable than other steakhouses. I will definitely be back here again!
