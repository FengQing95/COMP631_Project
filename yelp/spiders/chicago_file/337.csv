Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Every time I am in town, I try to hit Wildberrys for breakfast.  The selections are great.  The omelets are awesome, and the pancakes are too.  I have had both the veggie and fresca omelets made with egg whites along with multi-grain pancakes and all thumbs up!  Get there early even on weekdays, it is very popular by both the locals and out of towners.
