Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////What the heck?!? Since Zachary's, Paxti's and Little Star are my favorite pizza places, one of the things high on my list of things to do while in Chicago was to have Chicago deep-dish pizza, and according to Yelp this is one of the best places to go. So we went, at lunchtime on a weekday and it was *packed*. There is very little space to wait for a table, but we figured it was worth it. We ordered The Lou. But when the pizza came, the crust tasted like Bisquick, the cheese wasn't tasty, the toppings were just OK, and the whole thing was so not what I was expecting. Maybe we went to the wrong place? Maybe I don't like Chicago Style Deep Dish Pizza after all, I just like Bay Area Style Chicago Style Deep Dish Pizza.
