Little Goat Diner////If I could give no stars I would! Weak drinks, terribly slow service and THE RUDEST bartender I've ever encountered: claimed to be sober but she was clearly Â under the influence of something since she was so rude and aggressive. Honestly borderline violent. Walk a short ways down the street: you'll get much better service. Thank
