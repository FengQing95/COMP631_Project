Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is my pick for an anniversary dinner and my boyfriend did compliment me for an awesome choice. Yay me! We had their filet mignon , classic chicago cut ribeye, creamed spinach and their elote style corn, all are absolutely perfect. I must say, Â the Bavette team made our anniversary extra special. I cannot wait to come back and hopefully very soon.
