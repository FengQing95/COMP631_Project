Smoque BBQ////The greatest BBQ in all the land.  Also, great service.  I like how they seat you where it works out the best for all patrons.  It gets around one of my all-time pet peeves - people who 'save' seat s while their friends are in line for food.  People!  In the time that it takes your friend to order and get food, an entire other party could have eaten at the table you're saving.  You're messing up the flow!
