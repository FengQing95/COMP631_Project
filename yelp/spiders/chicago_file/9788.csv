Art Institute of Chicago////3. Special "Member Lounge" with complimentary coffee & tea.  There is a nice little counter and several chairs and couches in the lounge to rest your tired feet & get a little caffeine pick-me-up.  In the nicer months the Member Lounge has a little outdoor patio area as well.  The lounge is small, however, so during peak times you might have to wait for a seat.  The Member Lounge isn't' the easiest to find so ask a museum employee if you have trouble locating it (it's on the lowest level next to the cafe).
