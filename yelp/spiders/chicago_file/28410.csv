Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I really think Lou's is the best deep dish in Chicago! The crust is crisp and flavorful (which I find lacking in most other deep dish places), the sauce is good, and the toppings are great. I usually get their spinach and mushroom pizza - and I'm never disappointed! The salads are also really good, so make room!
