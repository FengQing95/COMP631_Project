Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I'm so confused with why the ever so trusted yelpers gave this place almost 5 stars. I was about to go to Mastro's but I seen the reviews on this place I decided to try something new. Big mistake. Don't get me wrong the atmosphere and service was amazing. But the steak Fretta and mac & cheese was average at best.
