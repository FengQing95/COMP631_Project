Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The ambience in this place is awesome. I ate the filet mignon 6 ounce that was mediocre at best but then again I am from Texas so I've had much better steaks in my life. The truffle macaroni and cheese was delicious and the lemon meringue pie was equally as delicious. This seems like it would be a great date spot because the ambience is just magical.
