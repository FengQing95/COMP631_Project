Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////So Joel shows up to table and says how is everything? I said well.. not good. These steaks are burnt beyond recognition. It leaves a horrible taste in mouth..it was not that the outside had a nice char on them as he states or its just the ends it was entire thing. I said look Â took my thumb and index finger and pinched the middle of the steak and got so much charr black burnt on my fingers rubbed them together and showed him..the blackness that was there after even seeing it he kept denying saying it was fine. In my head I know better have HAD BETTER. Have dined all over not that I write reviews for every experience. Have had DK steakhouse in Hawaii, Michels Colony Surf in Hawaii traveled and ate in Europe and am a great cook.
