Art Institute of Chicago////It has an amazing Van Gogh Poet's Garden, which they keep moving and making it hard to find, and a gorgeous interior garden with a neoclassical fountain that is especially cool when you're a small child and everything looks huge, but nice even as an adult. Overlooking this is a gallery that includes a small, podgy, pugnacious satyr from ancient Greece. I sent a phone photo of it to an artist friend, who responded succinctly, "what in tarnation".
