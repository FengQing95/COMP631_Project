Little Goat Diner////I had the Los Drowned which was delicious! It was meaty and came with a rich broth. Some chips to accompany it would have been recommended. My girlfriend had the parathas burrito. Parathas shells are so addictive and it encased an egg cheese mixture that was delicious. I thought the salad on top might ruin the flavor but they were all great. Then I decided to follow it all up with some tempura mashed potatoes which tasted exactly like tempura mashed potatoes should taste. It was a unique dish and the crispness of the tempura was a welcome addition to the meal.
