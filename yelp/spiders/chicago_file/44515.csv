Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////With 839 reviews, mine really doesn't matter, but here goes: Â I went on a Friday night around 7:00, with no reservations. I usually hate to wait, but wifey gave me that "look" which I interpreted as "For once in your f*cking life will you please wait." Hey, there was a bar, that was very well staffed, so I agreed. Within 10 minutes we snagged a few stools at the bar, and were immediately approached by one of the 4 bartenders they had working. We opted with the white Sangria, which was very tasty, and reasonably priced at $6 a glass.
