Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////i am updating my rating to 3 stars - my family and I gave it another try, and i'm so glad we did!  we ordered the thin crust pizza this time and it was so yummy!  the crust smelled buttery and amazing and had the perfect level of crispiness.  the mozzarella sticks are still my favorite.
