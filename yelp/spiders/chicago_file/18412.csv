Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pizza was great, there was a ton of sausage on the pie, and it lived up to the name! My hubby and I were visiting Chicago for the weekend and everyone said Lou's was the place to go, and we're very glad we did!! The bottom crust was a little larger than I expected for deep dish compared to Geno's we tried last time in Chicago. But Lou Malnati's was still the best pizza we have had. We will definitely be back to visit our next to Chicago!!
