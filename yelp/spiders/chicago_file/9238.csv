Art Institute of Chicago////My husband isn't the type to get enthusiastic over brush strokes (but would definitely enjoy cracking a joke over the word "stroke,) but he enjoyed himself by making up his own names for various works of art which varied in creativity from "I call this blue!"  to "I call this X."  If you aren't into art, at least have a sense of humor, and you will enjoy yourself here.
