Little Goat Diner////Very nice space. There are terrific plates available. With the communal seating,it's hard not to socialize with others. The opening night was as expected,crowded. There were some server errors. My wife received the wrong salad order. Though resolved immediately . The couple next to us had their order delivered to the party next to them . Though they ordered the same plate but after the couple sitting next to us. They both actually chuckled and decided to share the plate since they were expecting another. After the bugs are worked out this will be a fine add to the West Loop Mecca of Chicago dining.
