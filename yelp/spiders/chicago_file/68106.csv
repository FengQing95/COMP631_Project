Little Goat Diner////Delicious pulled pork sandwich on a huge, buttery bun.  The "cole slaw" and pickled red onions were all mixed in with the pork, so it was a fun spin on an old favorite. The smoked fries were awesome but HUGE - would have been enough for four people to share.   And the Choco Taco dessert - sour cream gelato, pepitas and chocolate-dipped tortilla chips - yes, please!!
