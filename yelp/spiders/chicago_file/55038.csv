Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////EVERYTHING IS GOOD. I've been here twice on different visits to Chicago and will keep coming back. Sangria is ahhmazing and food is even better. The prices are all reasonable and you get to try several things on the menu (tapas) so it works out well. For two of us, we ordered 4 tapas and weren't quite able to finish it all, but was totally worth getting to taste the dishes. The atmosphere is pretty "hipster" but also family friendly. Highly recommend!
