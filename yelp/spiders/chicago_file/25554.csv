Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////BEST DEEP DISH I HAD! Okay so we had to wait over an out to eat here but it was well worth the wait! It's nice they have different size pizzas so you don't have to order a huge one if you don't have many people eating. The place gets really crowded so it's hard to find a place to stand if you're inside. I'm glad my friend recommended this spot to eat. It did not disappoint!
