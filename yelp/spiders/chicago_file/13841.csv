Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have a hard time rating Lou Malnati's because the food is awesome, but the service is always bad.  Whenever we make a trip to Chicago, we make a trip to Lou Malnati's, because it is some of the best pizza you will ever have.  The pizza is always perfectly cooked and is cheesy and delicious.  But again, with the service...The last time we were there, I asked about an IPA on tap and the server had no idea what beers they had.  He took our drink order and it took a good 20 minutes for him to come back and get our food order.  Overall, I decided on 4 stars, because like I said, the food is awesome.  Highly recommended, but don't go if you are on a time schedule.
