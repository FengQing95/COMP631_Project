Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We started with the salmon Caesar salad. The salmon provided a nice added flavor to a good Caesar. We shared a couple of dry aged, bone in ribeyes (medium rare of course), which were sliced for us (to make serving easy as we were all sharing). The steaks were cooked perfectly and were top notch! The mashed potatoes were creamy and addictive. The corn was decadent with a trace of heat. It's hard to pick which of the two sides was better.
