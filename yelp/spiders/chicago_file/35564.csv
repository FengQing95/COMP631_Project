Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Another awesome meal at Bavette's. This is probably my favorite steakhouse in Chicago. The ribeyes are Stupid Good. Service was much better this time, and their corkage policy is awesome! We brought a big, fancy bottle and delighted in sending a glass over to a fellow diner.
