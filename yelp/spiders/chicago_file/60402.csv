Smoque BBQ////-  1/2 rack of baby back ribs - These were pretty good - maybe B+/A-.  They had a nice smokiness and bark to them.  The texture was solid (not extremely tough or "falling off the bone"), but they could have been a little more tender. Overall, they were tasty, but could've been a little better.  However, they were my favorite of the three meats I sampled.
