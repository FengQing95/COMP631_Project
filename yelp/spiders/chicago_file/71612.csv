Little Goat Diner////Little Goat diner is a unique experience. All of the fun food that Girl & the Goat would offer, but a more relaxed atmosphere. You can go for breakfast, lunch or dinner! The menu is there all day! I love the meatloaf. You can't go wrong with any of their dinner classics. Stop over at the bar/bakery/coffee bar next door before or after you arrive. You won't be disappointed.
