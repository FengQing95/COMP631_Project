Smoque BBQ////Very nice rustic feel to a place with great flavors.  Personally my favorite part is the Bourbon and meat combinations, natural flavors that go hand in hand.  Service is great, food is good, restaurant is very loud!  Now, one thinks that I am the quiet, reserved type by stating that. Quite the contrary, but I don't like yelling across my table to talk about everyday subject matters.  I don't know if its the people, the layout, or lack of sound absorbing ceiling tiles, or what it is, but its loud enough to keep it from being a five star review.
