Little Goat Diner////The omelet of the day was a Crab Rangoon omelet. Basically an omelet with crab rangoon filling, topped with sweet and sour sauce and fried won tons. I debated because I love crab rangoon, but the thought of Â sweet omelet turned me off. Our server assured me that the sweet/sour is very subtle and he was spot on. It was well made, the filling was just enough and the flavors went well together.
