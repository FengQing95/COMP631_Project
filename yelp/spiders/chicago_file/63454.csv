Smoque BBQ////Got there on Saturday afternoon a little after 4.  Virtually no line which is why we get there at 4.  The brisket was moist and fork tender as usual.  Outstanding.  It cracks me up that in spite of the Smoque manifesto that plays down fries and BBQ as a less than desirable pairing, they were excellent.  I tried the Texas sausage and wasn't impressed but I go for the brisket so no worries.  I also tried the baby back ribs and, contrary to what others have reported, these are not the fall-off-the-bone variety.  And that's a good thing.  They were meaty but not fatty.
