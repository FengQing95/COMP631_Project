Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Simply put: not enough cheese, not enough crust, too much sausage.  But that might be your thing so go here if you want a less bountiful deep dish experience. Also, there's no taste of freshness either; like everything came out of a can.   I prefer the Pizzeria Uno Deep Dish much more; the distribution of cheese to crust to sausage ratio is spot on.
