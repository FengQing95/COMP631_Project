Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////To me, you have to use quality, fresh ingredients to set your pizza place apart.  I know Lou's is cashing in on the tourist factor and long lasting name.  But as a local (new), I'll be taking my visiting family members to Pequod's in order to show them deep dish in the city.
