Little Goat Diner////But look: I'd give it 3.5 if I could. I keep going back here because there are things I like, I've just had enough negative experiences that I stick to the things on the menu that I know I like. But it's easy to get a table, bright, well located, and has a good beer list, so all in all, above average.
