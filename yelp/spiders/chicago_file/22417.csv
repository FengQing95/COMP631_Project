Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For how much hype this place has I unfortunately wasn't terribly impressed. Getting a name on the reservation list was a feat in itself there were so many people around and it was so disorganized I had a difficult time even getting my name down. It took at least an hour which isn't surprising for how popular it is but there was nowhere for people to sit so we walked around. Once we got our table we got our pizza. Just a heads up you have to order your pizza when you get put on the waitlist if you want to get it within a reasonable amount of time after you sit down. The pizza was yummy but the atmosphere was crowded and noisy and once again disorganized. I wouldn't recommend it based on the atmosphere
