Little Goat Diner////I really enjoyed this place. Reminded me of Portland. Had numerous things on the menu I wanted to get (like Pulled Pork Sandwiches and Sliders and other wonderful things). I ended up getting the Fried Chicken and Waffles. There was a bit of a wait but there was a pastry shop attached to it with delicious treats and coffee. After we finished that we got a seat outside. It was my favorite place to eat outside so far. The street almost feels like a small town with all of the trees on the sidewalk. In fact, I felt I had the best seat as I was surrounded by trees and seeing no skyscrapers besides the massive Willis Tower. It was like being in a small town with one giant building in it. After we finished we found out that someone anonymously paid for our delicious meal for us as they saw we were in uniform. What a life. There's also a few other great places to eat on that street.
