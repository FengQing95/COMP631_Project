The Purple Pig////Pasta of the Day: there was no specific name for the pasta of the day, but it was a chicken bolognese sauce served with linguine pasta and garnished with stinging nettle and micro greens. The pasta was not too heavy and fragrant. After this dish, I think I like chicken bolognese more than beef bolognese.
