Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////It was worth waiting in the long line. Personally, I am not a big fan of brunch restaurants. I have been disappointed by a lot of 4+ yelp star brunch restaurants in different areas over the last few years. However, this one was different. I tried turkey burger, pancake and omelet. (Sorry, don't have the exact names.) I particularly liked the turkey burger which also contained avocado pieces in it. The pancakes were awesome, too. Not so greasy. Not too sweet. I would come back soon.
