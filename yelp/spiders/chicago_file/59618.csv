Smoque BBQ////I would have given this place 5 stars, but I'm taking a star away for the horrible excuse that is their coleslaw.  I know that everyone may do their slaw a bit different, but really there is no reason to deviate from the creamy goodness of traditional coleslaw.  These guys do and it's not a good deviation.
