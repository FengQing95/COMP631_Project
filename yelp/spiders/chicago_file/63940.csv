Smoque BBQ////You know when you have an idea of what kind of BBQ you like, but never quite find it? Well, that's the way it was for me before I visited Smoque. I've tasted many delicious ribs lot of places, but I finally had the ribs I've always known were out there somewhere, right here at Smoque. FANTASTIC!
