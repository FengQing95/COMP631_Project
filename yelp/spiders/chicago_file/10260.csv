Art Institute of Chicago////I liked the design and the flow of the various galleries. If it weren't so cold outside for me, I would have explored the sculpture gardens and outdoor spaces, but I was not having any of the wind coming off Lake Michigan! I will definitely go back again (and again); I spent hours soaking up this space and left drunk with delight.
