Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Johnny J is the best waiter I can remember in YEARS.  My husband, daughter, brother-in-law & I had dinner here last night.  It had been many years since any of us had been here - for various reasons - location being one.  My last experience here was 'meh' at best, but I'm sooo glad we gave it another try.  4 people is perfect to be able to order a dozen dishes.  Bacon wrapped dates - sublime, the cheese board was a huge hit - there was really nothing left on any plate as we waddled out of there..  But back to the star of the night - Johnny was friendly and knowledgeable and paced us perfectly.  He has a way with people and I wish him all the success in the world, as I have a suspicion he could be an actor.  If I'm wrong, he's just 1/1,000,000 as a waiter.  BTW, we're old timers who used to go the the prior incarnation at that location - Otto's Beer Garden.
