Art Institute of Chicago////So much amazing art! I thought this was just one building, but it connects to several buildings. I came here 2.5 hours before closing and I couldn't see all the galleries here. I highly recommend coming here and taking the time to visit all the galleries. It's all quite impressive. Oh and American Gothic is located here if you want to check that out!
