Smoque BBQ////Finally got to eat here after wanting to for the longest time. All I can say is wow! I got the brisket sandwich and Mac and cheese. My boyfriend also got the brisket sandwich with beans and everything was just incredible! I didn't want to finish eating! And to top it off the prices are actually really great! Can not wait to eat back at this place asap!
