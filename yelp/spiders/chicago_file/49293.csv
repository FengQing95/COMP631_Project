Smoque BBQ////Also, if you're from UIUC and are trying to compare to Black Dog's, in terms of ribs I still prefer Black Dog's but they give you less meat and they're more expensive compared to Smoque's. As for brisket I only tried a little bit here at Smoque's but I think Smoque's has Black Dog's beat.
