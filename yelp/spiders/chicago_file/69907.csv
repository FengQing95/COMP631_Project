Little Goat Diner////We were seated and our waiter was very friendly and helpful. He was honest in what he liked and didn't like and gave reasonings to why (prefers sweet over savory for breakfast, etc). Our table ordered the reuben, asian breakfast tasty thing, and shrimp & grits. We were beyond impressed with the reuben. It is one of my favorite sandwiches and I'm not sure it's been done better than it is at The Little Goat. The addition of kimchi brought it to a whole new level. Incredible. Now that I'm back in Birmingham, I will continue to try to recreate this sandwich the way it was made here.
