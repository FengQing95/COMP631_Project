Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As a vegetarian, this is always my go-to special occasion restaurant to bring meat-eating friends. The steaks (and bacon) are apparently delicious for them and there's an entire vegetarian menu that I can order from. I also love their Champagne Smash even though they always over-ice it. Speaking of drinks, there's a well-known secret that Bavette's waves the corkage fee on your bottle of wine if you share a glass with another table. We were gifted a glass on our most recent visit. They don't do free birthday desserts or anything like that, but will stick a sparkler in whichever item you order. Kind of a cheap move for a classy place (especially when the average bill is over $200), but to each their own!
