Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Quality of food: we ordered wings and deep dish Pizza.. oh its finger licking.!! No complains, food was received with the expected timeline as it takes time to prepare deep dish pizza.!! A large pan was more than enough and in-fact left over too for 3 people, so be careful of the size you order.
