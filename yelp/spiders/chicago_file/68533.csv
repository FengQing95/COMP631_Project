Little Goat Diner////The Bahn Mi Burger was to die for! Well seasoned beef with a great crunch and subtle spice of the pickled veggies and the sauce...eclectic nouveau 50s diner decor. Great 80s/90s music and attentive service. The chicken pot pie was five star! Light but filling with a tasty crust. Overall, one of the best dinners we've had in Chicago so far!
