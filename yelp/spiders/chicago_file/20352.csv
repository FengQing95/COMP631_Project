Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza is definitely cheesy.  Thanks to the fresh tomatoes, the pizza was moist but somehow the thick crust stood up against all the ingredients well.  Comparing it to Pequod's, it's less sauce but tastes more refreshing, or as refreshing as a deep dish possible could.  The crust is a super flaky buttery crust and yes, you can go for the thin version... but unless you live in Chicago, then just go with the deep dish!
