Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Amazing restaurant. Very nice ambiance. We didn't have a reservation so we had to wait a while to get a table which was understandable but the bartender lady Angie made the wait so much more pleasant. She was so sweet and pretty knowledgeable about the food and drinks that restaurant served. She gave us great recommendations. The steak was really good. We ordered aged rib eye which was pretty tasty. Oh one wonderful thing about this place is you can bring your own bottle of wine and they won't charge you corkage fee as long as you share a little of it with someone. It was pretty cool. Totally recommend this place
