Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been coming here for over 10 years now, even through different ownership, this place has been able to withstand the test of time. The ambiance is cozy, comfortable and chatty - a great place to go on a date or simply to grab a bite with friends. After coming here for so many years there's a standard list of things I always order: Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Alioli, Goat Cheese Baked in Tomato Sauce, Â Roast Dates with Bacon & Apple Vinaigrette, and Chicken & Ham Croquetas. The rest are always fun to try!
