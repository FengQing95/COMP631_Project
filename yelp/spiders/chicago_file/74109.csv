Little Goat Diner////This is the second time I've been to Little Goat for brunch and the second time I've been very pleased and left stuffed and happy.  We ordered fried pickles and onions as an appetizer and when it was delivered to the table, it was only onions.  Turns out the kitchen ran out of pickles but none of the waitstaff knew.  They comped the appetizer which was nice since the fried pickles were what we wanted to try!  I got the sourdough pancakes which were simple but really well done and delicious.  Two people in my party ordered the Fat Elvis waffle which had a HUGE scoop of peanut butter butter on top- they both loved it.  My other friend ordered the pork belly pancake and tempura mashed potatoes.  Tempura mashed potatoes are a genius idea and worth trying.  Little Goat has been packed both times I've gone with a line out the door of people waiting for a table.  Make a reservation if you can or be prepared to wait- it is worth it.
