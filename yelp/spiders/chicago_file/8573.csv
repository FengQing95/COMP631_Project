Art Institute of Chicago////The crowds dissipated as I pressed on and the noise abated allowing for the focus on the treasures that I sought.  Consisting of about 80 works from their collection, these items were rarely displayed to the public due to their sensitivity to light.  It was amazing to be able to be this close to many of the pieces and really look at them to study technique.  The Roy Lichtenstein piece, "Alka Seltzer", was fascinating to view up close and note the pencil lines he drew (but did not erase) to outline where he wanted the glass to be as well as to position the dots that made up the iconic background.
