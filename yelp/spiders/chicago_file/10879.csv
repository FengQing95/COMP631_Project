Art Institute of Chicago////Hmmm....I haven't even fully explored the Art Institute of Chicago, and I am already a fan.  One needs at least a few hours to take in this lovely museum.  Another "Must See" destination in the Windy City!  Hopefully on our next trip here, we can spend more time at this museum.
