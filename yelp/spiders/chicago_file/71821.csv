Little Goat Diner////- Tempura Mashed Potatoes: OMG... their mashed potatoes are so delicious! I'm assuming they also use their garlic mashed potatoes for this dish. And then to cover it with tempura with deep fry it? HEAVEN! The garnish and sauce that came with it gave it just the right balance. If anything, I would come here just to get that small dish.
