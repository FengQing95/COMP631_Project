Little Goat Diner////The coffee is great. The shrimp and grits are even better perfect place to bring out of towners! If you have to wait you can always sit in the cafe bakery that's attached. I also recommend the breakfast clam spaghetti it is too die for. Been here way too many times then I care to admit.
