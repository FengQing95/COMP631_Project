Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cool atmosphere and delicious tapas but service was a little spotty. We ordered 4 tapas (baked goat cheese, mushroom soup, garlic shrimp and grilled hanger steak). We received the steak first, approximately 5 minutes after we ordered it, and it was cold. It must have been sitting out before we ordered, and it just got given to us. Not cool! It was yummy, though, but I wish it was hot. All of our tapas came out quickly, but then we waited 45 minutes before we saw our waiter again to order dessert. He had a lot of tables and the tables around ours were looking for him, too. Strange. Overall a good experience, and I would go back. I just wish the timing of the service was a little better!
