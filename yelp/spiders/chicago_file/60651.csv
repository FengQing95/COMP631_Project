Smoque BBQ////This place is phenomenal.  If you're into smoked and barbecued food, this place is the gold standard since everything on the menu is delicious!  They have red meat, chicken and sausage.  I can't tell which I like more, the taste of the meats or the sauces (I've been caught drinking the sauce!).  The sides are all amazing, each has it's own unique taste, which is compared to no other establishment.  My go-to dish is the sliced brisket sandwich, a side of barbecue beans and a half's of St. Louis ribs.
