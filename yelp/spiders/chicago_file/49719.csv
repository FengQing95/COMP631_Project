Smoque BBQ////Ah, This is a 4.5 star restaurant to me, but I am giving 5 because (first of all they don't have 4.5 officially, but also) their brisket was something special.  It was so tender and juicy but still the texture was intact.  We also loved the St. Louise rib.  However, their baby back rib was dry and just ok.  I would definitely recommend, as a lot of people say, to try briskets and baby back rib.
