Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Just went here for the first time after several years of friends recommending this place. I don't know what took us so long! This spot is fantastic! We had a wonderful server, Tim, who recommended some excellent drinks and tapas. Tim was also so personable and payed great attention to us, he made our experience very enjoyable. I highly recommend the buratta and Brussel sprouts for vegetarians. My husband had the squid and the chorizo wrapped dates and said they were excellent. I also tried the white wine flight and it was suburb. A nice variety. We tried several desserts and they were all delicious, but I have to say the butterscotch custard was our favorite. We only had drinks, tapas and desserts so we will have to come back to try the paella. Highly recommend this spot with it's fun vibe and all around beautiful service!
