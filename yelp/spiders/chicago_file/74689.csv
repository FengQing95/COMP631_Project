Little Goat Diner////BREAKFAST SPAGHETTI 'N CLAMS 'N CRAB - least favorite dish of the place. My gf wanted this since she loves her pasta, but ehhh. Spaghetti, with eggs, clams and crab just sounds weird right? I mean it was very runny. At 1st i wasn't even sure what this dish was because the egg and spaghetti was cooked together so it just looked funky. Wasn't a fan.
