The Purple Pig////The bone marrow came out first with some toasted bread and I have to say that I was a little disappointed.  I was expecting an umame melt-in-your-mouth texture, but that was not the case. I thought that it would spread like butter onto the toast, but that was not the case and it was more like gelatinous  texture that was more like butter that recently came out of the fridge and not left at room temperature.
