Little Goat Diner////Let me start the food off by saying we got there around 11:30 on a weekday and immediately wanted to order the Ooey Gooey Cinnabon, and you just need to believe the menu as you gotta get there early.... they were sold out and we were super sad. But lucky to say, that didn't ruin our experience!
