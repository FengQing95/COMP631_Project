Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Come here if you have a sweet tooth. Â If you don't like sweets or pancakes, then there are probably shorter waits for same/better egg dishes. We had a skillet, an omelette and 2 different types of pancakes and a belgian waffle. You can get so much food at this place as half of the egg orders can allow you to for 1-2 more dollars add in any style of pancakes, crepes, or waffles.
