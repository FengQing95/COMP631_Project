Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Now for the entree... Â Had the classic Chicago ribeye cooked medium and it was perfect, arguably one of the best steaks I ever had, cooked to perfection. It was a full 22oz at about 39 bux. Not too shabby. Wife had he roasted chicken with a side of potatoes and the chicken was blah.
