Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////OH, NO!!!!!! The long-time chef of Cafe BBR left recently and the food is just not the same! I have been a customer of CBBR for years, however it had been about a year since I had been. My husband and I recently stopped in to grab some lunch, and I immediately noticed something drastically changed when I tasted the food. I asked the server why the food tasted different, and she confirmed that there was a new chef.
