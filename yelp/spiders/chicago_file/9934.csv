Art Institute of Chicago////Absolutely amazing! This museum is much larger than it seems, and after about 4 hours of browsing, we realized that there was much more to see. There are 3 floors to this museum but multiple pathways that lead to other buildings with more exhibits. So be sure to wear some comfy shoes!
