Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I tell the waiter I want to move, and then the waiter moves me and says he wants to make my dining experience as good as possible.  I then ask him what's good on the menu.  He is thorough and extremely helpful.  I take the bone-in Ribeye.  My companion takes a Filet mignon.  We share a side of some really fancy corn.  The food is amazing!  The waiter is fantastic and taking care of all of our needs.  My mood brightens.  Suddenly the 20s and 30s music makes sense. I usually could not care less about service, but this waiter rescued the evening.  He was knowledgeable and his recommendations were really good.  The food was delicious.  He recommended a dessert.  It was chocolate cake of some sort, which i am usually not crazy about, but magic waiter dude did it again.  It was a real winner.
