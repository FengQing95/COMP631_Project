Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We arrived around 4:40 - and were pleased to find that the joint was already jumping. After our initial experience at West Loop, we were relieved to see that their bartender was already working - and working hard, shaking up some delicious margaritas. All of the staff we encountered were friendly and welcoming.
