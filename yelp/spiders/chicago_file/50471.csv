Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I almost had to come back in here and write a review on how the USED to be my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Tonight we went there for my birthday (as we always do) and were sat 40 minutes after our 6:00 PM reservation. Around 6:25 PM, I started writing my livid Yelp review in my head. However, once we were finally sat, managers Arther and Brian apologized profusely and explained the situation. I completely appreciated the explanation because it made total sense. They brought us two free tapas. The first unknowingly being my favorite, the goat cheese and marinara, which I would have ordered anyway. Our server, Erika, took good care of us. Overall, the wait was completely made up to us. Cafe Ba-ba-reeba is still my favorite restaurant in Chicago.
