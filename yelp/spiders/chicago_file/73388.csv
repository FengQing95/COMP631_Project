Little Goat Diner////With my friends from California here for a weekend, I wanted to make sure they got a good taste of all the great food that Chicago has to offer. Thus Little Goat Diner made it onto our itinerary filled with some of the more iconic Chicago eats since Girl and the Goat had so much hype but it was difficult to get my large group a reservation there.
