Smoque BBQ////Go to this place for the barbecue chicken... Stay for the brisket... And the macaroni and cheese... Okay, the bread pudding is pretty freaking awesome too. What I'm trying to say is... You better be real hungry when you go to this place. The restaurant feels kind of like a school cafeteria. But, that's where the similarities end. I promise, your lunchroom never had tender brisket like this. If it did, you would have failed every class you could... Just so that you can spend more time there. Yeah, it's that kind of good.
