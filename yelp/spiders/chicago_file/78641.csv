Little Goat Diner////I had planned to visit Little Goat Diner on my recent trip to Chicago because I wanted to visit at least one of Chef Stephanie Izard's restaurants while I was in town. I was bummed when on my last day I noticed that apple maps said it was closed, but decided to still head that way and at least check out the bakery next door. To my surprise the restaurant was opened (and we requested that Apple update their hours for the business). At this point my expectations are HIGH and let me tell you, Little Goat did NOT dissapoint.
