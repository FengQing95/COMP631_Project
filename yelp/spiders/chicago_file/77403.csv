Little Goat Diner////For appetizers, we had Pork belly home fries. I love those pickled banana peppers. This a must try! My husband ordered an old fashion together with his pork torta, the serving of the yucatan pork was very generous. my little one saw another kid eating pancakes so she ordered the same.
