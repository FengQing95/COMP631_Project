Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Their pizza (both thin and deep dish) is one of the best in the city- and the crust on their pizza may be one of the best I've had in the world.  I start to drool just thinking about it.  The pizza always the right ratio of sauce to cheese to toppings creating pure bliss with every bite.
