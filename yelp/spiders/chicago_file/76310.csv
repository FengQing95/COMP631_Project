Little Goat Diner////Amazing brunch experience after church. We had a short 20 min wait before our private table was ready. Jillian is so kind and has so much energy. I appreciate her patience in explaining some of the meals and helping me make a decision. I had the Bulls Eye French toast. Mostly because my friend couldn't stop raving about how good it was and I wasn't feeling super adventurous.
