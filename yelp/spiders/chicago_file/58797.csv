Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Food: Some of the entrees were slightly salty to my taste; nothing a bit of cocktail couldn't take care of. Tomato bread was a bit soggy when it came out, would have preferred it to have a crispy layer. Overall, every dish had very good flavor, but had a small little something that I thought could be improved. The tapas flowed very well into each other; and the paella was delightful at the end. I walked away very full.
