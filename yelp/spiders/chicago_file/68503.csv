Little Goat Diner////Awesome upscale diner that is totally worth the hype and the wait. Definitely plan far ahead or opt for an early lunch if you don't want to spend the better part of 2 hours here, but honestly there are far worse fates. The bar/bakery in the back is a nice place to hang out while you wait for a table in the main area.
