Little Goat Diner////Service was the big problem here, at least at 6 PM at the counter on a Sunday night.  Our waitress poured us glasses of water, then disappeared for 15 minutes while we twiddled our thumbs waiting to order.  Finally flagged down another server to find ours, then waited some more.  When our server eventually re-appeared, a, "Sorry for the wait, folks, what can I get you?" would have gone a long way, but instead, she just casually asked, "Are you ready to order?" with no indication that she was aware that that yes, we were pretty much ready to order 15 minutes earlier.
