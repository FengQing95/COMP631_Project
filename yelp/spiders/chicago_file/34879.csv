Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Best lamb I have ever had. Cooked to perfection. I had the lamb T-bone w/buttered mushrooms and my fianc√© had the Chicago style rib-eye w/bone marrow. Can't forget the thick cut bacon....you can't miss that. When I come back to Chicago I will definitely repeat this place. The service is also exceptional.
