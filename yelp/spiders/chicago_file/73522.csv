Little Goat Diner////We were a party of two, but even then we were quoted a 45 minute wait (a group of four that went in after us said they were told to expect an hour-and-fifteen-minute wait!) on a Saturday around noon. It was just starting to get slightly chilly last weekend, but not too bad, so we decided we were dressed warmly enough to take a seat outside instead of waiting. In retrospect, I'm really happy we ate outside. It was beautiful outside, and quiet compared to inside. The restaurant itself was SO LOUD (yes, I'm shouting!) and packed (tables very close to each other), inside that I doubt we'd be able to hear each other very well, let alone have the great conversations we had outside.
