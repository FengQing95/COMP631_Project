Little Goat Diner////Can't believe it took us this long to get here. Anyways went here yesterday evening for dinner. We've been to girl & the goat couple years ago- Stephanie Izard knows what she's doing. This place has that diner type feel except with an upscale twist. We sat at the diner table facing the kitchen. Server gave us some great recommendations: the bread of the day was coffee blueberry, I did the greek town chicken salad and husband did the pork chop. Amazing! Special pie at the moment was a passion fruit pie with Oreo crust. If that's on the menu when you go-GET IT. You'll thank me.
