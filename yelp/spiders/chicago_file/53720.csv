Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Patatas bravas are hot and crispy on the outside but tender on the inside, aioli is perfect (not spicy for my taste.). Goat cheese in tomato sauce is served with buttered toast. Complimentary bread is sliced fresh with a soft inside and crisp crust. Pan con tomate is crisp bread with the perfect amount of tomato but could've used more garlic in my opinion. Shrimp (gambas al ajillo) in olive oil and garlic with red pepper flakes was my favorite. Dip your bread in it! Â Seafood paella was just ok but nice that they sub chicken for monkfish. Rioja short rib was delish. Would NOT rec tortilla espanola, although it came out piping hot it was like a round hash brown that was soggy? Calamari was usual.
