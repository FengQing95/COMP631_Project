Little Goat Diner////So then, after the longest, most painful decision process ever, we ordered dinner. Not that we were still hungry or anything... Â My colleague got this massive burger with mushrooms and homemade cheese sauce. I think that speaks for itself, but hot damn. So good. I got myself the Boo Boo Baise, minus the mussels. Drooling now just thinking about it.
