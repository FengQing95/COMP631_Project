Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We started off with the bacon wrapped dates, spicy potatoes, goat cheese and short ribs and put in the order for the pork paella. All the tapas were delicious! The short ribs melted in our mouths! When the paella came, it looked a bit burnt but we decided not to say anything. As soon as we started eating, we could definitely taste the burnt rice that were super crunchy and the meats were bitter. I'm not the type of person to send the food back but it was my boyfriend's first time trying tapas and I wasn't gonna let him have this paella! It was already 11:00pm and when the server came we explained the situation. He looked at the paella and was very accommodating on taking it back and offered to whip up another serving. We were already tired and opted for two different tapas - seared spanish sausage and beef skewers. Sausages were on point, but the beef skewer was also very burnt and tasted bitter.
