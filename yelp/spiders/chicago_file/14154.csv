Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It was decent Chicago-style pizza. Does not measure up to Giordanos or Uno, but i like deep dish (ie really thick crust) pizza. It is more like Chicago-style pizza that you would get in other cities. The filling is a little soggy. You will wait an hour on average for a table. The salads are great - recommend the Malnotti salad. Waitstaff are very friendly.
