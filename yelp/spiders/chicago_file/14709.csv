Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time experiencing Deep Dish in Chicago and it was really delicious. The server was really helpful to all of us Wisconsinites that needed a bit of help picking the best pizza. He told us about their specials and even brought out a dessert for my friend's birthday without us requesting it. I definitely recommend for a group or just for a dinner. Pizza is greasy but it is sooooo worth it. Just go for a walk in the city and you will feel much better after!
