Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is one of the best steakhouse experiences ever!  And I love steakhouses.  I have been to many amazing places.  Not only were the steaks fabulous, but every side and salad and cocktail was excellent also.  The vibe is unlike a normals Steakhouse.  It feels more like a trendy speakeasy.  I would go here to just hang out for drinks also.  But the food was amazing!!!
