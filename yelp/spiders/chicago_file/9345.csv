Art Institute of Chicago////I'm now in my third year of becoming a member (not that expensive, great gift idea, and it allows guests in for free). I really enjoy seeing something new each time, taking friends here and showing off how this amazing museum to everyone I can. From 500 BC to today, pots to photography, and armor to Asian figurines, there's something here for everyone.
