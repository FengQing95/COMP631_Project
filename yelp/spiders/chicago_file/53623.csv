Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I totally love this place! The decor and vibe are amazing and upbeat, the sangria is completely perfect and the food is just amazing! Â I went here with a bunch of vegetarians and all we ate were patatas bravas and that cheese and tomato sauce dish - whatever that's called. Please don't ever do that to yourself here! Enjoy the octopus and lamb and all of the other foods on the menu. This is not a place to deprive yourself of the full menu!
