Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Corn Elote: I think it was too creamy compared to what I like in a corn elote- was like a creamed corn meats corn elote. There was nothing that brightened the dish up, and we were hoping for something light to bring balance to an overall very decadent dinner. This was also served a la carte in a decent sized portion, but was still extremely expensive for corn (don't remember exactly how much).
