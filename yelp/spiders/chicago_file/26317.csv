Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////me and my friend ordered a small. came with 4 slices, we added jalapenos and it was really good! we have a gino's in texas and we ordered one and im sure its frozen thats why it takes so long. but still. it wasnt as good as lou's, idk if its frozen but it was really good very different from what i had at gino's. i wanted to eat it with my hands. i could wait for the cutting hahaha. thats how good it was. we were only able to finish the 2 slices, and the pasta, so we were left with 2 slices, that we took home to texas and ate right when we got home. it was still good! i put it in the oven for about 40 min and it wasnt as hot as it was when served, so i can def see why it takes 45min for a pizza to come out. its a really big pie.
