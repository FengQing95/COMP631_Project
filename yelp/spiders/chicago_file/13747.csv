Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////this place is AMAZING. We were in Chicago for three days and we went once on a Friday and again on a Saturday. On Friday, we got there at around 6 and the wait was 15 minutes. On Saturday, we got there at 4 and the wait was an hour. The pizza is so good but the cookie and ice cream dessert was my favorite part. Hands down the best ice cream I've ever had. When we went on Saturday, the cooks didn't make the dessert at the same time as our appetizers like we asked, so the manager gave us the desserts on the house. The food is great, the staff is nice, and it's in a good location.
