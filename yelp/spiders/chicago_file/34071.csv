Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've been working my way down through 30 of Yelp's ranking of the top craft cocktail bars in Chicago. Three had stood out spectacularly: Violet Hour, Maude's and Whistler. After visiting Bavette's this last weekend, I have another on the list. And two blocks from where I live, no less.
