Smoque BBQ////wow, some of these comments are pretty false, i had to speak up. i live in socal now and still dream of smoque. best brisket! best mac and cheese! and please make room for that peach cobbler... i've been to a lot of bbq spots and smoque blew my mind. yes, there is a wait but its BYOB, take advantage of that, the awesome BBQ, and the awsome company you bring to eat with you. we love smoque so much, hubby will be ordering catering from them for my birthday =)
