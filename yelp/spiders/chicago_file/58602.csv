Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Just finished brunch here. Tried a number of different items and unfortunately was very unimpressed with the flavor of everything. Got the avocado toast and you could tell the avocado was not fresh - when the waitress came back she stated that "well we make it with lime and that might be it". Big fan of lime in my avocado - along with other things but you can tell when an avocado is fresh. The waitress pretty much avoided us the rest of the time we were there. Overall disappointed. I literally never review places but feel like I needed to. Blah.
