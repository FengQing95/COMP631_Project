Art Institute of Chicago////Unlike most museums, you can take pictures, without flash of course, since it's a good way to remember everything. If you're like me, my short-term memory really... well, stays short-term memory. Picasso, Van Gogh, Monet, the list of famous artists is endless. It's great being to able to see a painting that you recognize in the books or on television, and have it hanging in front of your nose. The perfect example -- American Gothic. Heck, there's a huge sculpture of it sitting right on Michigan Ave.
