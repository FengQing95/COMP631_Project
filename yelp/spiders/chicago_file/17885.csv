Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I believe they started it all. It had to be Lou, Gino's or Unos. Lou is my favorite of the bunch. Gino's East was amazing back in the day. Uno's was incredible. But Lou? Addictive. I would wake up in the middle of the night craving more of the butter crust. I've been told that I make a pretty mean pizza and I have to say I cribbed a few tips from Lou. I would eat there more often but I have to get some sleep at night, I can't afford to wake up craving crust.
