Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Oh my heavens. Twice I've been through Chicago and twice I went to Lou Malnati's. They were different locations but amazing all the same. The first time I went I got the famous deep dish, and it was pretty good but what amazed me more was the cheese bread I got. A small loaf filled with cheese and spinach. The second time I decided to go with the thin crust and ding, ding, ding! we have a winner! Wish I had one of these around the corner from me in California cause they would get a lot more business!
