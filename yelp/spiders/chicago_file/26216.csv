Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Strangely I've found that a lot of Chicago locals don't seem to be fans of deep dish pizza, but personally I love it. Sure, it's super heavy and you can only really get through a couple slices before wanting to die, but how can you not love that much cheese and dough on one plate?
