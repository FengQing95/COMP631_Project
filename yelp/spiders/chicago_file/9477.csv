Art Institute of Chicago////This is truly an extraordinary museum - as with many of the world's great art museums, make sure that you have scheduled yourself at least one WHOLE day for your visit, since you will barely be able to get through the museum in this short time... I greatly enjoyed the Lichtenstein traveling exhibit during my tour, but it appears as if they have a "Picasso and Chicago" exhibit now - how sad. (That's extremely tongue in cheek... How fantastic!)
