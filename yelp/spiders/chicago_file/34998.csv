Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For entrees, my wife went with the steak frites and I had the Chicago cut ribeye. Hers was excellent. Love that they use a flatiron cut, and it was beefy and cooked to medium rare perfection. The frites were equally awesome. My steak was tough, flavorless, and overcooked. I should have sent it back, but I didn't. Major letdown.
