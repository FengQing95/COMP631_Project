Smoque BBQ////We ordered a full rack of Baby Back ribs, added on a side of chopped brisket. For sides - cole slaw, mac&cheese & corn bread.  We topped it off with Pecan bread pudding.  Plus, we got two drinks to wash everything down. It was A LOT of food for less than $40.  By the way, this place is BYOB.
