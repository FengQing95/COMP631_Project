Little Goat Diner////At breakfast on a Saturday, I saw Rahm which I guess is remotely cool. Anyway -- we waited about 40 min from 10am to 11ish... The coffee and bar and bakery in the back is pretty handy while you wait. I had the shrimp and grits which were pretty good. Honestly not much to say about them. Tasty and everything was cooked right.
