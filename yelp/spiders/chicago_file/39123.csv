Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////After finishing our entrees, we were both pretty fully, and boxed up 1/2 of our portions to take home.  We decided not to order anything for dessert, however our waiter gave us a complimentary whiskey infused ice cream that came out with a sparkler on top.  The ice cream was really rich and creamy, and very very sweet.
