The Purple Pig////Also, I'm not sure if it was just our table, but the service was pretty brisk for it being a pricier restaurant. Is shoving aside plates and water glasses upon bringing a new dish typical? At least the guy refilling water smiled. Not basing this review on the service, but it would be a 3 or maybe even a 2/5 when I look at our meal's bill.
