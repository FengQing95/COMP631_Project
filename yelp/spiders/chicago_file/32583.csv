Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My favorite place in eat, drink and celebrate a special occasion in Chicago for the last year. THE BEST DRY AGED BONE IN RIBEYE I HAVE HAD in CHICAGO. Even though they are not  a "Classic Chicago steakhouse"  Same goes for their oysters not being a "Chicago Seafood Staple" I leave full happy, satisfied and wanting to come back for more. Their fresh baked bread is so bomb. Bone marrow, cocktails and ambiance is spot on. MUST TRY for locals and tourists.  Menu lets you share and spend little $$ or celebrate, go all out and spend $$$$. All of their spot are great but this is my favorite so far. Keep doing what you doing!
