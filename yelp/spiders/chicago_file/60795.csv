Smoque BBQ////Once we got our food...heaven! The baby back ribs were meaty and the rub is absolutely to die for. They didn't even need any BBQ which I never say about ribs. I got the BBQ beans and mac and cheese for sides. None were disappointing. The baked beans were hearty and though I like a tad more heat, these were definitely a highlight of the meal. Bust into the mac and cheese early when it is hot for the best result. The crunchy topping was the perfect accompaniment. My honey's sliced brisket was good too, though he admitted my ribs were better. Â :)
