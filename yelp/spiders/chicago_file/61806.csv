Smoque BBQ////I have traveled all around the country and have made it a point to stop at local cafes, BBQ restaurants, and other places to eat.  This is a must stop and eat. I ordered pretty much everything on the menu and between 6 of us we ate it all. Amazing BBQ.  The brisket is the real deal. I will eat here tons more time in life.
