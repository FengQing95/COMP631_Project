Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm new to Chicago and in search of a new favorite pizza joint.  I think I'm in love on my second try....the first place (also a big Chicago name) I did not care for.  Malnati's sauce is excellent and overall a great flavor.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that the crust (which I love, incidentally) has a buttery taste to it.  The staff confirmed that they do use butter in the crust, and while it tastes great, I really don't need the extra calories.
