Little Goat Diner////This chic diner is perfect for basic bitches like myself. The interior is decorated just like a diner, but with a clean, modern twist. There are huge, comically round low intensity light bulbs hanging everywhere. Towards one end there's a large counter where you can see all of the commotion going on in the kitchen. Fat mirror columns add more natural light to the restaurant on a cloudy day such as when we visited, and not-your-grandma's flower patterned wallpaper gives the whole place a girly, Instagram-worthy touch. There's also a rooftop!
