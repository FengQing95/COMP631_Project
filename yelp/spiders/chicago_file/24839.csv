Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The Malnati Chicago Classic: Worth the wait! The sauce was perfect and didn't have that prominent acidic flavor. Not being a fan of sausage toppings on my pizza, I digged the sausage on ours. The cheese was nice and stringy, and the garlic Buttercrust was perfect and not hard to bite into. Â
