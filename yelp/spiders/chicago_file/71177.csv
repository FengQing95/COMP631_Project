Little Goat Diner////This place is amazing. Great cocktails, unique diner menu, awesome service. I came here with a large group very late on a Wednesday and our server was perfect. He gave great suggestions and accommodated everyone's requests. He also gave us an extra dessert on the house! I love that they serve breakfast all day. I had the breakfast burrito and was able to try some of my friends dishes. Everything was outstanding. The desserts are good too. I will definitely be back!
