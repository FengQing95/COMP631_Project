Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////When my dining companions not-so-guiltily ordered a gilded dinner (that means they ordered a triple-digit seafood tower), I almost capitulated to peer pressure and ordered Bavette's signature bone-in ribeye, almost violating my rule above. A cooler head prevailed, and I stuck with the steak frites for a much more optimal price. I'm glad I did. Bavette's is a 7 oz skirt, and in combination with a hearty spread of apps and sides, it's plenty. Plenty delicious. For me, it's a tossup between that and Topolobampo's mole carne asada for best piece of Chicago beef that's partied in my mouth. I can't recommend it enough.
