Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We were treated like royalty when I came here with my fiancé for our anniversary. Service, friendliness, ambiance, and above all food, were 10 stars. While this restaurant is expensive, it was worth every penny, and you do indeed get what you pay for here. We were greeted by a pleasant, friendly staff and seated at the exact table we requested when we arrived. The servers and maître d' all wished us happy anniversary (which they knew when I call days earlier for the reservation), which was very nice. The comfortable booth seating, lighting and noise level are perfect for a romantic date, or potentially even for a professional business meeting. The food was out of this world. I had the 42 day dry aged bone-in ribeye steak, literally the best steak I've ever had in my life. Perfectly seared on the outside with delicious crispy pepper and salt seasoning, and cooked in the middle to medium rare perfection. The delicious marbling on the steak gave it an amazing melt in your mouth experience. Words can't fully describe the experience, other than they must serve this steak in heaven. To wrap it up, they surprised us with a sparkling candle ice cream sundae at the end and wished us a happy anniversary. We had a great experience and will absolutely recommend and come back ourselves.
