Art Institute of Chicago////My husband and I experienced extreme racism at this museum by an attendant and her supervisor in the Impressionism gallery. My husband brought in a gimbal to hold his iPhone to make accurate and straight photos. We were ok'd at the door to enter the museum. The attendant rudely screamed at us that it's not allowed and proceeded to follow us around. We asked her to call her supervisor, she took nearly 10 minutes to show up. My husband walked away and I followed from another gallery only to walk up on a conversation about " white b****** think they entitled ". I confronted her and she was speechless. This was one of the rudest things Ive ever experienced, I was looking forward to this museum, however now I have a sour taste over what happened.
