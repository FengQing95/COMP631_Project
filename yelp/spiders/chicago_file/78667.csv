Little Goat Diner////- Bull's eyes French Toast (4/5): 2 eggs, French toasts drizzled with maple syrup, strawberries and chopped fried chicken. Ordered this thanks to our waiter. Eggs are actually nested in the middle of the toasts. Bread is airy buttery with the right amount of syrup (not soaked). Fried chickens are tasty but typical. Fresh strawberries! Great if you want a sweet savory meal.
