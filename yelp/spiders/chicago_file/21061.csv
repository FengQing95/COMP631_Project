Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our lackluster experience with Lou Malnati's started the second we put our name with the hostess.  She was not friendly when we put our name in and did not want to answer any of the questions we had.   We were told we would have about a 45 minute wait and would get a text when our table was ready.  We went to Bull and Bear next door for a drink and about 25 minutes later we got a text that our table was ready at Lou's.
