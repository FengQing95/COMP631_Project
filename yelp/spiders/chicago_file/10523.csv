Art Institute of Chicago////My main "issue" is that there is just sooooooo much European art. I wish they had larger sections on art around the world. The American folk art section was tiny. Sure there are large rooms of some different cultures but then there are rooms and rooms and rooms of old art made by white European males. I just don't find this art super interesting, I like seeing the different kind of art made by different people all around the world, as much as the "famous" stuff. I know this is probably an unpopular opinion, but that's why I gave this a 4 out of 5.
