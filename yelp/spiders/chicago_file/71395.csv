Little Goat Diner////A twist on diner food and a variation to Stephanie Izard's famous Little Girl and the Goat restaurant down the street, this place is a fun adaption to American cuisine. Â Unlike it's sister restaurant, expect the food here to be big, and by that, I mean the portion. It would be wise to share. Try a little of everything; it's hard to go wrong.
