Little Goat Diner////I had the patty melt and goat chilli cheese fries. Both looked great and tasted great but as mentioned above, was incredibly salty. I couldn't finish my meal on this occasion but I've heard great things about this place and will definitely come back to see if this was just an off night for them. I refuse to believe that so many people were wrong about this place being great lol!
