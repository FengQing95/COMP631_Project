Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////As for the deserts and drinks...AMAZING! I think we ordered everything off the desert menu but my favorite was definitely the butterscotch item! The drink choices were great as well. We ordered twp types of sangaria, the white and the blood orange sangaria (which was on special). Both were very tasty but definitely lacked the alcoholic kick you'd expect from sangaria.
