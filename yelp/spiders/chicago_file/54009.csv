Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Fun environment and surprisingly large restaurant, have been here a few times always busy but not overwhelming. Definitely recommend reservations on weekends as the wait can be lengthy, but if you are just a couple, there are two bars which you can typically slide right into and eat at the bar. The tapas are very filling(which isn't always the case with tapas) and priced reasonably, I always plan on getting the paella but end up too full from tapas! Â and I'm always a fan of a place that offers wine flights- the sangria is amazing too! Also close to other bars if you do have a wait!
