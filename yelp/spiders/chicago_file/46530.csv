Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This past trip was the first time that I had sampled the desserts thanks to a free gift with yelp check in. Thanks yelp! We all LOVED the dessert. DO NOT MISS THIS! The desserts are small bites, so you can find room after stuffing yourself with the tapas. Â I didn't think that a caramelized banana could be improved upon, but Babareeba's banana dessert is fantastic. The hard sugary topping is a nice touch. The Butterscotch pudding was definately worth a taste, but it is very rich. Everyone loved the Chocolate truffle, no one needed more than a bite....it was that satisfying and dense.
