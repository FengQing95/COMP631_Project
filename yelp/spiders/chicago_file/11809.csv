Art Institute of Chicago////A true beauty of a museum and extremely well curated. Free for Illinois residents on Thursdays at 5:00pm-8:00pm. We walked to the ticket line at 5:45pm. The staff member asked just my husband for our zip code. We were then given our complimentary tickets, just like that. We were then free to venture three floors of artifacts, sculptures, paintings, and other artworks.
