Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////They have a very large menu, but here are my favorites:  the paella (although it takes a while to prepare, it's well worth the wait), the bacon wrapped dates (delicious!!!), the patatas bravas with an amazing dipping sauce, the goat cheese croquetas, and the gambas al ajillo.  For dessert: the butterscotch. It's awesome!!
