Smoque BBQ////We opted for sandwiches. I had the chopped brisket and the husband had the 1/2 and 1/2, which is half chopped and half sliced. I ate about half of mine, which he happily finished. The Â  macaroni and cheese is awesome - creamy with sharp cheddar and a nice sprinkling of toasted breadcrumbs on top. The coleslaw was good, but not fantastic, especially in comparison to everything else.
