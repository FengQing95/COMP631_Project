Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Despite, not being a huge fan of the location.  This place is pretty good.  I especially enjoyed the papaya, stuffed mushrooms, and the pappas w/ chipotle mayo.  It's good for groups on weeknights.  Beer was a little pricier than I hoped for.  You should probably just go ahead and get some sangria there.
