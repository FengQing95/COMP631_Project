Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food here isn't the best Spanish food I've ever had but damn does it give the authentic stuff a run for its money. I came here for the PJ brunch on New Year's Day. It was fabulous, you get to wear your PJs and they give you a gift card with a value of what you spend on brunch. Their brunch is fabulous, the potato croquets are outstanding and the perfect drunk food. The hash brown eggs benedict is outstanding as well, and I'm quite well versed in eggs benedicts in this city. The chicken sausage wasn't amazing, but I'm not a huge fan of sausage to begin with. Their sangria is probably the best in the city in my opinion. I know this place is also good for groups which is a huge bonus for the Lincoln Park area. I love that this place is in my hood and I'm looking forward to some paella!
