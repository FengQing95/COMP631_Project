Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Obviously there are flaws. If we didn't order enough food, then it would be a pain to get more pizza. There didn't seem to be a convenient elevator nearby and I had sprained my knee, so the stairs were a bit brutal for me. The plates on the table seemed to have some food on it, which looks like transfer from dirty plate onto a wet but clean plate. The staff took it away and gave me a new one, and I have no idea if they just wiped it down and gave back the same plate. But I've eaten in some sketchy places in Asia and Africa, so this was still ok for me.
