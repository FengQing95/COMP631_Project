Little Goat Diner////One of our favorite West loop spots! Since moving to the area just over 2 yrs ago, my partner and I have eaten at little goat at least once a month. The upscale diner concept offers a plethora of delicious eats, great craft cocktails, and a nice beer selection in a lively atmosphere. We love it!
