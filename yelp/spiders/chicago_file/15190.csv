Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As far as the deep dish goes- the cheese was plentiful, the sauce was amazing and the buttercrust was just ok. Maybe it was just too much bread for my liking but the ingredients are what really did this pie justice for me - the taste all together was incredible.  We split a small deep dish and I think it was great for sharing between two people.  The couple next to us ordered the next size up and took plenty of leftover slices to go.
