Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It was sooooo busy when we arrived on July 1st, but we were in this for the long haul and hoping for the best. The BEST is what we got! We checked in, we were told it would be about a hour or more but we could order our food and it would be almost ready when we were seated. . . . PERFECT! We ordered, went a few doors down for a drink, and returned when we were texted. The pizza arrived approximately 30 minutes later and did not disappoint. I am currently doing the keto diet and their crustless pizza was on point! Sausage used as the crust and delicious topping throughout, highly recommend if you aren't eating bread. Just because I'm weak, I also tried the deep dish we ordered. Â . . . OMG, so amazing. The crust, the sausage, the sauce, it works so well together.
