Little Goat Diner////I love this place! I've been a few times and everytime has been a hit. I took a friend who doesnt really care where he eats and he was blown away at how good a simple patty melt can be. he said "your just going to order avocado toast?" and what showed up was homeade bread covered in avocado and all kinds of other goodness. Wasn't "just" avocado toast. She has quite a few vegan options, make sure to ask for a menu, including a shake, I believe, but im always too full to indugle in the sweets.
