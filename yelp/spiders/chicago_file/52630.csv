Smoque BBQ////I recently realized how much I love BBQ so I knew I had to check out Smoque. It was kind of a hike to get out there but it was totally worth it. Best pulled pork I have ever had, great fries, great St. Louis ribs. Reasonable price and BYOB. No complaints except location and maybe sauce variety. I tried Chicago Q, and there was really no comparison. This place is a BBQ must.
