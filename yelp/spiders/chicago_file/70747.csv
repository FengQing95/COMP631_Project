Little Goat Diner////Our waitress while extremely nice did seem quite busy. However, our water glasses were never empty for long or anything. We wanted to try the goat chili cheese fries but she said they had already run out for the day (must be some seriously delicious chili if that's the case). We wound up ordering fried pickles and onions instead as an app. I really loved how hot the appetizer was and how light-tasting the batter was. The two sauces they had with it (tartar, maybe, and some house-made mustard which was SUPER mild) went really well with the pickles and onions. I especially appreciated that they pickled the onions too because I am not a huge huge fan of onion rings. There was a lot of acidity going on in that app though, so if that's not your thing, don't order it.
