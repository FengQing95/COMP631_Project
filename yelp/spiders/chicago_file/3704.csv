The Purple Pig////We started with the **Salt-roasted Beets served with whipped goat cheese & pistachio vinaigrette. I never liked beets until the day i visited purple pig. It was freaken delicious. Now I'm all about beets. **Roasted Bone Marrow with Herb Salad & Sicilian Sea Salt was really good. Very tasty! **Pork Neck Bone Gravy With Ricotta was such a good spread for bread. So much flavor. So yummy!
