Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here with my best friend and her parents! The tapas were great!! the paella was ok. I thought it was a little bland, ended up adding the patatas bravas sauce to it to spice it up. It was perfect for a big group of people gathering since it can be family style. I would go back for the Patatas Bravas alone!
