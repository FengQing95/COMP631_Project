Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place definitely lives up to the rating. The bar area was first come first serve and full service which worked great for us, since we hadn't made reservations. Started with the warm fresh made sourdough bread with some of the creamiest butter I've ever had. Followed by the avocado stuffed salad, was airy and light, with the perfect pairing of flavors. Finished the night with the 6oz filet which melted in your mouth and the Mac & Cheese which was to die for. We had debated for a while to do the Mac vs the Mashed Potatoes, and of course because the service is so phenomenal they brought us both, with the Mashed being on the house. Our server Alicia could not have been more perfect. She was attentive, knowledgeable about the menu, and a delight to chat with. 10/10 would recommend.
