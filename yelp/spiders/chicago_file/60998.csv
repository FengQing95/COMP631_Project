Smoque BBQ////And FYI, the wait in the line is pretty sporadic. You go into line to order your food; then pick it up when they call your number like a good o'le bbq joint. When I got there, I was at the tail of the line that went straight to the door. But once I got my food, I sadly watched the line dwindle to 3-4 people to reach the all holy cashier.
