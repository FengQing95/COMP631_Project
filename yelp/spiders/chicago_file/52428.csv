Smoque BBQ////There are no short of 5 star reviews, yet I want to add mine. Been there twice, very impressed with the efficiency of the operation, everything runs so smoothly; staff are super nice. Noticed that when they got the table ready for us, they even cleaned the high chair for the baby. Then when we left our iPhone there by accident, the guy chased us down the block to return it. Great food great people!
