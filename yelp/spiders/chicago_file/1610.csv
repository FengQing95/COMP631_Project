Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This place was definitely worth the wait.  It's located right next to the bean in Millennium Park and their breakfast is the big draw.  We had about 10 people in our party and not a single complaint on the food, service, or portion size.  I had the rancher's skillet with tons of eggs, potatoes, bacon, and mounds of cheddar cheese.  It was fantastic.  Most of the kids had some crazy ass pancakes that looked like dessert.  It was incredible.  Cookie crumbles, whipcream, chocolate.  Nothing but smiles all around.  It was a wee crowded but I suppose that's the sign of a great place.  We'd definitely go back.
