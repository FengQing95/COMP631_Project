Art Institute of Chicago////A trip to Chicago can not be complete without visiting the famous Art Institute. This has become one of my favorite museums, surpassing the Met in NY. I love the fact that it has a little bit of something for everyone, from medieval artifacts to European paintings to Chinese porcelain to photography to contemporary art. While the place is huge, it feels comfortable and manageable to spend an entire day here to check out most of the exhibits. Â
