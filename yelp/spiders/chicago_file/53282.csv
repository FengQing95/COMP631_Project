Smoque BBQ////I had the sliced brisket platter with cornbread and baked beans, and also shared  the 1/2 & 1/2 rib platter with mac & cheese and fries.  I love brisket, and this wasn't as good as what I like (not as tender and soft), but it was tastiest as I've had in Chicago.  The ribs were good -- the baby backs are smaller than the St. Louis style but meatier, and both had nice flavor.  The baked mac & cheese was awesome!  The fries are a huge portion too, and surprisingly good; they're the thick-cut, skin-on fries.  The cornbread was good (can't really mess it up), and the baked beans had some meat in it, so I liked that touch.  I probably wouldn't get the brisket again, but I would get the ribs again and would try the chicken and sausage sometime.
