Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is pretty hopping for a Monday night!  Been meaning to try this place for a while now.   The fried calamari was good, but the grilled squid with olive oil & garlic was even better.  That was one of the best dishes of the night.  The warm pork belly and caramelized onion gratin dip was so-so and fell short of expectations.  Beef tenderloin & blue cheese was pretty salty but the chips on the side helped balance it all out (surprised it was only tiny pieces though).  Escargot croquetas were good if you're ready for some uber-richness.  One or two was enough for me and happy to be splitting that one.  It had some rich buttery  filling inside along w/ the escargot.  Spicy potatoes with tamato alioli was above average.  Definitely had a little bit to it.  Their version of garlic potato salad isn't as garlicky as i had hoped.  Overall, the food was average but the service/atmosphere was good for relaxing and catching up with friends.
