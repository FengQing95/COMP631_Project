Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This may not make everyone's best of Chicago steak list, but it makes mine.  The atmosphere offers a sort of throw-back, 1920s prohibition-era feel.  I can't think of a dining experience that I received better service than the waitstaff here.  Our waiter was attentive to every detail and was more knowledgeable about the menu than 90% of his colleagues elsewhere.  I will without a doubt re-patronize Bavette's.
