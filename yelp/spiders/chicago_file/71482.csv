Little Goat Diner////Cool vibe. Noisy but our table of six managed conversation with someone who has hearing problems. The service was excellent. Everyone enjoyed their food and the portions were generous. I had half an order of biscuits and gravy. Flakey golden biscuit smothered in a delicious mushroom gravy. Then I had lemon coconut cake. Meh. I should have passed. The frosting tasted like unsalted butter and there was hardly and coconut flavor. Sprinkling toasted coconut in the whipped cream alongside the cake doesn't make for a "lemon coconut cake." It wasn't worth the price. I should have had a larger entree and skipped it. But I'd go back again.
