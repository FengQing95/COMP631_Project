The Purple Pig////Scene/Service: It was super packed with a long wait on a weeknight at dinner time, but I was rescued by an amazing server who saw me standing alone scouting out the bar for an open seat. She asked my name and escorted me to the best seat in the house- right in front of the open kitchen. Seems they reserve these 4 stools for solo diners as she kept filling them with singles as the seats turned over. I literally cannot say enough about this sweet server who remembered my name, kept checking in, made brilliant recommendations, never made me feel rushed. The crew in the kitchen is really impressive firing out dishes at a speed you can't imagine, but with amazing attention to detail. I saw the restaurant expediter send one order of bone marrow back twice because it didn't meet his standard for presentation and he carefully checked to make sure grilled bread was at the perfect temp and soft-cooked eggs the right level of doneness. 5 star staff for sure!
