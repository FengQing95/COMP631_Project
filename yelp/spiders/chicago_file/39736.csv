Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It has been a couple of years since my last visit but just as great as I remember it. This place deserves to be in the same conversation as all the great steakhouses in Chicago and would be in my top 3.  I had the classic Rib Eye, which was outstanding and a perfect medium rare.  We also loved the sour dough bread so much they we requested a second order and our waitress was so kind to pack a couple of slices to-go at the end of our meal. Great service, great food - will definitely be back again soon.
