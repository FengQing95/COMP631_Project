Little Goat Diner////They have a lot of vegetarian options - we got the paratha burrito and it was very flavorful and yummy. Would recommend it for sure but that's because i haven't tried any of the other dishes. I did have a bite of the veggie burger american style and it was rather bland. I'd stick with the paratha burrito or one of the more exciting veggie burger options.
