Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Danielle was our server and she was super attentive and made great recommendations for the table. She brought the food out as it was ready, and everything was delicious! Even better, she kept the sangria coming, just like we wanted. With such a diverse age-range group, I imagine it was tough for her to keep up with our demands ( think "sippy cups! more sangria! more bacon wrapped dates! even more bacon wrapped dates and refill the sippy cup while you're at it!)", but she was great.
