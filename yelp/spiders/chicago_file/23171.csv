Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place was on the list of recommendations from our friends. We were pretty excited as we love pizza. It was very average to me. Had the express lunch that came with a salad and a personal pizza with sausage. Sweet onion balsamic dressing was amazing. I asked the waiter to add pepperonis to mine but he said he could not. The menu clearly says you can add extra ingredients for $1.15 per topping. I showed him the menu and he still said it was not possible. Huh? Â Oh well. Average pizza and terrible iced tea.
