Little Goat Diner////The French toast with fried chicken and a fried egg in the middle is absolutely fantastic! It was fairly large so I had enough for leftovers. My companions each had the blueberry pancakes and both were happy with their choices. The pancakes looked deliciously fluffy! Can't wait to bring my boyfriend here for breakfast!
