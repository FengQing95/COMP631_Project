Little Goat Diner////I do not have a sweet tooth and while reading over the menu options I became intrigued by the Bull's Eye French Toast. I don't typically order french toast because it is easy to make at home. The french toast caught my eye due to the interesting ingredients (eggs . crispy chicken . sweet onion brioche . BBQ maple syrup) I must say despite the sweetness it was quite delicious. The egg that is perfectly cooked with the yolk that once you cut through it, it runs together with the BBQ maple syrup to cut the sweetness and you are left with an amazing mingling of flavors.
