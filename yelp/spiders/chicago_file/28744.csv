Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our service was mediocre. Our waiter wasn't very helpful, and elongated our checkout time to the point of extreme frustration. I even asked to pay up front because we were tired of the neglect and have places to visit during our time here. Our waiter showed up five minutes after we sat back down and took our payment, then dropped off the card and receipt without any final remarks.
