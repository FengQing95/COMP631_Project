Art Institute of Chicago////Matisse, Renoir, O'Keefe, Gauguin, Manet, Monet, Picasso--my mind was blown walking by painting after painting by the masters. I knew my kids would not last long, so I started with the impressionists which is what most people talked about their in their reviews. They then wanted some more modern things, and this museum had those weird paintings that I think a kindergartner could do too. They had sections we didn't get to on Islamic arts, we breezed through some of the Asian art sections getting to the gift Museum (the only thing they would agree to.) The layout is a bit confusing, so we ended up talking to a lot of the "ask me" and "information" ladies who are super friendly and super helpful. Ages 13 and under are free and we ended up at the family center where they had a fully staffed room for poster making art projects where you got to collage and do rubber stamps and then they enlarged it on the photocopier to make a poster. My 12-year-old wasn't super impressed, nor was my 15-year-old. I think it's for the younger kids, but it was good to sit down and rest from all the walk, walk, walking. My daughter was a student so she was $19, my husband and I were $25. I ordered my tickets online and went through the membership line and she just beeped my tickets on my phone. No waiting in line. She didn't even make me check my backpack, although the guy on the other side with the second museum seem shocked by that. I took off a star since my kids were not amused for very long, but maybe there's nothing you can do with this new cell phone generation. We made it about two hours which was not nearly long enough for me, but too long for them. C'est la vie.
