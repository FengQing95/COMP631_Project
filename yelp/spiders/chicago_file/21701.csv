Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Why is this the best in Chicago? The sauce on the pizza RUNS LAPS around the others....dough is fantastic...cheese is lovely....and the experience is great all around.  Pizza is about the sauce and the dough...toppings are what you make of it.  Lou takes home the Chicago crown...end of story.
