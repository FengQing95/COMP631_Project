Little Goat Diner////I also cannot stand when restaurants charge separately for fries. Just include it with burgers and sandwiches and charge more for them. It is nickle and diming when it is listed separately for an additional charge. Nobody loves nickle and diming and it looks stupid on the menu. This isn't a steakhouse, it's a diner.
