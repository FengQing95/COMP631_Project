Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Even the personal size comes out in 20-35 min (i wasn't counting, but was warned) I enjoyed every second of that pizza! Crispy, but not overcooked, juicy from the tomatoes, and the meat made it super filling! I enjoyed my two Goose Island wheat beers, paid in a flash, and left. I think there was an upstairs and curbside seating.
