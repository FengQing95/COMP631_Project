Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////One of the things that I had to try when I planned a trip to Chicago was the deep dish pizza. Lou's came highly recommended. We waited about 35 minutes and our food came shortly after. We started with an appetizer of breaded mushrooms, which could have used some seasoning, but I guess that's why it's served with dressing. The mushrooms were fresh and juicy though.
