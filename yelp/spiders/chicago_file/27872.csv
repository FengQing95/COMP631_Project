Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Don't let the crowd scare you away. Went on a Friday night and the crowd outside almost scared me away. Hostess said the wait was 45 min and we probably only waited for 20. I do think the crowds can cause some confusion with the ordering process. You have to place your pizza order after putting your name in because the pizza takes so long to cook. After getting seated, it took awhile for our waitress to get drinks. The waiting was sooo worth it. We got The Malnati's classic and added pepperoni, garlic and basil. You have to add garlic and basil to any pie you get! Even our waitress commented on how good the smell was. Definitely will be back!
