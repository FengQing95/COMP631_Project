Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Good American style tapas. This is not authentic Spanish tapas, neither in presentation nor flavor. However, the menu is very clear about what you are ordering, and it's hard to go wrong since everything we had was good. The serrano ham tasted a lot like prosciutto, which was disappointing, but the bacon wrapped dates made up for it. We only tried the traditional red sangria, but it was excellent. Not too sweet or fruity, but had an ample amount of sliced fruit in the drink.
