Art Institute of Chicago////I like the idea of museums but I often get bored. I so enjoyed my time here! I wish we had designated more time to spend here but our weekend was short in Chicago so we left earlier than we wanted. There is a ton of stuff here in this space! The only disappointment was occasional dead-ends and navigating through the museum to avoid missing something. I'd recommend coming here and planning to spend hours in order to see everything and spend adequate time in each section.
