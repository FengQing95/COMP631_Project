Art Institute of Chicago////This place features the most eclectic collections of art from B.C to contemporary pieces. I have a blast here whenever I go. I'm, especially a fan of the asian art sections. I'm always astonished to see beautiful sculptures of Hindu gods. Take ur camera with you, as you can click pictures without turning the flash on.
