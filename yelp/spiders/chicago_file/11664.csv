Art Institute of Chicago////I went during a weekday and it was STILL packed. For good reasons, it really IS the museum of the States. They carry a big array of different collections and eras. You think you're finished, but look around the corner and it opens up an entire new section. It was pretty frustrating having to figure out which direction to go to make the least effort. However, there's art everywhere and that was the fun part.
