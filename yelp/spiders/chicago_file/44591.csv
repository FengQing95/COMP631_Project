Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////There were three of us and we ordered the.... citrus-cured salmon (not very good - too much cucumber mush on the bread), crispy spicy potatoes (YUMMM), baked goat cheese (YUMMM), chicken ham croquettes (yum), chicken empanada (small, but yum), some special beef tenderloin dish - three tenderloins with different toppings (yummmm)
