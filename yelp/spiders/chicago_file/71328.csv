Little Goat Diner////What I love is I tried to go online to look at the menu to be more specific about what I had, but THE MENU CHANGED...it's been 3 months since I visited this place, and the menu has already changed! A chef who knows how to keep you begging (and shaking) for more! This wasn't a disappointment.
