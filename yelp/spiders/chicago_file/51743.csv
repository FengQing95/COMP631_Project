Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of the best meals that I've had in a long time! The tapas were ridiculously good and everything on the menu was delicious. The potatoes were my favorite tapas that we chose, but they all were outstanding! The food was hot, flavorful, and delicious! It's the perfect place for casual dining, spending time with friends, or even a casual date! The servers and staff are SO friendly and definitely knowledgable and helpful when it comes to giving recommendations. I will definitely be coming back!
