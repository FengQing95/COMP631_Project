Smoque BBQ////This place is overrated, a bit pricey as well for the portions you recieve, especially the sides. The only side that is a decent size is the fries. The ribs and chicken were both really dry. The seasoning didn't really have a wow factor, it was so-so. The brisket chili taste like the smell of wet dog. Six bucks for the smallest piece of ribs for six more buck I could go to goodis and get me a chicken and ribs dinner that would put this place to shame, especially considering goodis isn't a bbq place.
