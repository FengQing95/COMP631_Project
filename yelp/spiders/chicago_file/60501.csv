Smoque BBQ////All of that aside, however; this place is GREAT.  Seriously some of the best barbecue I have ever had.  The meat was incredibly lean but somehow still incredibly tender and perfectly seasoned.  I love love love the pulled pork sandwich (which is really so big it should be considered two sandwiches).  And oh my god the brisket!  And the macaroni and cheese is so creamy and cheesy and delicious and good!
