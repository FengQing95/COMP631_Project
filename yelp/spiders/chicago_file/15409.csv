Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We came in tonight to show my cousin and uncle who were visiting from the Philippines to a real Chicago deep dish experience.  Our server was so kind and inquisitive about how their trip had been so far.  Our cousin owns a pizza place in Cebu, and wanted to get some real mozzarella sticks-- an experience of quality midwestern cheese at its finest.
