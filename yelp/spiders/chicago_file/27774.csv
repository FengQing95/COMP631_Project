Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////FIRST TIME HAVING DEEP DISH AND OMG. The Chicago classic is a league of its own. Although I might still pick a Napoleon style pizza over Chicago, it doesn't mean it's not insanely good. All the cheesy goodness with sausage and a buttery crust, my mouth j's just watering thinking about it. Chicago deep dish is not so photogenic but who cares when it taste so damm good. I had both Lou Malnati's and giodarnos and you can't even compare. LOU MALNATI's takes the crown for me anyway.
