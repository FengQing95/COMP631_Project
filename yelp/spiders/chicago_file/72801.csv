Little Goat Diner////If you are eating in and there aren't any seats at the bar, you can let the cashiers know you want to eat upstairs.  That space is where they'll be holding cooking classes and they have a good amount of tables and chairs.  I don't know if this will always be open but it is open to the public for the time being.
