Little Goat Diner////My friends and I opted for a few different items so we could each share and get to try different things on the menu. I personally got the fried chicken and French toast which i was really excited about. The service is mediocre and very much diner like; so great job with recruiting there, on point! I was expecting the servers to be excited and walk us through why this menu is so popular and why it's not just typical diner food. Instead I got a "hi, ready to order?"
