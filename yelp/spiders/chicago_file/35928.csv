Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////One of my favorite restaurants of all time. The elote and crab salad are my favorites. Love all the seafood here. We had steaks for the first time here recently and I wasn't that impressed - they were very fatty cuts however the seasoning was good. All of the desserts here phenomenal, do not miss them. And all the drinks are great too. It's fun to sit at a table, a booth or even at the bar.
