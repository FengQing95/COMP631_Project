Smoque BBQ////We were expecting really great BBQ based on all the things we had heard about this place, but it didn't live up to the elevated expectations.  It's good BBQ but not great.  We sadly didn't get to try the brisket, which is what we went for, because they screwed up our order and we didn't realize until we got home.  The pulled pork was good but a bit dry and the St. Louis Ribs were even drier.  The cornbread was baked in little individual cups and ended up getting soggy in it's own steam.  Might go back to actually try the brisket, but otherwise not a repeat place for us.
