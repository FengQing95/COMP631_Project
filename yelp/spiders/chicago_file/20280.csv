Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ended up getting stranded at O'Hare so I figured I'd get a room downtown. I knew deep dish pizza would be on the menu for the evening but couldn't decide between this, Geno's East, or Giordano's. Finally I chose Lou's and I'm really happy I did. It was absolutely delicious. I had the pie delivered to my hotel room and it was still steaming hot when it got there. I will be in Chicago again in two weeks and I'm looking forward to eating a pie in the restaurant this time.
