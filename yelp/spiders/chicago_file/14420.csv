Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place came highly recommended and was delicious. We started with the calamari that was ok...but NOTHING like delicious Maggiano's. Their pizza was GREAT! Known for their deep dish pizzas, we went with that and got the house speciality of "The Lou" (spinach, cheeses, sliced tomatoes...YUM!). It was really good. I am not usually a deep dish person because it is wayyy too much breading for me (even though I am a carb lover), but their pizza was just the right amount of breading for deep dish. The crust didn't have a whole lot of flavor...but it was good.
