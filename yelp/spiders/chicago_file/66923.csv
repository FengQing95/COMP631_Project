Little Goat Diner////What a disappointment. This was just diner food that was supposed to be comfy and retro but was all pretty bland. For the prices you pay here, I expected both better food and better presentation. We made a reservation and some people were waiting 30-40 minutes for a table on a Wednesday afternoon - not sure for what. Not sure the appeal for this place expect the name recognition. Wouldn't go back.
