Little Goat Diner////Extremely long wait. We had spots at the bar but Â wanted to have conversation facing each other at the table. The food had a wide variety of unique ingredients and pairings. It didn't seem to satisfy my savory taste buds i wanted in the morning after a night of drinking. Most likely won't go again.
