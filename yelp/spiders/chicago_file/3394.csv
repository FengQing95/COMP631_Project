The Purple Pig////Chicago is probably one of the best if not THE best food cities in the US.  One of my favorite places that we had a few interesting tapas plates was this one.  I can join the ranks of thousands of yelpers and even bay area natives which have had the pleasure of trying this joint.  We were all immediately blown away by the creativity of the dishes advertised here on yelp and were looking forward to the 2nd snacking dinner of the evening.
