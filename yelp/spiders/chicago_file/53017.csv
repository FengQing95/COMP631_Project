Smoque BBQ////I had Sliced brisket and ribs. The meat was tender, juicy and beautifully smoked  The sauce was tasty. The most important thing is that the BBQ food was NOT COLD here, which made big difference from another 2 American style BBQ places I went to during last month.  But the sweet tea was a lit too sweet to me.
