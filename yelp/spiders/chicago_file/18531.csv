Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Whenever I'm in Chicago I have to have at least 1, no, more like 2 slices of Lou Malnati's pizza. The sausage is like nothing I've ever had before. It's flavorful, juicy and oh so yummy. There has never been a time when I haven't had to wait for a table but who wouldn't wait. I waited eagerly knowing that hands down I was getting ready to bite into one incredible pizza!
