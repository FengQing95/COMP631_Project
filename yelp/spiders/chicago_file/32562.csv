Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is absolutely superb in every way!!!   Came for my birthday dinner with 5 people (perfect amount for one of their great booths).  We ordered pretty much the entire menu and it was all excellent.  Things that particularly stood out: smoked whitefish ceaser salad, fried chicken, elotte corn, broccoli, duck terrine, chocolate pie.  The only thing that wasn't a home-run for us was the creamed spinich (the blue cheese just didn't work).  The atmosphere is fantastic.  We loved our server (he was a little rough around the edges---in a good way).   Their BYOB policy is also a fantastic idea (particularly because someone decided to share a glass of wine with me!).  The whiskey drinks were also great--I tried many of them.  For all the food we got I thought the value was spot-on, especially for the neighborhood, they could get away with charging a lot more!  I will be back.  Tip: Make a reservation well in advance!!!
