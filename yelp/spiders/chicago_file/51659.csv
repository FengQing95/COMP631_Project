Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came in with 9 on a Saturday night. Always a challenge for any server, but Lindsey made it look easy. Excellent service from pre dinner cocktails through our post meal coffees. Always a smile on her face, she was superb. The food was amazing as well as it always is. Highly recommend the horseradish beef dish and the spinach and manchego mushrooms. Delish!
