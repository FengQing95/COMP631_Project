Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We arrived around 5 or 6 in the evening on Sunday (8/6/17) and this place was packed. We reserved our table then put our order in and I proceeded to the bar. I ordered the local IPA they had on tap and it was crisp and refreshing. I put my phone to charge as they have outlets under the bar area only. They told us the wait for a table would be about 25 minutes and I only had time to order a beer and plug my phone in and they had already called us, yay for good service and timeliness! We were told to go upstairs and then the waitress escorted us to our table. Our waitress was really good! Very friendly and prompt on everything we asked for, I wish I would have got her name.  When we arrived at the table we ordered the stuffed spinach bread, it came out quickly and was full of oozing deliciousness.  After the spinach bread I was eagerly anticipating heaven in my mouth when my pizza came out. I had ordered the Lou; it comes with mushrooms, spinach, chunky tomato sauce, and globs of mouthwatering cheese.  I am a pizza lover so for me this experience was orgasmic, it was as if only I and "Lou" existed and boy was it delicious! I literally didn't hear any conversations going on around me and just sat and enjoyed my pizza and beer. Next time I am in Chicago, without a doubt, I will go visit good ol' Lou Malnati's for another pie.
