Little Goat Diner////Overall, despite the long wait this place is for sure worth it.  I wouldn't suggest it with a big group as they don't take reservations and I imagine the wait would be very long.  Also it is designed to be very stereotypically diner looking, so I wouldn't suggest it for a date.  But go with a friend and pig out on the deliciousness.
