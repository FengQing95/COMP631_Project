Little Goat Diner////We went there for dinner during the weekdays so it was pretty empty. However, the food was amazing. I tried a breakfast paratha (basically an omelette surrounded by flaky soft warm bread) and it superseded my expectations. It was a good combination of American with Asian flare. The brussel sprouts were surprisingly good and the service was speedy. I would come back.
