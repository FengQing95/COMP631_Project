Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////On a recent bachelor party trip, I was waiting and anticipating Chicago deep dish pizza.  We must have picked the wrong place.  It wasn't filling in terms of ingredients but also I wasn't full at all.  Zachary's from the SF Bay Area is better and it's not even in Chicago.  I am thinking we picked the wrong place.  Seems like touristy as well
