Little Goat Diner////Seriously the best experience I had dining in Chicago (which is my favorite food city!). I have many food restrictions and I was so looked after during a large dinner (where I would have been happy with a plate of grilled vegetables to spare the staff the trouble. My server Jillian brought dish after dish of everything I could eat and was so mindful of me in a sea of 40+ people that I was truly floored. Everything was so good and down to the Heath Ceramic plates, so very memorable!
