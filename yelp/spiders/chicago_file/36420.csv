Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////One of our favorite steak places in Chicago. Equally as good as a late night place to stop for a drink, and the kitchen is open later than most places downtown. Â The atmosphere is dark and hip. Ridiculously hard to get a reservation at, but if you just show up after 9, you might have a reasonable wait for a table.
