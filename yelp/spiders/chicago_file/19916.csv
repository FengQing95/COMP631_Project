Lou Malnati's Pizzeria//// But, on a recent trip to Chicago we thought we'd try Lou Malnati's and Gino's East and compare. Most people we asked had differing opinions, but Lou Malnati's gets my vote!  At least from a deep dish pizza point-of-view.  I think Gino's had the better atmosphere...LM's was a place people can comfortably bring their kiddos.  Nothing against kiddos...just not my scene!  But the pizza more than made up for it.  And since it's so popular and crowded, they let you place your pizza order while you wait in line!  You still have to wait for it once you get seated but the wait is cut way down!
