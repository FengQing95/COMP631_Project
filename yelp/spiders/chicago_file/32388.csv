Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////While visiting Chicago, we definitely wanted to try deep dish pizza. Lou Manalti's was in walking distance from our hotel, so we decided to try it. When we visited at beginning of November, restaurants could only have customers eat outside due to CoVid which was great because the weather was beautiful. We went at lunchtime and luckily a table was available.
