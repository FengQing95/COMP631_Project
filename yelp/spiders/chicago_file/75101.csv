Little Goat Diner////This place is great.  The atmosphere is like a typical diner.  The service is quick and polite.  If you have a group larger than 4, expect to wait quite a while.  Luckily they have a bar and bakery attached to the diner.  We had a group of 8 people so we waited over an hour for a table.  We spent the time in the bar and it flew by.
