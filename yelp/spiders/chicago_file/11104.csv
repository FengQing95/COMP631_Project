Art Institute of Chicago////During my college life, I had to go through Art appreciation class, where it wasn't appealing enough to hear about and to see in a book. But I was determined to make it to Chicago one day to see the amazing paintings, sculptures and more come to life. This museum hosts most of the prolific and one-of-a-kind exhibits in America. From byzantine to post impressionism, modern and more.. there is something for everyone to like and enjoy here. Also if you are a super MOVIE buff.. you will take note that Ferris, Sloane and Cameron had part of their awesome day off here.. :-)
