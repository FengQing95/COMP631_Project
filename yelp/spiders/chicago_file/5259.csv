The Purple Pig////We decided on the grilled octopus (my personal favorite!), turkey leg confit, and grilled broccoli. The octopus was so flavorful and cooked to perfection. It was paired with green beans, fingerling potatoes and salsa verde. The broccoli was really tasty because of the anchovy vinaigrette, roasted garlic, and toasted bread crumbs on top. Such a unique and exquisite way to eat broccoli! The turkey leg was probably the only item that didn't wow me as because it didn't seem much different than the turkey leg I can get at a fair. It was drenched in a sweet sauce, topped with lentils and came with bed of cabbage. I like the tapas style of this restaurant and there are other items on the menu I'd come back to try like the roasted bone marrow.
