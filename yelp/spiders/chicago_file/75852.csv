Little Goat Diner////They have breakfast options all day, along with sandwiches, salads and burgers, just as you would expect. But my goodness me, that Goat burger is a sight to behold and a monster to eat (though I did attempt it). So many different meats and flavors and textures....your mom and pop diner sure ain't got no burger like this. If you're hungry and ready to eat, then you're ready for this.
