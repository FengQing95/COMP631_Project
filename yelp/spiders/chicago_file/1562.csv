Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I had the Chicken and Waffle special with jalapeno and candied bacon. It was fantastic. Got a small order of the banana creme pie pancakes and really loved it as well. Had an hour wait for our party of four, but it was definitely worth it. Good quick service for how busy it was.
