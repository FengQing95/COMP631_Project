Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food was for the most part wonderful! Only issue was undercooked chicken on chicken kabobs-very very pink. However, the service was terrible. Our waiter was extremely slow and then rude and defensive when we would ask for something. We waited 35 minutes between when we had clearly stopped eating and plates were cleaned before we got a chance to ask for our check. The atmosphere of the place was very fun, it's loud, but a great place to go to hangout and try small dishes. Just don't go when you have to be somewhere afterwards for the pace is just unbelievably slow.
