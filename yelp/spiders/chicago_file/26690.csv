Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Of course we had to come here! What would a trip to Chicago be without some authentic pizza. We had the classic. It was amazing. The butter-crust was worth running a few extra miles. The bartender was friendly and the beer was cold. It was awesome to watch the bears win while throwing a few back in the heart of Chicago!
