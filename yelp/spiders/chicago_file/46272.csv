Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Drinks: We had to have the sangria of course! But here's the thing, my hubby and I are one of few who don't like wine. But we really liked the sangria! We had half pitchers of the peach and black raspberry. I personally liked the black raspberry better but both were yummy. Just so you know how much you are going to need to get tipsy, the half pitcher filled up all our cups (party of 4) and with about a cup and a half left to split among us. Two pitchers were good for us, we didn't want to fill up too much on liquids!
