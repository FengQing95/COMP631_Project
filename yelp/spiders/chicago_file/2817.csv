The Purple Pig////Oh, if only it wasn't so popular! People know about the Purple Pig. Off of Michigan, but just far off enough, there is a mystical swine restaurant on a patio. Inside, you will be told there is at least an hour wait, and when they text you, you have 10 minutes exactly to return to your table.
