Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The goat cheese, pistachio, mint, and orange preserve jarras with bread was absolutely to die for. Tangy soft goat cheese melded with the crunchiness of the pistachios and the sweetness of the preserves. Couldn't get enough of this! Unfortunately we had to because it was a tiny jar. Sad faces. Boyfriend loved the taste of the lamb kebabs and said they were delicious. The not so delicious part? Getting two two-inch kebabs for $9.
