Little Goat Diner////Pathetic attempt at creativity.  This restaurant uses the popularity of its sister restaurant to serve reconstituted french freezer food and rip-off the Big Boy menu.  People must be so bored that they turn to places like this for amusement..  We waited hours hungrily anticipating something new, something that breaks through glass it is so new and delicious.  I would have been more satisfied by a Baconator at Wendy's.  They even take credit for the Big Mac sauce! The low lighting and rich people at the trendy bar don't fool me.  This place sucked.
