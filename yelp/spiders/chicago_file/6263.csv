The Purple Pig////Crispy Pigs Ear-This seems to be a very popular dish. It's served with salty crispy pigs ear, mixed with kale, and pickled banana peppers and topped with a fried egg. You must break the yolk so it serves as a dressing to the pigs ear and mix it all together. If you just eat the pigs ear by itself, it will be too salty. The egg, kale and banana peppers helps balance all the flavors. Not sure if I'd get this again though.
