Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We started with the pinxtos platter, which is basically six different 'bites' and a good way to satisfy different tastes at the table (though you may all end up fighting over your favorite). We also ended up ordering about two tapas per person and skipping the paella since we wanted more flavor than 'filler' and I was quite happy with that decision. Â Just the perfect amount of food.
