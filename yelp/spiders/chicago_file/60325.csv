Smoque BBQ////One thing that has recently annoyed me about Smoque is apparent issues with "running out" of food later on weekend evenings.  One Sunday I called in for carryout, the person on the phone advised that they were out of brisket & pulled pork - no big deal, since I really wanted ribs, but they sounded like they would have preferred that I give up and order some other day.  On a more recent Saturday, I tried three times to call in an order about an hour or so before their closing time, but no one was picking up the phone.  The money I was going to spend at Smoque that night ended up going to Smokin' Woody's. Maybe this is just a new business "growing pains" thing that will eventually be resolved?
