Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////After reading all of the reviews I knew I had to try this place.  Just make sure to get there early.  My husband and I ordered the Rutherford omelet, which we could have easily split and left full.  Then I got a side of the Wildberry bliss signature pancakes because the pictures online looked so good.  They were indeed blissful and decadent.  My husband got a side of fruit, which was full of fresh, ripe fruit.  I wish we lived nearby so that we could have taken half of it home.  The portions were huge. We could only finish half of everything and left stuffed.  I'm glad we went because it was great.
