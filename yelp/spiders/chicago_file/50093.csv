Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Serrano ham, salchichon, chorizo & manchego ($9)---A great plate of curred meats. I really liked that they weren't overly salty, which is a common characteristic of charcuterie I don't particularly enjoy. Cheese lovers will love the Â manchego (a spanish goat milk cheese), so creamy!
