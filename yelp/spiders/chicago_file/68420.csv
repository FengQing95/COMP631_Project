Little Goat Diner////Everyone got something different and vocally enjoyed their breakfast food, soup, sandwiches. I personally got a cinnamon roll and the eggs benedict. While the 2 items individually tasted great, I think I made a mistake of trying to order both in the same meal. The combination of sweet of cinnamon and the kimchi and braised pork belly didn't taste the greatest after 6-7 bites. I ended up not finishing the benedict, but would try it on it's own again.
