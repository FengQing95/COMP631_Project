Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It was spectacular.  The tomatoes are the hero of this pie, not to say that all the other parts aren't pure perfection because they are.  The tomatoes taste like they were fresh picked, so pungent, such bright flavor, really, really special.  The cheese was creamy with just the right amount in each bite.  The sausage was soft but firm and flavorful but not overpowering.  And the crust was fantastic.  Crispy at the bottom and doughy and crunchy around the edge.
