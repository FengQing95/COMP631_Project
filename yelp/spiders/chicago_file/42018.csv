Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Maybe I have a high standard, but I thought the dining experience was just "ok." I took a generous sampling of the menu, including the platter on the top of the menu. The only dish that impressed me was the Morroccan chicken. It was a generous helping for tapas and the spices were blended perfectly! The garlic shrimp was disappointing - good flavored but low quality shrimp. I eat out so much that I'm very selective on where I spend my money. I won't go out of my way to come here again, yet I won't actively avoid it either.
