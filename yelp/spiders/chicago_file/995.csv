Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////We have been eating our way through Chicago. Some great places and a few decent ones. This place by far is at the top of the list. Food was absolutely delicious. Our server Jeremy was fantastic. Highly recommend the 45 min wait. A walk through millennium park while you wait is perfect. Â Make sure to order the bliss pancakes and a to go cup of intelligista coffee.
