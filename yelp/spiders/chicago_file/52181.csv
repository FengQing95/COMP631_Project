Smoque BBQ////Mmmm, the food. The menu is short and to the point. My boyfriend and I stick to the ribs, pulled pork, and chicken. All amazing (though the chicken can be dry sometimes). The fresh-cut fries are my personal favorite of any fries ever in the history of fries. The mac and cheese is a close runner up. When I'm in a healthy mood, I go for the salad, but it's not my favorite. (I think they use marinated sun-dried tomatoes on it, and I can't get into the flavor.)
