Little Goat Diner////I'm kinda sad I'm updating this to downgrade stars but I was just so disappointed with my dinner last night. I ordered the parathas burrito again after my amazing experience last time and in a few months they have decided to make the burrito a lot smaller than before and the amount of salad on top was 1/4 of what I got last time (and how do I remember exactly how much was on my plate last time- bc I took a pic which ironically enough was attached to this review). And the bread was so dry and hard, it was a workout cutting through it.
