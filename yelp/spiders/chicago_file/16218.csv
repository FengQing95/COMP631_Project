Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Of all the deep dish pizzas I have had in Chicago, this place is tops for me.  I am a person that's not big on having too much sauce on my pizza and usually like my sauce thick.  Lou Malnati's: check!  You will feel as if you get more cheese here on your pizza than sauce which is perfect for me.  Also the crust is not cornmeal and buttered well so you get a nice crunchy crust.  I would also recommend starting the meal off with the Malnati Salad as well.  Really good flavorful dressing on that.  Another note: don't ask for too many vegetables on your deep dish pizza because it will make the pizza a little runny due to the water that cooks off the vegetables... You can never go wrong with plain sausage in my opinion.
