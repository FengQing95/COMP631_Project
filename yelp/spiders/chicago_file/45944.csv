Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ask me about the music they played or the table cloth they had and I won't have a clue. But if you ask me about the food, I could go on a spree about how great the food is! Everything that I have tried here from spicy potatoes to paella has been great!!! The cherry on the cake is that after all the food, the cheque still doesnt burn a hole in your pocket. Definitely coming back!!
