Art Institute of Chicago////This is a LARGE museum with a ton of walking.  If you plan to take children, I would recommend trying to hit the highlights quickly and then see other things as time and patience allow.  Since the cost is no small thing, going on one of the free nights would be perfect with the whole family.  That way nothing is lost if the kids just can't take one.more.artwork.
