Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love cafe babareeba for their atmosphere and food. Â Their tapas are generally good but it really depends on what you get. Personally, their paella and meatballs were flavorful but a bit salty. We absolutely love their chicken empanadas and deviled eggs. Their SANGRIA is amazing -- you can choose from flavors such as passion fruit, white peach, and black raspberry. Currently they have Mango sangria as their seasonal sangria (I think) and it's soo yummy!
