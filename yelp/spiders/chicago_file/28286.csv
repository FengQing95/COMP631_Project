Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Take this review with a grain of salt. I'm from NYC and no one does pizza better than NYC. I had "the" deep dish. It was good. Good mix of tomato flavor. The crust was perfect. It was essentially a pizza in the form of a pie but not anything earth shattering. Additionally wish the service was a little faster
