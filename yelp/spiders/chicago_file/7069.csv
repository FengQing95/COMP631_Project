Art Institute of Chicago////Take the opportunity - it's world-class.  Whatever your taste in art - it's here.  If you aren't into art museums, go anyway - you'll be converted before you leave.  I've seen countless rare showings over the years, but my favorite remains the Arthur Steiglitz photography exhibit from 1988 or so - some of the best art Georgia O'Keefe had a hand in (no pun intended).  Discount admission for students (bring the ID).  Easy to get to by CTA.  Take Metra from the suburbs and get a decent exercise walk the rest of the way - breathe that lake air for a change.
