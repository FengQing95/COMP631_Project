Little Goat Diner////My friends and i came here for Sunday brunch and had a great experience. We made reservations and were seated within 5 minutes. I would recommend making reservations because the people that didn't definitely had a long wait. We ordered a mimosa carafe which was the perfect size for 4 people-we each got about 1.5-2 mimosas out of the carafe. I ordered the dark chocolate chip pancakes which were pretty good-i would give a 4/5. It would've been better if served with regular butter as opposed to the chocolate spread that they offer. The portion was pretty big-i was pretty hungry going into brunch and ate the whole thing but i was really full afterwards (i probably should've just ate part of it, oh well!). The atmosphere was casual and great for a mid day brunch with girlfriends. The service was pretty attentive. I would love to come back and try other items on the menu. My friends got the burger and the French toast and they loved their choices.
