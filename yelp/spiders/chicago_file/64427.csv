Smoque BBQ////This is one of the great BBQ restaurants in America and we are lucky it's in Chicago.  Every meat and side are very good to excellent.  Even the chicken is highly recommended.  Usually go for the brisket chopped and a taste of another meat.  But it really doesn't matter as ALL the meats are top notch.
