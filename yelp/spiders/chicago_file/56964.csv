Smoque BBQ////I was super impressed with their crowd management. My husband hates waiting in line so we tricked him into going here even though we knew there would be a wait. On a Saturday night at about 7:30 we waited outside for about 15 minutes. Once we got inside I was a little worried because this place is tiny. Every seat was taken and lots of people in line still. They asked us how many we needed to seat and I have no idea how they did it but they seated us as soon as our food was ready, and everyone else in line too. Amazing!
