Art Institute of Chicago////This place is HUUUUGE. Don't do what I did and just start at the first floor and work my way around. You should pick out what your favorite kind of art is and head there in the beginning of your tour. My favorite kind of art is impressionism and thats at the top... near the end of my own tour... so by the time I had gotten there I was EXHAUSTED. I was so tired, I couldn't really enjoy the art as much as I would have liked.
