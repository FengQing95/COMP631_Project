Little Goat Diner////We like eating brunch here, but sometimes feel the menu is too complicated. I get having a unique menu, but sometimes all we want is a normal run J. Space/environment is great, but overall this is a place I would eat at once a year versus other places we like that we eat at a couple times a month.
