Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Frequently felt neglected by server (perhaps too many tables not enough servers) on a Sunday night. Service was okay until end of meal. Ignored by staff for 25 minutes until we flagged somebody down to order desert. Gave my credit card to server when ordering dessert because we were in a hurry, but server totally forgot about it and ended up taking a second group member's credit card. Didn't get a change to correct the mistake because we were in a hurry. Had yelp special for "free dessert" when you check in. Turns out waiter didn't bother deducting it from our bill, but we didn't notice until after we had left. Oh, and it took another 25 minutes to get the check. Sloooow. Food was good; not sure if I will be back.
