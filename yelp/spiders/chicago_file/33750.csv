Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////To summarize, Bavettes is the best of the bevy of hip new restaurants that opened in the last year. I thought it was far superior to Au Cheval, which is owned by the same people. I love trying new places, but seldom do I leave and want to make a reservation to come back the next weekend.
