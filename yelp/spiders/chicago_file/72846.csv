Little Goat Diner////Service: no wait for one at 10am on a Friday. My server, Amanda, was delightful and prompt. Extra points for this being the first restaurant I've ever been asked if I had allergies or dietary restrictions, which I thought was a classy touch. The space is open and modern, but not sterile by any means.
