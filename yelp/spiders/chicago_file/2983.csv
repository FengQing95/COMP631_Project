The Purple Pig////If I drove past this place once, I must have driven past there 20 times. If we didn't try it on the first night, you can guarantee that we would have tried it at some point during our trip. Talk about a hot location. We walked in at Thursday at 7:30 and it only took 45 minutes to get a table. Not too shabby.
