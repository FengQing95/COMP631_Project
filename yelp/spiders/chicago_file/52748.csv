Smoque BBQ////Very good bbq. I don't like the slaw(oil and vinegar), prefer creamy with my que. But everything else is great. Remember: It's bbq, not fine dining, no one cares about peeling paint, we want bbq!! My go-to is the pulled pork, done quite nicely!! The brisket is good, but not great. Ribs are wonderful, I like the St. Louis ribs best! The beans are also great. I don't give it 5 stars because it's expensive, bbq shouldn't be expensive.
