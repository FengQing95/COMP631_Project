Little Goat Diner////Anyway after looking at the menu I decided I really wanted to eat a brunch item because well I was still kind of craving breakfast. I narrowed the items down to either the Brandade and Belly or the Kimchee & Bacon & Eggs & Pancake (super long entree name). When the waitress came to take our order, she suggested the brandade especially if you don't mind a more "seafood" flavor. The boyfriend then ordered the Shrimp and Cheesy Grits with a side of hashbrowns light on the cheese.
