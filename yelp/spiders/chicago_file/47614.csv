Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Nothing stood out to me here.  I like that the menu highlights most popular items so we tried the burrata, grilled steak with chimichurri, and bacon wrapped dates, along with a few other items and a pitcher of sangria that was heavy on ice.  Both the food and drinks were mediocre.  The place was freezing, so we politely told our server who had the air turned down, but moments later it was back in full force and if you looked around everyone in the room started putting their coats on.   I think restaurant staff should be more receptive of things like that.  Overall just an ok experience.
