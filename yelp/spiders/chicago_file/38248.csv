Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Unfortunately the steak was lukewarm in the center and the aged strip did not have the complex flavor I was hoping. I like the ambiance and the cocktails were well executed. If you are looking for a great steakhouse go somewhere else. If you are looking for drinks and a place to hangout this place works.
