Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My four stars are for the atmosphere. Something I really miss about Chicago restaurants, the perfectly lite spaces. Don't get my wrong I also enjoyed the food, the beverages and the service but the ambience Â was what did it for me. I'm a sucker for that prohibition throwback look.
