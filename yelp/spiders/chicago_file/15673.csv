Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's is always my go-to for Chicago-style deep dish.  However, I may be slightly biased since I grew up on the stuff and it kind of tastes like 'home' to me.  The service may not always be perfect, the pizzas are huge so they take a long time to bake (if you have to also wait for your table, put your pizza order in before you sit down to expedite things), it might be crowded, and isn't the most glamorous decor, but in my book, the taste of the pizza always makes up for this.
