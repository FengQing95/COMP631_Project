Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This won't be a popular opinion in Chicago, but I had the Lou Classic and I have had various deep dish pizzas in San Francisco (Little Star being the best) and so far SF holds the lead.  The pizza was good, but I can't say there was anything special about this particular deep dish pizza.  Way over oily due to the cheese and the butter crust was fine but nothing to rave about.
