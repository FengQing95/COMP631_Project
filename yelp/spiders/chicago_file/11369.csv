Art Institute of Chicago////My favorites were the Japanese wood block prints in the Lower Level and the Impressionist Claude Monet Room on the second level. I'd recommend starting at the Second Floor and making your way down for new visitors. So surreal to stumble upon art that you see everywhere (Sunday at the Park for example), and have a moment of realization that this is the original artwork. So beautiful, and so neatly organized. The staff are super helpful too. And watch out for free days for Illinois residents, like Free Resident Day and Chicago Museum Week.
