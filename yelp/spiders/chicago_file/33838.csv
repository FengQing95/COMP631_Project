Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Fantastic find on trip advisor while on a business trip.  Luckily they were able to accommodate us and we had a fantastic meal in the downstairs room.  Great buzz, food options were great, only knock would be that there was a limited Wine List.  Definitely book a reservation
