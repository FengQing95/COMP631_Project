Smoque BBQ////My favorite BBQ place in Chicago. Other than mac n cheese (which is just mediocre), everything else is fantastic. The succulent ribs are smoky and so soft it is so easy to pull the meat apart from the bone. The chilis here are delicious, very rich and tasty. The brisket is also tender and goes well with the chilis. I usually get the coleslaw and cornbread to diversify the flavors a little bit as well. They also have a variety of BBQ sauces of course, from sweet and spicy to tangy and smoky. And no matter how full I am, I always wrap up my Smoque experience with some of their pecan bread pudding.
