Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Came here for an anniversary dinner and everything was on point. I procrastinated on making reservations, so we got a table at 9pm. Dark ambience with a unique, but delicious, wine selection. Klee, a pinot noir, was recommended and it was delicious and did the job. The salad was a great start, the filet was a great entree (cooked perfectly) and the anniversary dessert was a great ending. Service was fantastic throughout. Recommend for a nice dinner.
