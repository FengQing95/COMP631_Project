Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I want to give this place another try but I really don't feel like going back.  I went for dinner and the dishes were not amazing or spectacular.  I've definitely had better and that was at Cafe Iberico.  The service was good, the ambiance is nice but the food did not do it for me.
