Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've had all of the following and recommend them all:  the fried chicken, the steak frites, the 6 oz. duchess cut, the shaved prime beef sandwich, the Elote-style corn, the broccoli, the thick cut bacon, the wedge salad, and the baked crab cake.  We have taken down the chocolate cream pie and the lemon meringue pie...spectacular.
