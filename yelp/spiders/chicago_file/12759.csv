Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place is excellent!!!!... I came here with my husband, we had the chicken wings for appetizer and after we ordered the deep dish sausage and spinach pizza, it was the best deep dish ever. The service was great as well. Perfect place for either a large group or a nice one on one dinner. The prices are decent for the quality of food.
