Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love this place - I have been more times than I can count and the food and service is always fantastic. Bacon wrapped dates are a must. The sangria is also fantastic - which it should be for a Spanish place. The black raspberry sangria is a personal favorite. The cava sangria is good too. I would highly recommend this place to anyone coming to Chicago or a native that hasn't been there yet.
