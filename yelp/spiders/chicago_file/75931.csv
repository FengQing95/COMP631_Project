Little Goat Diner////Food was fantastic! However, service and atmosphere were so-so. Our server didn't greet us until about 15 minutes in, and then our mimosas took about 15 more minutes to arrive. All while we were sweating profusely because the restaurant was soooo hot (I've had this same issue at Duck Duck Goat too?). By the time we left, we all had sweat dripping down our faces. All that being said, food was on point and delicious.
