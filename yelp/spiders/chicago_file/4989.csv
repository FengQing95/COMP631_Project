The Purple Pig////Absolutely love this place! And well worth the wait, although I always plan ahead to have the 1-2 hour wait. I highly suggest smaller parties to go with to have a smaller wait time. The place is semi small so it definitely gets crowded quickly and all the time. Also there always seems to be a line for the restrooms.
