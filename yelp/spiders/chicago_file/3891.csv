The Purple Pig////Nice vibe. Quite noisy. Good cocktails. Playlist was bad 70's pop rock. Interesting menu,  however not all items were well executed. Roasted bone marrow was good. Nice to see this dish on the menu. The accompanying bread left much to be desired . This dish is fat, parsley, capers, salt and bread. The bread is an important component of the dish. They need to do better. Crispy fried pig's ears were overly salty, as were several other dishes. Sadly, the night we were there, the lamb shanks were a disaster. Seriously off. The dish was served with lovely spring vegetables - a beautiful presentation, however the baby carrots carried the unmaskable taste of being cooked with something that was burned, and then overly salted. My first thought was that the roasting pan caught fire and that the kitchen had used salt to put it out. That bad. The half duck was okay. The garnish of Greek yogurt with salmon roe sadly did not work with the fish. I cannot imagine what they were thinking. Even Yotam Ottolenghi would cringe. Really wanted to like this place. Innovative plates, but in the end, they appear unable to carry them off. With so many excellent restaurants in Chicago I was surprised that they were so busy on a week night. Maybe we  caught them on an off night?
