Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////After we were seated, the server came promptly and took our drink orders. We chose the half pitcher of their classic sangria. Their sangria, for lack of better terms, is like a fine crack that you will become addicted to as you sip each sip. Be careful. You have been warned. The half pitcher contained a generous amount; enough for two people on a first date trying to ease the pain of the awkward encounter you must hurdle through. I got buzzed, SUCCESS!
