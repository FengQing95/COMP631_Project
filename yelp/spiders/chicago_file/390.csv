Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Wow this place has the best pancakes I ever had! I had them with strawberries, it was so fresh and so yummy! I also had a pina colada smoothie which was equally amazing. The place looks cute and the staff was very cheery. I'm so happy I found this place on my first visit to Chicago, and if I ever go back to that state, I would definitely make it a point to go there again. It's right near all the touristy spots too.
