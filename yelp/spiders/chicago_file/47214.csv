Smoque BBQ////let's start with the sides. coleslaw... ehhh... never cared so much about that style of coleslaw although my sister seemed to favor that style. the mac-n-cheese? holy smokin' shopping cart! i love home-style mac-n-cheese! i'm a big mac-n-cheese fan, either home cooked or the fancy ones from restaurants so i've tried a lot of different maccies from different places and let me tell you (well, let my writing tell you) it was one of the best mac-n-cheeses i've had. it came in a smaller container (wish it was bigger; maybe next time i'll supersized the darn thing) and the top part was "baked to perfection". crispy bits and pieces of cheese... heck yea! and last but not least, the fries. i quite like them actually. i tend to prefer the thin cut ones but this seemed to go along with the ribs perfectly.
