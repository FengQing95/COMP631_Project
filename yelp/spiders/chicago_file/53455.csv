Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Squid in vinegarette - another simple dish, very authentically Spanish, and so good. There are not dozens of flavors in most of these tapas, just delicious ingredients - and the food seems better to me than the last time I was here (more than 15 years ago!). Both the dates and the squid were swimming in a delicious juice that tasted great sopped up with the bread.
