Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is one of my all-time favorite spots in Chicago. Tapas usually are not my jam, but they give such great portions here and the food is AMAZING. I dream about the potatoes with the red dipping sauce. This time we went for happy hour, so we started with the sangria flight--highly recommend! Loved sampling a few new things from the menu that I hadn't tried before.
