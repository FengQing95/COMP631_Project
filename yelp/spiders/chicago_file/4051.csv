The Purple Pig////We ordered the almonds, pig ears and cannoli - all were delicious. Our least favorite was the "tater tots" - we were not a fan of the sofrito.  The carrots & plantain dish was delish and was our favorite.  We stopped there, in an effort to preserve our waistline and pocketbook. However, there's a distinct possiblity we are returning tonight to get the Brussels sprouts, pork shoulder and fried cheese :)
