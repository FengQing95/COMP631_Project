Little Goat Diner////My wife and I stopped in for a grilled cheese sandwich, tomato soup, and a cookies and cream milkshake. Service was quick and friendly, food was delicious! The Little Goat Diner is a great spot for a quick bite in Chicago. I look forward to coming back next time I'm in the city. Also, grab some pictures at the photo booth!
