Little Goat Diner////My second time at this joint, and the Parathas Burrito (under the Cereal Killers section) blew me away. I wasn't expecting the fresh salad mound on top, and it was so full of flavor. Big size, too! The beer selection wasn't very extensive, lacking in the darker beers with a single stout, but the other cocktails looked nice. I've also had the Goat Chili, and that was a nice side if you're looking to really fill up. So many exciting and unique menu items, kudos to Chef Izard!
