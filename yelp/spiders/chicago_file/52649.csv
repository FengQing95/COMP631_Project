Smoque BBQ////It was great before all the hype and it's still great.  Their brisket is awesome as is their sauce which is handed over in small containers for you to distribute as you wish.  I don't particularly recommend the brisket or pulled pork sandwiches because you can't really get all that BBQ flavor through the flavorless pieces of bread.  I'm also just not a big fan of going to BBQ places and getting pulled pork sandwiches, but especially here.  The mac&cheese beats out most of the other sides, but the beans are still a must.  The interior can get pretty packed around peak times, so a line forms.  Also, during a visit, I dropped my food and they replaced it within 30 seconds, with no additional charge.I don't recommend doing this, it was just a nice thing they did for me.
