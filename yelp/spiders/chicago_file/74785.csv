Little Goat Diner////Right next to me there was the much recommended "This Little Piggy Went to China" featuring Szechuan Pork Sausage, which was very well garnished but essentially the same size as a McDonald's breakfast biscuit. On the other end of the spectrum, there is the Los Drowned (braised beef) and The Fat Club (turkey), which were both so huge that they had to take the other half to go. All that disparity was found in items that are only separated by a $1 difference in price, so choose wisely!
