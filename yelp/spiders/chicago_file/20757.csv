Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I placed an order from their Taste of Chicago menu for my family as Christmas gifts. I placed an order online for two of there 6 packs of Pizzas, and then added an extra 2 pack. Making it a total of 14 Pizzas to give to my family and friends who are all from Chicago, now living in South Florida. After placing the order online I found it strange that I had not received a confirmation email. So a few days had passed and I was concerned. I then called Lou Malnati's to confirm that my order was placed. The woman I spoke with said she did not have an order for me in the system. I immediately panicked as I was concerned if I replaced the order, they would not be shipped out in time for Christmas Day. I asked if I could place the order with her over the phone and she said yes, and that they would make it in time. I went ahead and placed the same exact order I thought I had previously placed online. A few days later I received confirmation that my order had shipped. I anxiously awaited it. A few days later I received the order, but then realized I had not received the complimentary cheesecakes that I was supposed to receive for ordering so many pies. I noticed that I had an email with another tracking number from Lou Malnati's which I figured must be for the cheesecakes. When I looked at my bank account I saw that I had been charged twice. Each order was over $280. So, I called Lou Malnati's again, and they told me that I should only be charged once because they only had one order for me and that it was probably just my bank. I waited to see if it was a bank error and would clear. Sure enough, the charges were removed the next day. The following day I received the order of what I thought would be just the cheesecakes. My bank account was once again showing cleared transactions for TWO orders. What I received was a whole other order of the same stuff plus the cheesecakes. I contacted Lou Malnatis AGAIN, spoke to the SAME representative AGAIN, and she told me that nothing could be done. Â She said that because the order shipped that I had to pay for them. I couldn't ship them back because they would spoil. I explained that I had spoken to her several times before and that she was the one that told me she didn't have the first order from me, which is why I placed the second order over the phone. She apologized, and her consolation to me was to send me a $50 merchandise credit.
