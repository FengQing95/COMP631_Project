Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This pizza is good if you don't like flavor. I mean bland! Tried the Lou and a pepperoni. I was blown away by Labriola last time I was in Chicago, so I couldn't wait to try the restaurant that seems to be at the top of all the best lists. Might be just me, but this was as bland and flavorless as could be, and the deep dish crust is just Plain undercooked and boring.
