Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Not for me. I love the crust but I prefer a sweeter sauce and more cheese. It was my first ever experience with Chicago Pizza. It was delicious and I ate every ounce of it bc it was a treat for me to have PIZZA. I am Sicilian so my favorite is fluffy pizza, with sweet sauce, and a lot of cheese!
