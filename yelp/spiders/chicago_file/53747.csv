Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////They brought my chicken and I asked where was the sauce that comes with it every time I've gone there, he said it doesn't come with a sauce and actually ARGUED with me about it, even though I tried to explain to him that I've been to this restaurant at least nine or ten times and I Â always had the sauce on the side in a small silver cup. After all this is my favorite dish here.
