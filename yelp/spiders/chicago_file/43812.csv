Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////First off, our wait time was 2 hours! I understand it was a Sat night at 7:30...but 2 hours!! We put our name in anyway and proceeded to the back near the bar. Decided to order a pitcher of Red Sangria from the bartender to make the time go by quicker. Sangria was ok...I have had better...but each pitcher was 9 glasses worth and for only $18.50 you can't go wrong!!
