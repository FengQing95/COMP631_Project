Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My boyfriend and I came here for my birthday and we were disappointed. We started with a dozen oysters, which were standard. The house made bacon in the wedge salad was fantastic, but the salad itself was grossly overdressed and very dill heavy. For our entree I ordered the petite filet and him the Chicago cut steak. His steak was inedibly salty and mine was nothing to write home about.
