Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We all ended up getting the dry-aged ribeye cooked at varying degrees. I ended up getting mine medium well. The steak was cooked to perfection. It was tender and flavorful. I added the seasoned salt on top and it pulled additional flavors from the steak as well. For sides we had the fries with garlic aoli (so addicting), the Brussels sprouts, creamed spinach and the truffle Mac and cheese topped with bacon. The truffle Mac was by far the best Mac N Cheese I've ever had and it was the highlight of my meal there. Definitely recommend it; you will not be disappointed!
