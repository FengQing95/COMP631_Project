Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We also enjoyed their chocolate cream dessert with a french press cup of coffee featuring Bowtruss beans. That combination is absolutely perfect. A bite of that chocolate mousse cake (I forgot the name but it's a signature chocolate dessert on their menu) and then a sip of the warm french press mingled together in the mouth equals an absolutely beautiful mixture of light yet rich sweetness plus a roasty coffee finish. I still think about that combination - even days later.
