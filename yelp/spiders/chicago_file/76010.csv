Little Goat Diner////I don't remember all the dishes we ordered but it was plenty for 4 instead of just my girlfriend and I. Our table was far too small for all our food. Though the food needed some salt and pepper, it was extremely greasy. Not my favorite for breakfast really but I guess it's american style.
