Little Goat Diner////This review is mainly regarding the host staff with a small food review. I want to preface this by saying that from 1998 - 2004 I worked in restaurants as a busser, hostess and waitress from 16 until I finished college, so I am pretty familiar with how things go in restaurants and am extremely sympathetic to my brothers and sisters in the biz because I know how hard you work for very little in the way of thanks or compensation.
