Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm from Houston and this was my first time having a legit Chicago deep dish.. AMAZING. These pizzas are way more delicious than I thought they would be. I imagined they would be way too saucy with tomato sauce/juice/whatever everywhere which I don't care for, but that was not the case. Everything the deep dish was jam packed with were top ingredients that combined to make each bite a treat. Being so filling, these pizzas really give you your moneys worth, and the atmosphere and concept of the place is very pleasant as well. We went during a non-busy time of day, and I'd say the only downside is the half an hr wait for your pizza to be made.
