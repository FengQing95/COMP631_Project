Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is one of the original deep dish joints in Chicago.  We had to try this one in addition to Uno's/Due and Ginos East on my latest trip to Chicago.  I have had a Lou Malnati's pizza that my brother had shipped to Atlanta and it was great - but when we ate it straight from the oven... its just amazing.  It's just perfect - from the crust, to the cheese, to the sauce, to the toppings.  This deep dish pizza is one of the best in Chicago hands down.
