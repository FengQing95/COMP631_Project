Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So the BIG Chicago debate is Giordano's or Lou Malnoti's when it comes to great pizza. Anyone you ask for where the best pizza around is and they will choose one and stick to it no matter what. Now that I've had both and can compare I will say I'm staying with Giordano's as my favorite but these two are so close in my opinion it's crazy. I've had the thin crust which is ok and the deep dish which was amazing. The sausage pie consists of a single, complete piece of sausage on top. The peperoni is my fav. The sauce is good and the crust good too. I'm going with 4 stars bc there a notch just below G's in my book.
