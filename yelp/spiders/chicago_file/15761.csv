Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Yum! I dig the pizza here! The sauce is like magic in my mouth (or I probably thought that because I was starving all day when I got to Lou Malnati's)...I could totally taste the freshness in it and maybe some hint of wine in there too! I got the spinach mix (cooked with delicious garlic and onions) with cheese, which to that I say it's delicious. However I don't know if I can tell the crust was buttery because I ordered it with buttery crust for my pizza (individual-sized), and it came out a bit too hard and crunchy. Is that how it's supposed to be, Chicago people? Please help me, the tourist, out on this! I am not sure if the waitress didn't hear me right when I gave her my order, and might have forgotten to put that in? I don't know...The cheese did help me to eat it all.
