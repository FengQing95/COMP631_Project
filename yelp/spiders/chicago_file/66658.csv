Little Goat Diner////I Went for breakfast with friends based upon awesome reviews we heard. For a diner it is over decorated, for finer dining it was awfully loud. So loud we could not hear our server. The menu was limited to a few overthought choices. I wanted a traditional breakfast so I selected the small biscuits and gravy, 2 eggs and the cheesy grits. Biscuit was enjoyable with good texture but lacked ample gravy. A tiny ladle was stripped across the top. The eggs were small, obviously not grade A large. The grits were disgusting; coarse and bland! The chef fails at knowing grits are that in name only, not in texture! I had to remind myself I'm in the Midwest and some people are not familiar with their true form. They were also cold and only earned the cheese in their name from the light sprinkle on top. I could have ordered similar food at any diner in town and had better quality and flavor for a fraction of the price.
