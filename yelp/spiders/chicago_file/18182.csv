Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Horrible service.  Went on a Tuesday night, waited at least 15 minutes for waitress to bring our beers.  She barely spoke to us when taking our order and even worse, raced past our table as to not have to speak to us if not necessary.  Food delivered in an hour- 45 min was what she quoted. Again, Tuesday night and not a full house.  Pizza was absolutely disappointing. I could have ordered Domino's and got better pizza. The crust was gooey and undercooked while the bottom of the crust-burned.  Such a waste of time and money.
