Smoque BBQ////this place ALWAYS has a line to get in, and a long line.  then once in  you order, they call your number someone helps you find a seat in the cafeteria type seating and eat and people watch.  this is the best place to get an awesome meal and people watch as it is packed.  best to experience eating in, and then once you know the routine and want it, call in your order and have it as a pick-up, don't be fooled though even the pick up times can be a bit lengthy, all worth it
