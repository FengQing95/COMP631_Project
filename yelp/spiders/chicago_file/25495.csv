Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our first true Chicago style pizza was enjoyed here for dinner on a slow starting Monday night. We were seated upstairs at a nice big round comfortable table for our group of five out of owners. Our waitress filled us in on just how "dense" and filling their pizzas are despite their somewhat smaller diameter. We all were on the same mission to enjoy great pizza. My wife and I decided to split a small size Classic Lou Malnati's with Italian sausage.
