Smoque BBQ////I got a 1/2 & 1/2 platter (it's not on the menu) that consists of your choice of 2 meats (Pulled Pork, Brisket, or Texas Sausage), 2 sides, and the cole slaw.  I thought it was a great deal since the portions were not that much smaller than the full order.  I ordered the pulled pork & brisket which were both perfectly cooked and not dry at all.   The cole slaw is really light, it's not the stuff that's drenched in mayo, and goes really well with the BBQ.  The brisket chili & mac & cheese were also good.  The chili was a little lacking in the actual brisket but the flavor was there!
