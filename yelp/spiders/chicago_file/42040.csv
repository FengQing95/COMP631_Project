Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our twenty something son introduced us to Cafe Babareeba last year and we've been there now three times when visiting from Michigan. The tapas are incredible. A large and diverse selection...hot and cold. We usually are with a group and sample about 15 choices. Then we have long discussions about which was our favorite...and there is never agreement. The Sangria is deliciously refreshing on a hot day. It's definitely best to go with a group of six at least in order to get a good sampling of shared tapas. After getting stuffed we also enjoyed the nice walk back to the Brown Line at Fullerton for the trip back downtown. Eat here...several times!
