Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Strolled in here on a Thursday night around 7:30 hoping to get a table for two - no reservations or anything. We figured if they couldn't take us, we'd just hop over to Gilt or something like that. They were able to seat us, and boy am I glad we had the chance to eat here! As this place beomes more popular, who knows how crazy it'll become, but I hope they can keep up the service and quality.
