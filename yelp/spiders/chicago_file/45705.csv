Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba isn't a place to go to if you want nice ambience. It's loud, the chairs aren't exactly very comfortable, and expect a large crowd. But the FOOOOD. The food is pretty awesome. We ordered a bunch of things - the serrano ham, salchichon, chorizo, the roast dates with bacon & apple vinaigrette, rioja short ribs, manchego mashed potatoes, the beef skewer, horseradish cream & red onions, the ahi tuna, and seared scallops. Everything was portioned out really well and the mix of flavors was just incredible. Our server was also very helpful and attentive, which of course added to the experience.
