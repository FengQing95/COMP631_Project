Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Maybe it's the New Yorker in me .. but I just don't get the deep dish pizza. Pizza is something you can dine on-the-go and a very hands-on experience. Deep dish requires too much preparation .. Anyhow, seeing that this establishment was so highly reviewed, I was excited to come here but, man, the service here is SLOW to borderline despicable. We came in on a Sunday afternoon and was seated without reservation in maybe 10 minute. They encourage you to order the pizza before you get seated because the pie takes about 30 mins to make. So we went to the 2nd floor dining area, and it took the waitress at least 15 minutes before she introduced herself and another 5-10 minutes before we got our water. For a chain restaurant (they have multiple locations; reminds me of a localized Olive Garden), that's unacceptable. I overheard nearby patrons complaining about the same thing - "The waitress looked swamped" or "She's never around" .. but it seemed like she was manning 6 tables/parties max. I don't know if they're understaffed or just poorly trained. I know, as a waitress in NYC, the service we received would never fly.
