Smoque BBQ////I went on a Tuesday. Parking was horrendous. I think it is overpriced for what it is. I was not a fan of their sauce. The links were delicious, but the St. Louis ribs seemed overdone. I had them without sauce and they were dry. My daughter's chicken was ok. The fries were the best thing we tried. I wouldn't return because parking is too horrendous, but if I lived in the area, I might stop by once a month.
