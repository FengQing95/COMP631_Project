Little Goat Diner////Only got takeout here, but the restaurant itself is beautiful. I love the upscale diner feel of this place. Got the pork belly pancakes and they were delicious! I also like that the other side of the restaurant has a bar and coffee shop if you want to grab a quick drink or browse some of their pastries.
