Little Goat Diner////Saturday Lunch at the market, Fulton to be exact, incredibly busy outside as well as inside. We had a short wait, quite impressed with how quickly the meals move through this place. A couple seated at the bar recommended the Bloody Mary, so I gave it a try, nice and spicy, intensely red too, I like that. This was my first visit to the Little Goat, but my son had been here before and he ordered the Goat Almighty Burger last time as well as this time. A monster of a sandwich, quite photographic, it can be smashed down and turns out to be somewhat manageable considering its initial height. Doubt that I will ever be able to eat one of these, however my Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich turned out to be quite a monster itself. This was a very good sandwich, a wonderful bun which was toasted superbly, loved the pickled jalapeno, one of the best chicken sandwiches I have ever had. One more recommendation, Tempura Mashed Potato, quite an experience, not sure how to describe it, try it. (FDV Approved - Food, 4.2; Design, 4.2; Value, 3.3)
