The Purple Pig////I only got two dishes as I was actually in a hurry to get to my next meeting downtown. One of the more popular dishes I kept seeing on tables were the beets and grilled octopus and neither disappointed. The beets were flavorful and beautiful to look at. The pistachio pesto was my favorite flavor on the plate and had a similar texture to really smooth and creamy peanut butter. Octopus was very moist and had great texture. The vegetables were charred (in a good way) and were a great accompaniment to the salsa verse and potatoes that came with.
