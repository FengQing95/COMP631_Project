Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////On a Thursday night, the tables were filled and it was pretty loud. We could still have a conversation without yelling, and I thought the crowd kind of added to the atmosphere. The staff was attentive, and the tapas came out staggered so we were not bombarded at once with all of the plates. We ordered 1 cold and 3 hot plates, and 4 plates between 2 people was plenty. We also split the sampler dessert order and all 6 options were delish.
