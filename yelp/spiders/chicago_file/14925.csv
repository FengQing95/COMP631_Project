Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've lived in Chicago for four years now and Lou Malnati's is still my absolute favorite pizza!  I highly recommend the deep dish spinach pizza, while my boyfriend's favorite is "The Lou."  Be sure to order it "well done" and they'll cook the pizza a little longer than normal.
