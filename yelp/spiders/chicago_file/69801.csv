Little Goat Diner////We came in tonight for dinner.  No wait - got seated in a big booth right away, which was nice.  Really friendly service - our server was really nice and gave great recommendations and even the bussers and random people who were helping out were just very friendly.  Good timing with everything, not too hover-y.  I like that.
