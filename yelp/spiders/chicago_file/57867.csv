Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is SO YUMMY!!! Tapas style restaurant that specializes in paella. The menu here is diverse enough to find something for everyone and I have yet to have a dish that I didn't like. Some of my favorites are the dates, shaved Brussels sprouts, chicken thigh, and the potatoes bravas with tomato aioli. Fun place to get a bunch of different things and share with friends, and the sangria is good too! Love coming here when I visit Chicago. Oh also- they have breakfast tapas !
