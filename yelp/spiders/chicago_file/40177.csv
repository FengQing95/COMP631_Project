Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////What a great experience! The service here was amazing -- our waiter (Joe) was helpful, friendly and always available, but we never felt rushed. The dining room was so beautiful and relaxing. The food was absolutely delicious, and the cocktails were on point as well. We were there for three hours, and it was a perfect way to spend an evening in Chicago.
