Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love this place! The paella are all delicious! I've had the pork shoulder one, the seafood one and the vegetarian. The only thing is that I wish they would serve it on the hot plate! The dates are also excellent as are the short ribs, sausages and spicy potatoes! I love the octopus because it's super tender.
