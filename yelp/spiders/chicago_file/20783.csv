Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////SERVICE: I usually don't dedicate a separate section to write about customer service, but this time, I had to. My first problem arose when I tried to preorder a pizza. My friend was flying into Chicago late afternoon, so I knew that he would be starving. The first time I called Lou Malnati's, a worker told me that I could preorder 15 minutes prior to arriving. The second time I called, a worker told me that no one was allowed to preorder and that there was a 45 minute wait at 1:30 PM. It was very disappointing to have to tell my friend that we could not preorder our pizza, knowing that he would be starving upon arriving to the city.
