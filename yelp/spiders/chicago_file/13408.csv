Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////i also got the Classic deep dish.  i don't know if i'm really a fan of having a solid disk of sausage as part of my pie.  kind of partial to pieces.....not a huge deal though.  the crust was buttery, which was nice.  i think it was a good pie, but maybe nothing i'd travel to Chicago for.  that was a joke, since i live in SF, and that normally isn't my criteria....you know, that i would have to want to fly 1,858 miles (i looked this up) to a restaurant for it to be worthy of my 4-star rating.  the cheese was a giant glob of, uhhhh, cheese, which is how it should be.
