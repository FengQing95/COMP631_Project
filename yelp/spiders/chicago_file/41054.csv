Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We went to cafe ba-ba-reeba on a Thursday evening in December. Although we didn't have a reservation we were seated with only a 30min wait. Which wasn't too painful after sitting at the bar for a bit. Â The wait staff was pleasant enough, however they were not overly attentive to our drink orders. The food was amazing! I can honestly say this place will suit anyone! They have everything you could want in a fun and funky environment. A very young crowd (typical for this area) and a little loud at times.
