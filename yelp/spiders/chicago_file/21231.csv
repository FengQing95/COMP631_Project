Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We live near the original Lincolnwood, Illinois location. We have eaten in the restaurant and also pick up frozen pizzas to bring home. The pizza is wonderful no matter where you eat it. The sausage tends to be a bit greasy, but I prefer vegetable so It is not a problem for me. An issue with a frozen pizza bought and stored Â frozen by us for later use was replaced without question. The ambience in the restaurant is typical of an olderChicago pub-lots of dark wood and sports/entertainment industry memorabilia. There is a bar with numerous seats for those waiting for their party or their pizza, or those who just want a cocktail. Casual atmosphere and friendly, competent staff.
