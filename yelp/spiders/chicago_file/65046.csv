Smoque BBQ////The brisket was so soft that it barely stayed intact when lifting it with a fork. There was more than enough flavor where adding barbecue sauce was just to see how well it paired. I am no BBQ pit master or aficionado, but I really did enjoy the brisket a lot. The pecan bread pudding was a sleeper hit for me and my friend. We only ordered one to try and my friend took a small piece of it saying that was all he wanted. Yeah, after eating that small piece he came right back and apologized and said that he's going to have to be taking his half now. I wish I had ordered like six of them.
