Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Worth the wait! The estimated wait time can seem intimidating but we got in early anyway and it was worth it! Some of our favorites: lemon garlic dressing, trio of dips with pizza dough chips (ahhhhmazing), and of course the buttercrust! The service was friendly and efficient!
