Little Goat Diner////Server was super sweet and attentive. I ordered the okonomiyaki and has browns. Serving size is huuuuuuge. If you're eating solo - like I was - you'll be stuff before you get halfway through any of your dishes. The okonomiyaki was delicious - crispy when needed and soft when appropriate. The waitress gave me an array of hot sauces to try (I can't remember them now because it was so long ago) but they were both amazing and complimented the dish well. Hash browns were cooked to perfection and so crunchy.
