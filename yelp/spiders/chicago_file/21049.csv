Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had a few different deep dish pizzas when we were in Chicago and Lou's was good but we thought Pequod's was better.  This isn't an argument that you can ever convince anyone of though so I will leave it at that.  Our waiter here was amazing and so on top of it.  We got the The Malnati Chicago Classic and while I love sausage, I felt like it was too much and basically just a layer of sausage.  Again I still loved it hence the rating but I feel there are better.
