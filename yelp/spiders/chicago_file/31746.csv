Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered the chocolate chip cookie for dessert, which they make to order. The cookie is baked in a personal pizza pan and comes out hot and gooey, topped with 3 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and whipped cream. Perfect for sharing, but if you want one of your own we don't judge!!
