Smoque BBQ////Quite possibly the best bbq I've ever had, this far north of Georgia. GREAT delivery on all of the food. The beans are incredible. The sliced brisket is mouth watering. The ribs are so tender, you'll think the bones were stirred in for good measure. The place gets PACKED and the neighbors seem to hate the place but go! Park on Pulaski and be mindful of the parking signs. Bring beer, an IPA would go well. Go, be hungry, let the chef pick for you but DO get cornbread and extra sauce.
