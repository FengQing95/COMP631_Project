Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Review 922 (a milestone, I know) is reserved for Bavette's, the final "on the regular" Chicago review I'll write. I might sprinkle in a few more here or there as catch up, but my two years as a Chicagoland resident have come and gone. Like most ex-Chicagoans, I'll miss the city but not the city's winter. Bavette's opened its doors roughly a year before I moved to Chicago, and I quickly added it to my Yelpy bookmarks. By chance and circumstance, I never went until I was about to leave. I'm glad I squeezed it in.
