Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The seafood paella is good but not the best I have ever had. The deviled egg is pretty delish and they earned a star there. The free Yelp check in dessert was very yummy! Affogato with some sherry instead of coffee (maybe she brought us the wrong dessert?) but it was YUUUMMMMY! Two more stars for the dessert!
