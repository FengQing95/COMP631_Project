Smoque BBQ////Maybe best of all is that they will not charge you any differently if it's a wedding- I love that, wish everyone did that. They were incredibly generous with the amount of food- we had tons of leftovers and our guests were stuffed, we even canceled late night pizza delivery because everyone was still snacking on the food. They make set-up and clean-up really easy for you and seemed totally flexible in providing us with options on how exactly the flow of the service will go-they are pros so definitely take advantage of their event-planning expertise.
