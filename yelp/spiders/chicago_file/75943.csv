Little Goat Diner////Heard about this place online and wanted to try it while I was visiting Chicago. I did read that the wait times were long and when we got there around 6pm on a Friday the wait time for indoor seating was 2 hours, but luckily for us there was outdoor seating right away! The food is a fusion of American brunch and asian street food, which was a refreshing mix. I got the Japanese streetfood pancake and it tasted like a takoyaki! Would definitely come here again if I was in the area!
