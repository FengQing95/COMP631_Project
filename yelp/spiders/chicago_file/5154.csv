The Purple Pig////The wine list is a bit overwhelming. There are tons of by the glass options but no tasting notes or info about the producers. I was disappointed that they didn't have any natural or organic producers or skin contact options. Took a while to figure out what I wanted but ended up trying several: a pet nat white blend, a Lambrusco Bianco, a floral rosé and a bone dry rosé.
