Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Love this place. Chicago is known for it's steakhouses, but if you're not sure where to go (we've learned this from experience) you can set yourself up for a lot of overpriced disappointment Â You will not be disappointed here. The food is amazing, and the overall ambiance is far better than a lot of the steakhouses you might wander into while in The Loop.
