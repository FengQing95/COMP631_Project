Little Goat Diner////As I was sitting and eating, I noticed waiters/waitresses kept on approaching me and sticking their arms in front and underneath me and I heard the sound of plates. After a while, I was obliged to take a look and I saw that I was sitting on a counter beneath which they kept their dirty dishes. It didn't affect my appetite since I had already eaten the food, but the thought just kept lingering.
