Smoque BBQ////Tried to order carry out here three times now and 1. Have waited on hold for a minimum 5 minutes each time, and 2. Been told each time at least 1 hr to pickup when its a single simple order. No wonder there is a line out the door every time being they cant have a simple pickup order ready in a reasonable time.
