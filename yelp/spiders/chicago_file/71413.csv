Little Goat Diner////For the table we ordered the chili cheese fries. It was a big hit with the goat eaters. I ordered some smoked fries which didn't arrive until our mains came. I thought that was odd. I didn't get a smokey flavor from them at all. They said it was topped with Dorito dust but it tasted like a Ranch dressing packet. I would skip the plain and just sneak a few meatless fries from the chili cheese version. We also tried the fried pickles and onion rings. They were both covered in thick batter that didn't have much flavor to it. The highlight of that dish was the curry dipping sauce. It wasn't spicy at all, but had a really nice flavor to it.
