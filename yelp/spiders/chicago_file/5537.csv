The Purple Pig////We didn't have a reservation but were lucky to grab a couple of seats at the bar. I prefer that anyway because I like to be near the action sometimes and a good bartender can give make the experience so much more fun. We ordered the Ham Croquettes (I'm a mustard lover and this dish has mustard seed and a mustard aioli), the pork belly and tenderloin, and the lamb ribs. Delish! In my opinion we could've done without the ham croquettes because everything we ordered was very rich. I would have preferred the beets with goat cheese to add a little veggie to the decadent meats but I compromised.
