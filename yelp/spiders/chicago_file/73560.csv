Little Goat Diner////Our waiter seemed disinterested, but I give him props for being quick and efficient. We got our coffee quickly, except for the cappuccino, and our food came out fairly quickly as well. Three people got pancakes, one a grilled cheese, and I shared the Brandade and belly (14) and goat burger korean style (13). People were happy with their meals, and we loved the two asian inspired dishes. The goat burger was perfection. I wasn't sure if I would like goat, but I sure did! It was juicy, and everything about it was just delicious. The brandade and belly was interesting too and I was glad I got it. It was kind of like an asian eggs Benedict. They were generous with the pork belly,and it was cooked just right. The kale and kimchi went very well together too. All the portions were large, but we finished almost everything. The bill for 6 people, including coffees, came out to $100 flat, which was funny (before tip).
