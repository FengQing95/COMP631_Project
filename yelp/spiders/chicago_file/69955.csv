Little Goat Diner////Ah!! In love with this place despite how much I wanted to find something wrong with it. I just dropped in on my way to work at another restaurant in the area to grab some coffee and a bagel with schmear. The large mocha ran me about $4 but when I picked it up at the counter it had a heart in the foam. I ordered the Grump Goat bagel which has golden raisin and goat cheese. I asked the cashier to recommend a schemer and she recommended the green bean and cashew cream cheese. It was outstanding and not something I would have ordered for myself! The coffee was also perfect. I can't wait to come back and try the oatmeal and the sandwiches. They also sell a few items like a rosemary rub and several other apparel items like shirts and coffee mugs. I haven't tried the diner yet but I will be going there oh so soon. The staff is super friendly and helpful. Another winner from Izard and crew.
