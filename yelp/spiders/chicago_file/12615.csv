Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////While shopping in the area we decided to grab a pizza today.  What a disappointment.  Arriving around 1:45, the place was losing the lunch crowd.  Server informed us of the 30-40 minute wait for a thin crust pizza.  That seemed pretty silly but fine, I'm in my seat and it's raining out.  After 45 minutes, the pizza arrived to be semi-warm.  Apparently our server was more interested in the Bears game than watching for our pizza to serve it hot.  He then disappeared to never return for a beverage refill, ask of how things were or anything.  In fact, he took the order of the table immediately behind me and never looked over our way.  My husband got up to find him to pay and we went on our way.  Never coming back.  Pat's Pizza on Lincoln is 1000 times better and I'll hop in a cab and head north before stepping into another Lou Malnatti's, much less this one.  Pizza was ok due to the nice crust.  Only good thing I can say about the experience.  I should have known how it was going to go when the surly girl at the entrance desk appeared quite annoyed to be working.  I hope the manager actually reads this and takes note.  Tourists have many pizza choices in this town and as a local, I'm steering them anywhere else.
