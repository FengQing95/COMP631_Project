Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My boyfriend and I came here on the Sunday night of Memorial Day weekend. We made reservations months in advance, mind you. Love the prohibition-era feel to it, as the restaurant is actually behind the initial area you walk into when you get there. The dim-lit ambience is also very intimate - big fan.
