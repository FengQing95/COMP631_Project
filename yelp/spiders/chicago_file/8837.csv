Art Institute of Chicago////Visited: 6/27/2015 and loved it! If you love museums, this is a must visit! There was so much to see!! You could literally spend all day if you had the time! My favorite piece had to be "A Sunday on La Grande Jatte" by Georges Seurat because I finally got to see Pointillism first hand. I've tried Pointillism and it was certainly not easy, therefore, I respect this work even more! There are many treasures such as works by Renior - "Lucie Berard", "Anna Maria Dashwood" by Sir Thomas Lawrence, sculpture in bronze by Francesco Bertos - "Allegorical Group of Victory Supported by Valor", and Monet's oil on canvas works such as "Boats on the Beach at Etretat", "Rocks at Port-Goulphar, Belle-Ile". There are so many beautiful pieces of art to enjoy! Hope you get a chance to visit!
