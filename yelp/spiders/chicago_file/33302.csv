Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I'm a fan of the interior styling (downstairs bar in both Gilt and Bavettes are new favorite winter hangouts), the drinks are excellent the food is good. What's not excellent are their incompetent and rude host staff. At both Gilt and Bavette's these people go out of their way to irritate and vex anyone they encounter. They have difficulty managing the table headcount and on multiple occasions I sat next to tables empty for hours after they said they were "Just slammed all night long". Make a reservation online and hopefully you will only have to deal with these twits for the briefest of moments.
