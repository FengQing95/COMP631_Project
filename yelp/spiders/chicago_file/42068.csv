Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went here for brunch. We were seated in the bar. 6 people at a 4 person bar table. Not ideal, considering tapas serves many plates on one table. However, it was all they had so we decided to make due. We didn't have a "real" server, we had the bartender, who seemed less than enthused that he actually had to leave his post behind the bar to serve us. The service was absolutely horrible. It took forever to get our drinks and the bartender also seemed irritated that a few people ordered coffee. (Imagine that, people drink coffee for brunch?!) I know, we aren't all pounding non-stop pitchers of sangria, crazy right? Anyway, after getting the drinks, we sat for another eternity to finally order. Drinks were empty. All the while, the bartender had an entire 3 people sitting at the bar top. Oh, he was washing glasses too. I know that's important. Anyway, we continued to bother a different server for refills on our drinks. He seemed less than amused to help us, but still nice enough to oblige. Food finally arrived and was pretty decent, but not up to the standard that I had been served here 3-4 times in the past. Bacon wrapped dates were burnt and a our French toast was brought out, placed on the bar, left for 10 minutes, then retrieved and served to us as if it had not been sitting around misplaced for 10-15 minutes. Is a restaurant service position really this difficult? Ultimately, this place has really taken a dive. The bathroom was also a mess and disgusting. Terrible service on a moderately busy Sunday. Definitely will not be back. Don't waste your time.
