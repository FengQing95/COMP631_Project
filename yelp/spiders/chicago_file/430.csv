Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////We waited for 1 hour on a late Friday morning to eat here because the reviews were so impressive.  There is a nice lobby area to wait in but beware of the security guard who will watch everyone like a hawk to warn them not to sit on/touch/lean against the Christmas displays or sit on the floor, or the arm of the chairs, etc - she made everyone feel very unwelcome in the lobby.  Once we sat down the server was very friendly and helpful.  The good - fresh squeezed OJ, latte/coffee, omelettes, plain pancakes.  The not so good - pasty oatmeal, watery hot chocolate, berry bliss pancakes.  Food was decent overall but not worth the long wait.
