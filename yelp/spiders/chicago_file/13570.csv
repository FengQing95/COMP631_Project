Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Really good Pizza, what makes it is the sausage if you get it, which is one large piece that covers the entire pizza.  Some of the best I've ever had.  Beyond that though, crust and sauce are pretty average.  Restaurant location, layout, and interior are all top notch as well.
