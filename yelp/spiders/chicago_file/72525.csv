Little Goat Diner////I have now dined here four times: once when it opened back in 2013 and then three times this year alone. Also always for breakfast. Little Goat Diner is classic looking white diner with their hipster servers. I haven't had a bad meal here and have enjoyed the chicken & waffles, shrimp and cheesy grits as well as the french toast. I loved the chicken & waffles the best. Overall, if you're looking for a great breakfast spot with a wide variety of choices (I want to try the piggy went to China dish next), look no further.
