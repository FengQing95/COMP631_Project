Little Goat Diner////On my last visit, I had the pork torta. It is essentially cochinita pibil that they call "yucatan," which seemed only different in the sense of they didn't slow roast it quite the same. The waitress was totally unprepared to talk about what "yucatan" might have meant. I like it when we can have a little conversation about the taste of the dish and not just, "It's liked stewed shredded pork on a bun. Yucatan style." Hmm.
