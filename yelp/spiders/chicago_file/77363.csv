Little Goat Diner////The food here is amazing! The service is also 5 stars. We sat at the bar and the servers were so friendly. I ordered the Chicken Sandwich Â and cinnamon role. The chicken sandwich was so unique; it's got an interesting sauce and the chicken pieces are broken up which makes it easier to eat. The cinnamon role we shared amongst our group which was the perfect sweet treat.
