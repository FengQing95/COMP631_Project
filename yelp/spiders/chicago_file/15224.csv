Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Good pizza. I expected more...more flavor, more thick Chicago style crust, more sauce; All of which would have contributed to actually filling the deep dish much more than our pizza did. I enjoyed this pizza and would go again but it did not live up to its reputation as the best Chicago deep dish pizza. I love that you can put in your order while waiting to be seated, such a smart way to order!..except our server got confused by the preorder and mixed up with another preorder but a very nice option to offer non the less.
