Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////There are many pizzerias that I enjoy but Lou's has been a favorite of mine for nearly forty years. You can go into any Lou Malnati's and the quality will be consistent all around. Along with their pizzas, they also have a Thousand Island dressing that is creamy and delicious.
