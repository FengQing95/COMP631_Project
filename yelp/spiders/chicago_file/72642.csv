Little Goat Diner////First time visit little goat this Friday was because girl and the goat need to wait over 3 hours however little goat only need to wait like 40 mins...tried shrimp and grit+duck chest and other sneak of fried onion. Have to said duck chest is awesome!! Very tender yet have crispy crust, with Vigi in the bottom. It's wonderful! On the contrary, shrimp and grit is a little too sour because tons of tomato and cheese! In the fist 10 mins I thought it's amazing! Very testy! Yet I can not finish the bowl in the end...
