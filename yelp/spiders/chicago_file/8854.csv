Art Institute of Chicago////Would have given this 5 stars before having gone to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC. That is a real museum, full of artwork from artists you recognize. It's also HUGE. This place tries to charge $25 if you're from out of state, whereas in NYC, you can pay whatever you want. I never thought that I would ever say that Chicago is a greedier place than NYC.
