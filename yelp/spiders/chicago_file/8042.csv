Art Institute of Chicago////I was not that impressed with the collection in this museum. It could definitely work on its impressionist and classical collections. The miniatures room however was a great exhibit, combining superb craftmanship with a glimpse into the lives of very rich, old families. Â The museum is still a must for any visit to Chicago. I was however disappointed that the textiles were not on display during my visit.
