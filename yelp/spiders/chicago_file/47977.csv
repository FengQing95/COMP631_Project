Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This spot is in residential neighborhood on a street with some solid competition.  I went with friends and couldn't have chosen a better spot.  This is the ultimate place for group dining / going on a date or just people watching.  It doesn't look like a big place but it has lots of space.  If possible ask if you can sit in the atrium area.  As the sun sets the lights come to a smooth dimly lit tone and.....voila.....sexy time ambiance.
