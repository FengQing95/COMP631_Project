Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Their pizza is amazing. 'nuff said. The deep dish cheese and spinach is what I live for. The best feeling ever is when the waiter takes a slice of pizza from the whole pie and he has to cut the cheese because it is literally stuck to the entire pizza because there is so much cheese. Yes. just yes.
