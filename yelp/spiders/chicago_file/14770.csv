Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm not sure which location I went to last year, nor do I know the exact name of the pizza I ordered (some basic one). I just know I've always hated deep dish pizzas until I took my first bite here! One of the best pizzas I've had in my life. You know your stuff is good when you've got tourists yearning for your food long after their gone! Do yourself a favor and GO.
