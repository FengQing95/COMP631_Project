Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was a little surprised that they only had 3 pizzas on the menu. We got the sausage and it was ok. Not great, not terrible. I thought the crust was okay and then there was an entire sausage patty then cheese and sauce. I thought the sausage was just alright and was a little disappointed.
