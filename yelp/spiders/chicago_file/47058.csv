Smoque BBQ////My boss had a taste for BBQ so when that happens, I head to Smoque.  Plus I had a $25 gift card from them because they forgot a couple of coleslaws on a $100 order!  How's that for customer service/appreciation!!  Anyway, I got my usual half and half platter of pulled pork and slice brisket.  5 incredibly thick, tender slices of brisket and a huge pile of pulled pork with sides of beans and slaw.  Outstanding!!  My boss and another coworker had half slab of baby back rib dinners and I didn't hear any complaints coming from the conference room so I'll take that they enjoyed their lunch!  Good job Smoque!  See you soon!!!
