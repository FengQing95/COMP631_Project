Little Goat Diner////Dessert: Our super fun and kind waitress hooked the bday girl up with a little shake (on the house) for her special day. How cute right!? We also ordered the turtle pie to split...which came with a birthday candle and all:) DAMN, this was OUT OF THIS WORLD! If you LOVE carmel, then go to Little Goat this very second and order the turtle pie. oooweeee. Â
