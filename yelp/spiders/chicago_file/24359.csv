Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////There's a reason Lou Mal's is synonymous with Chicago pizza. Yes, you'll wait forty five minutes to an hour, but then you will receive a pizza the likes of which you will eat nowhere else in the world (except another Lou Mal's, obvs.) Crunchy butter crust, squeaky fresh mozzarella, and perfectly seasoned tomatoes plus your topping of choice. The sausage and pepperoni and spinach and mushroom are family favorites, but honestly you could put anything on these pies and they'd be delicious.
