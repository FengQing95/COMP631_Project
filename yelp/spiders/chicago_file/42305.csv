Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tapas are Spanish small bites. Right? Well CAfe Ba-Ba-Reeba introduces to the world the Tapas pintxos or small tapas! A bite of food for $1.50. Who knew? They were tasty but had nothing Spanish to them. And I guess that is my main complain about the place. They try to give a Spanish twist to everything but it's not. Chorizo and dates with plantains? Ahi Tuna? not sure....
