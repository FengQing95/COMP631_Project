Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////hate to say it, but we had a not so good experience. The place was freezing, which didn't help. The staff is good except we waited forever for bread and drink orders. My daughter ordered a rib eye steak to be cooked medium. It was served to her raw in the middle as well as my husbands steak. We had them sent back to be refired. My daughters came back still raw in the middle like they forgot to re cook it. The manager insisted we not pay for it. I have to say, for $70 the steak should be awesome. It was far from it, even flavor was lacking. My salmon was just ok. a bit dry and under seasoned. Â The elote corn was not what I was expecting. I was expecting it to have flavors like street corn, which is what the description indicates, but it came to the table with a very strange bright orange color overly rich. Mashed potatoes are great and dessert is ok as well. we had the chocolate pie. atmosphere is good and drinks are good, once you finally get them. The food is just ok and I wont go out of my way to go back.
