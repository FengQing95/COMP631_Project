Smoque BBQ////The food was totally AWESOME!!!! We both had the Baby Back Rib entree (1/2 slab) and 2 sides (French fries, baked beans, mac & cheese, and corn bread). All entrees are served with coleslaw. We also had a "taste" of pulled pork and chopped brisket. Don't laugh, but we like to try as much as possible. We did skip the peach cobbler which I regretted later. :)
