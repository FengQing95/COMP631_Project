Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food was seriously AMAZING. We started off with the shrimp and this by far was the best shrimp I have ever had. It was served with a bold garlic sauce and bread. That could have been an entree on its own. Following, we ordered dry aged steak, rotisserie chicken, mashed potatoes, street corn, and truffle mac n cheese. Everything literally had us humming. The food was something we have never tasted before very bold in flavor, seasoned well, and cooked to perfection. The portions were also huge. We had tons of leftovers which warmed up great the next day! I cannot wait to get back here! From the attentive service to the absolute amazing food I highly recommend.
