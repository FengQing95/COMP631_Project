Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time trying Chicago deep dish. Went in for lunch on a Wednesday and grabbed a seat at the bar. It was early (11:15am) so no crowd yet. Took the bar tenders suggestion and ordered the classic (deep dish with sausage).  He said it would take 30 minutes and it took 45. No big deal but certainly feels like a long time when you're anticipating pizza.  The pizza itself was good. Not bad at all. If I was at home in Cali I would say pretty good deep dish. The only reason I can't give five starts is because it was a little greasy and didn't blow my socks off. I still have to try the other so called "best deep dish in chicago" before I can really make a fair comparison. But it's worth trying for sure!
