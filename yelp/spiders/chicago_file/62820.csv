Smoque BBQ////With that friendly neighborhood greeting, we walked into Smoque. It's nothing special to look at on the outside, and not much better inside. There's a wall-covering blackboard with the menu, but it's starting to fade out, making it hard for noobs like us to decipher. Fortunately, my brother is a regular here, so I didn't need the menu.
