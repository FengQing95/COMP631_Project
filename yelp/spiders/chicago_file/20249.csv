Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I had a very hard decision to make between here and Giordano's, and I'm ultimately glad I chose to come here. I loaded my pizza with veggies and sausage... twas amazing! Even the salad was delicious. The only drawback here was the service which I found to be a bit on the slow side.  great for any  occasion, plenty of seating and menu options.
