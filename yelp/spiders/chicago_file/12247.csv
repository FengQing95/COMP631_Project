Art Institute of Chicago////Impressionism lives on in this gem. So much of it. Monet, my favorite painter of all time, has an entire section to his work. This made me quite deliriously happy, especially considering that some of his work I was able to recognize in terms of location. It's amazing how traveling and art can expand your perspective, but I digress.
