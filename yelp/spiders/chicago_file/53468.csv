Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I came here on a Friday night with my family for dinner and the restaurant was PACKED. I definitely recommend making reservations ahead of time. We were super hungry when we got there so we started ordering haphazardly. However, we totally missed out on the paella (it takes about 30 minutes to make and we were halfway through our meal before we made that realization). Don't forget to check-in on Yelp--you get a free dessert tapa. :D
