Little Goat Diner////I was a little hesitant to order it, but decided to go forward anyway when the waitress assured me Japanese customers confirmed it was authentic. Pleasantly surprised when it came with little Tempura crunches on top. It was very tasty and I could not figure out what it reminded me of, until it struck me--It tasted exactly like the fried dough of takoyaki (fried batter with octopus in the middle minus the octopus)
