Little Goat Diner////I've only been here once and really it wasn't enough to form a well rounded opinion. Their menu selection is wide and very unique. We went for dinner and the food was super rich and amazing. We both had the pork loin and it was something else...so rich that I couldn't finish it, which is definitely not my usual MO. My girl can't have dairy and they were very accommodating. The waitress made a mistake on our order so she included desert for free. I had the pork toffee shake but honestly it was nothing special. I definitely want to try out their breakfast selection so I'll be back!
