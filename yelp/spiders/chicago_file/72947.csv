Little Goat Diner////Amazing hipster gastropub spot. Seriously great food, great cocktails, great ambience, and priced well. They have a lot of neat stuff on the menu, a lot of pork belly, and goat dishes, as well as some fun interpretations on comfort food as well as breakfast. You need to check this place out!
