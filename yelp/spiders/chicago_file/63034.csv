Smoque BBQ////Maybe we went on a bad day, but boy oh boy were we ever disappointed. Everything was dry... the cornbread, the bread on the sandwiches, the brisket, the pork. The tea (something I consider a staple to BBQ) was absolutely terrible. The BBQ sauce was really runny, straight liquid, basically vinegar. The meats both had a smoky flavor, which was the only plus of this place. Overall, a disgrace to the world of bbq!
