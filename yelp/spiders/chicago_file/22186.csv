Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was looking forward to a "deep dish." I believe the New York Sicilian slice was deep than this one. It didnt compare to what I saw on the food network specials on deep dish places in Chicago. Definitely didnt match my expectations of this place. It reminded me of another chain company that is trying to appeal to the general public.
