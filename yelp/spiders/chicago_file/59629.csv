Smoque BBQ////Mac&Cheese: I have to preface this by saying I'm not a big mac&cheese kinda guy. I never did the blue box stuff growing up, so cheese covered macaroni doesn't really bring up childhood memories. The mac&cheese here is baked and adequate, which is about as good as mac&cheese gets for me.
