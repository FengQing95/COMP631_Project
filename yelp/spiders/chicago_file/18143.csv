Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////About a month before leaving for Chicago I started to ask some natives in my hometown for their recommendation on the best pizza in Chicago. The only other time we were in the Windy City we were told to go to Uno and we were sorely disappointed. It left the proverbial bad taste in our mouth (pun intended!). Out of a dozen friends, 10 said to try Lou Malnati's. One of the locations was just 3 blocks from our hotel so off we went. The restaurant had a 90-minute wait so we decided to take out. We ordered the Lou Malnati and they had me from the first bite. Our pizza was easily the freshest and most savory I've ever had. The crust melted in your mouth and the toppings tasted as if they had been harvested in the previous hour. Pair it with a Caesar salad and 10 out of 12 former Chicagoans were dead solid perfect in their recommendation.
