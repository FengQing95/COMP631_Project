Little Goat Diner////So back to business, Miss Stephanie Izzard's hipsters tell me when they were over for "special vodka nite" at my place to expect an unexpected experience....   I never quite understood "special vodka night" meant until tonight when someone finally gave me the vodka pasta along with a special Finnish Fish side dish.    I mean, how does one make Vodka infused pasta anyway?  There's no vodka in there.  It must have been leftover Zima malt beverage from 1995.   Gosh I don't think all of that made total sense and may have been a bit out of sequence.
