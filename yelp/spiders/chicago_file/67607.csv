Little Goat Diner////Had the ham, egg and cheese Namlette.  Nan-like bread was delicious.  The scrambled egg was well-cooked, but under-seasoned.  Walk-up service at 7:15 am on a Tuesday was slow and not very attentive, which was the biggest disappointment and the reason for two stars.  The wait for the sandwich from the time I ordered was 15 minutes.
