Smoque BBQ////I had the sliced Brisket platter with two sides, Mac and Cheese and Fries. The lady at the counter said those were the two most popular. I also had the bread pudding. The Brisket was divine. It was good with the thinner of the two BBQ sauces. Although, mind not to use too much. The meat needs to carry the flavor. The Mac and cheese was really good with a nice crust on top. The fries were not bad. Perhaps because I had so much food they didn't stand out. The slaw was good, but I could eat much of it because I wanted to save room for the Bread Pudding. It was more bread than pudding, but it was incredible! This is a must try.
