Little Goat Diner////At the diner, we had the "los drowned" beef sandwich, and the "tonkatsu" asian inspired pork sandwich, both left us wanting more flavor.  The tonkatsu, being the less pleasing of the two, didn't taste like anything, and was on pretty lackluster white bread.   At least the beef tasted beefy, but it was a big fat greasy mess with few high notes.  The fried pickles and onions were lacking, especially the pickles, which got lost in the tempura style batter, luckily the dipping sauces were tasty.  For dessert, the smoked pork and toffee crunch shake was awfully thin, leaving the solid candy bits sinking to the bottom.  The whipped cream on top was nothing special.  The menu is large, and few restaurants can execute a large menu well, so maybe these dishes are not the best, but then they should be removed and/or replaced.  The ancient ale from Dogfish head was very good.  The restaurant was quite loud, and conversation became fatiguing through the din.
