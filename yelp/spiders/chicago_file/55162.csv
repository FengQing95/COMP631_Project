Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been many Tapas bars from Coast to Coast. But I must say that the food at Cafe BaBa Reeba was one of the best experiences I have had in the US. The staff was amazing, customer service was great. The Tapas were delicious nothing we ordered was given back. We cleared our plates. The sangria was delicious as well. We drove an hour and a half to test this place out and they didn't disappoint. Great place for kids.
