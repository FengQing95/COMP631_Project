Smoque BBQ////Pretty good ribs and brisket.  Not the best if you compare it with St Louis places like pappy's.  I got half rack of st louis ribs and a serving of brisket.  The brisket had a nice smoke ring to it and was very tender, the ribs were tender as well but a bit on the small side for st louis ribs.  Still great for BBQ in the middle of Chicago.
