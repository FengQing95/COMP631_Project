Little Goat Diner////We got there and were seated right away at our booth. The coffee is delicious and I love the enormous heavy coffee mugs with their little goat painted inside. The breakfast selections are not infinite but made up an entire page of the menu. The selections seem to go one of two ways: perfectly ordinary, or so wacky I can't imagine eating it. For instance, the "brandade and belly" caught my eye because I love, love, love pork belly - but a quick google search of what "brandade" is and I was too weirded out to try it. I settled on the spiced apple pancakes, one friend got the dark chocolate crunch pancakes, and the friend with celiac opted for the gluten-free pancakes from the gluten-free menu. Our server paused and said she may not be able to have those, because they tend to sell out quick, so she'd run and check and come back. Okay, fair. Â 5 minutes later she came back and advised yes, they do have them - BUT, was she gluten-free or actually celiac? When my friend advised she does actually have celiac's disease, our server told us she would not be able to eat these pancakes, because of cross-contamination.
