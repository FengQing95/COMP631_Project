Little Goat Diner////Before I arrived, I knew I was going to go with Pancakes or a Burger. I teetered about 7 times before making my decision. To clear my head, I decided to place an order for the Goat Chili. It came served with cheddar cheese, sour cream, jalepenos, and pizza 'poofs,' which were pizza flavored croutons, in essence. The chili was quite small in size, but it was my favorite part of the meal. I had never tried goat, but I could definitely tell the difference from beef. As usual with exotic meats, it was a bit gamier. I really enjoyed it. The jalepenos were a bit sweet, which I enjoyed, because I'm not a huge spicy guy. I like some kick, and these fit the bill.
