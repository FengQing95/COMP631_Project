Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////With much hype and anticipation, I had to try Lou Malnati's when I visited Chicago. Sorry to say... I was sadly disappointed. Words of the buttered crust wasn't true and the pizza was practically bland. I really wanted to like this place, with its awesome location and outdoor seating, but I just can't. Honestly, I've had better Chicago style pizza in California. :(
