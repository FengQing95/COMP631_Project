Little Goat Diner////The wait to get is is typically long so an Open Table reservation is strongly recommended.  If you plan on talking to anyone while dining, go some place else.  The noise level is off the chart.  Loud music which forces everyone to talk louder makes this unfavorable for my taste.  The staff is aware but no attempt to turn down the music was made.
