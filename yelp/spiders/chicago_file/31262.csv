Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Overall, our experience was good and we enjoyed most of it. I would question the flavor of the crust quite a bit, but everything else was decent. We wouldn't hesitate to return, but next time might order a take out pizza so that we can ensure the crust is flavored or add flavoring at home.
