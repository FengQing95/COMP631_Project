Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Food was beyond fantastic, one of the best meals ever enjoyed in Chicago... service was meh at best.  Waiter was so new he literally thanked us for coming to his last restaurant by name.  He tried to fudge it when he didn't know the drink contents.  Worst off, the main course took 1h40m to arrive and our waiter disappeared after the main course, the bus boy provided the check and end of the meal thanks.  Not at all a complement to the excellent meal, he was obviously poorly trained as the service was abysmal and his knowledge of the menu to help inform options was even worse... bummer as we had such high expectations.
