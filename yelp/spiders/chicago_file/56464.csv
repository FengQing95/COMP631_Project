Smoque BBQ////We went there on a Friday evening for pick up and, unlike the first time, didn't even have to wait in a line.  We walked up to the counter, grabbed two paper menus (as the chalkboard menu gives my eyes hell) and stepped to the side.  About 3 minutes later, we were approached by one of the employees who asked us if we had any questions and, upon our decline, politely excused himself but made sure to tell us where we could find him if we changed our mind.
