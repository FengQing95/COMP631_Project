Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Wow.  Best steakhouse dinner I have ever had and most expensive!  Mind you, I have been to plenty of NYC houses that weren't as pricey.  But nevermind that.  The meal.  Wow.  The steak was perfectly tender and full flavored.  The bread was delicious.  The Mac and cheese was amazing.
