Art Institute of Chicago////So much great art here. I would have to say that the entry cost is a bit high, though. Thus I am leaving a four star review. I also wish this venue was open later on the weekends, 5pm close time is early on a Saturday! The venue is very clean and well staffed. I will definitely return but the cost hurts my pocket book. I think more business would turn this way given the right price.
