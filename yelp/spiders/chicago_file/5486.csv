The Purple Pig////Holy smokes was this place delicious! It over exceeding my expectations. I ordered their octopus with green beans, fingerlings potatoes and green salsa. Literally the best grilled octopus I've had in my life! It was perfectly cooked not chewy and the flavors were amazing. I literally had a foodgasm. I also ordered their roasted bone marrow with herbs. Wow! That little lemony salad was the perfect balance to garnish on top of the bread w/ the bone marrow. My mouth is watering thinking about this dish as well. Customer service was fantastic one of the bartenders made made sure I was well taken care even with the high volume. The bar area is first come first serve so be prepared to wait a bit. This is a must if you come to Chicago!
