Little Goat Diner////My husband and I wanted to try a semi-nice meal while we were in Chicago with our newborn baby (we knew we had to opt out of fancy establishments since they're not baby-friendly) - I found this place on Yelp near our hotel and we made our way here for dinner one night. We walked in without a reservation and luckily we landed a table in the back (we arrived early but the place was already super packed with a line of people after us!).
