Smoque BBQ////I was also surprised to find that it was not a sit-down, table service kind of place... I guess the fans who raved about it left that part out? There is no beer either. My expectation was to come, sit down, order a beer, have some mind blowing BBQ brought out to me... and I didn't get that at all.
