Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////* Crab Stuffed Avocado salad. This was also a hit but I think slightly less so than the whitefish salad. The crab was good, not great. It was stuffed into a half avocado and served with plain lettuce. It was good, and easy to eat. I don't know if this blows my socks off or anything. But it was a quality dish that I enjoyed. Andy made comment that it seems like more and more places deconstruct the meals these days and you end up having to mix it up yourself. I agree, though I don't know if I object to the practice or not. It is what it is, I guess.
