Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Unbelievably delicious! The ambiance is so cool; it's this stellar speak-easy vibe. They even have a bar downstairs which reminds me of an Al Capone-esc hideout. The drink menu is awesome but the food really steals the show. The steaks are huge, well-seasoned and wonderful. I think it's safe to say Bavette's trumps David Burke's (sorry! Burke's is good but their quality has gone down over the years and Bavette's is divine!). Thick cut bacon appetizers are a great way to start the meal and whiskey ice cream is a lovely way to finish it. You can tell all the food is fresh. The staff is super knowledgeable and friendly. Bavette's is a must go!
