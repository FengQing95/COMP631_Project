Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////One of our friends, Chip, kinda recognized the name, but not entirely... because if you say Lou Minalti's fast it doesn't sound like it's a person's name... let alone 2 separate words. When he recognized the logo, he said, "oh this is Lou Malnati's" I've had this before... it's amazing!" yea yea, tell me something I don't know Chip... the wait was too long so we just went next door for some bar food... kinda sucks when you're so close! but yet so far!....
