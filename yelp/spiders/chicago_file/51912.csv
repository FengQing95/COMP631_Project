Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The Buttermilk-Fried Chicken Thighs, Piri-Piri Sauce & Shaved Vegetable Salad, was DISGUSTING!!!!! It was a plate of soggy, greasy, balls of the chicken thighs. I don't understand why this dish wasn't made to order. They obviously fried a ton of battered chicken thighs all at once and then just let them sit underneath a heat lamp. They were HORRIBLE!
