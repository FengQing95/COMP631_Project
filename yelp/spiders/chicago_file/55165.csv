Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We've ordered the tuna special: raw tuna, which was very delicate and fresh. The lamb special with a warm puree underneath was perfectly cooked and tasted amazing. We've also ordered the shishito peppers, which are really hard to find, but they were chargrilled to perfection and served with a little salt on top: so good. The dates wrapped in bacon are a classic, and it did taste just like I remember it from Spain. While we were pretty full after that we still decided to order desserts, and they were just the perfect size: the flan was the right texture and tasted really good, but my favorite was the cheesecake, which reminded me of the way my mom would make it, with quark, instead of cream cheese. It was soo good I wish I had a whole pie of this cheesecake.
