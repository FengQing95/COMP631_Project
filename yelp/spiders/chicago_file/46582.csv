Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Was told it would be a 10 minute wait. It took over an hour to be seated. Over priced and not that good. The sangria was good.. And the tapas were good. Although, the mashed potatoes tasted boxed. The paella was not good at all. I got the pork one. Tasted like pork very singular and dry and not flavorful. Very greasy and not good if you get acid reflux. Â I'd rather eat Chinese take out at least it's cheap and would meet my expectations of being bad.
