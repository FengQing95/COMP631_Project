Little Goat Diner////I ordered the mac and cheese.  It was a good balance of of cheese to pasta shells ratio (which any serious mac-&-cheese lover can attest is a very delicate and hard science to balance).  I don't know if it was worth $9 at a "diner".  But there certainly was a good serving amount to be shared by two...oh wait.  It is Mac-&-cheese!   I didn't share!
