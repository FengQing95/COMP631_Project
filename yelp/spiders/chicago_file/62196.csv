Smoque BBQ////I have dined at Smoque BBQ on a couple of occasions.  The beef brisket is amazing.  Perhaps as delicious as some of my favorite Missouri BBQ restaurants.  The St. Louis ribs are prepared to perfection.  Each bite is filled with tender and easy to pull pork from the bone.  The smokey flavor of the ribs makes the overall experience more satisfying.  My only hiccup is the BBQ sauce.  The sauce is mediocre at best.  The sauce does not seem to enhance the outstanding flavor of the ribs.  I ate most of my ribs without the sauce for that reason.  I would recommend for the owners to sample the BBQ sauces featured at some of the better rib joints in the country and add those sauces to their restaurant.  Also, once the sauce is improved, have bottles of the sauce on each table.  Pouring bbq sauce on brisket or ribs from a small plastic cup takes away from the overall BBQ experience.
