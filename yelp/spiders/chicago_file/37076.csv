Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The warm bread and butter to start off the dinner was quite good as was the list of craft cocktails and craft beer. For a Â starter, I shared the lettuce with the thick slices of bacon (excellent). My friend ordered the ribeye, which he said was as good as Chicago Cut. I ordered the chicken (not fried), which was moist on the inside and had nice, crispy skin on the outside--excellent dish. For a side, we chose the elote style corn which was out of this world.
