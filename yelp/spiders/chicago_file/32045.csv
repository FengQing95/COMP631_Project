Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ordered stuffed pizza with sausage, peppers, and onions. Overall, was quite good, but I'd probably get it in traditional deep dish format rather than as a stuffed pizza next time. Was here with 3 others; had a medium pizza, which we did not finish. Others in the party (from NYC) hated the stuffed pizza so they had like half a slice, meaning there were lots of leftovers. Overall, I think this is a bit better than Uno...Want to try Pequod's next time.
