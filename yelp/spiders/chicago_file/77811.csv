Little Goat Diner////First of all, the decor and atmosphere is so perfect. I love the vibe of this diner! My group sat at a shared table with no wait, but the place was so packed. There are so many options on the menu and coming here for a late lunch, we were starving. My family ordered The Fat Club, The Tonkatsu, and the Goat Chili. Everything was so delicious and the portion sizes are huge. As busy as it as, the service was still excellent. We never had to wait for anyone to come to our table. I would highly recommend paying a visit to Little Goat Diner. You won't leave hungry or unsatisfied.
