Art Institute of Chicago////I am so impressed by this museum!  It was definitely worth the 15 min walk in subzero weather.   I'm just sad I couldn't stay longer and spend ample time in all the exhibits.  This place is enormous!  The museum has a spectacular impressionist gallery and if you're in a pinch for time, it's a must see (along with Seurat's A Sunday Afternoon and Wood's American Gothic). I was also blown away by their extensive Asian art exhibit.
