Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband and I went to Bavette's March 15th for my bday. When making our reservation we requested the lower level for dinner. They kindly said they will try to accommodate. When we get there the ladies at check in wished me a happy bday and sat us right away in the lower level.  Our server was Joel and he has a great personality with tons of smiles. I have a gluten sensitivity and he gave me plenty of options. I ordered the bone marrow and had it with their apple cider vinegar chips. It was my first time trying the bone marrow but heard good things about it at Bavette's and other places, but it wasn't for me. The chips were really good tho. We also ordered the shrimp scampi, Cesar salad (with the chips instead of croutons) and elote style corn to start. All was amazing! My main dish was the petite filet mignon with oscar style crab and my husband had the burger.  My steak was so tender and the crab was an expensive add on but worth it. My husband's burger is LITERALLY the Au Chavel burger to the T - simply amazing!!  For the cherry on top they gifted dessert! We had the ice cream sunday and chocolate cream pie and it was all very good.
