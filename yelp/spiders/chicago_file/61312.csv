Smoque BBQ////Edit: I'm going to put two stars back for excellent customer service (the rating I would've given the place if I hadn't felt sick after eating there). Barry wrote me today asking for a chance to make this right and comp my order. I'm willing to do so, to see if I like some of the other items on the menu and in the hopes that this bad experience was an isolated incident. Either way, I'll write another review about my experience when I come back.
