Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For my main course, I ordered the steak frites (with a side of creamed spinach, my favorite steakhouse staple).  After what was another eternity (it took 2.5 hours for us to be served and eat 2 courses), our food finally arrived. I had asked for my steak to be prepared medium-rare, although it was probably closer to medium.  The steak itself was an okay cut, still tender given that it was cooked more than I would have liked, but it was just that: fine and average.
