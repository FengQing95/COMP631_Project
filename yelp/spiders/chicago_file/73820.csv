Little Goat Diner////The nice surprise was parking was a plenty and free! Walked in, gave our name and phone number and headed to the washroom. I counted about six empty tables so while there probably was a good reason for the wait, the perception was...why exactly do we have to wait 20 minutes during my hour long lunch break? Side note, big fan of the wall papered doors and hand dryers in the bathrooms.
