Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The decor is very rustic and spanish cafe inspired....a person feels like they're in a street in Sevilla when they're in this restaurant.  I'm a little surprised to read that someone thought the bathrooms were dirty...I am a germaphobe to the extreme (I carry 4 things with me at all times: wallet, chapstick, keys, and purell), and I think the bathrooms are fine.  I think the person is confusing the decor with bacteria.
