Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute of Chicago is and always will be one of my very favorite museums in the country.  A bit more manageable than the Met, while still expansive enough to take up as much time as you need it to.  The Impressionist Gallery and the miniature rooms are two of my favorite places to spend a few hours.
