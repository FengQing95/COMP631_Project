Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This place was only a 6 min walk from my hotel so my friend and I decided to try it and we were so glad we did. We did have a little bit of a wait but nothing unbearable, maybe 15 minutes. Once inside, we were astonished by the size of the menu BUT our waiter was amazing. He quickly gave us recommendation from lattes to pancakes to omelettes. It really helped us make our choice. The food arrived quickly and it was delicious! Our waiter really made our experience great and we both said multiple times we never wanted to leave. I only wish we were in Chicago longer to go more than once on our trip! My advice is GO HERE. It's by far worth any wait.
