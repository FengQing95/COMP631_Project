The Purple Pig////I was under the impression that this place served small tapas and plates but everything I ordered was bigger than expected. We expected a long wait and were told over the phone that the wait could be 2-4 hours during the dinner hour so we decided to come at around 10pm to avoid the wait. We still had to wait for a table but we were given the option of ordering from the full menu and eating at the outside patio if we wanted. We decided to stand around a table outside and order from the menu (no seats but we didn't mind standing and eating since the table was tall). Eventually, by the time we figured out what to get, we did end up getting seated inside.
