Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute does have some viscera in the form of relics which I visited out of a sense of duty, because they are so far from where they belong. I stroked the head of a bronze Joan of Arc in the children's section- she was there as part of an exhibit for the blind. All the titles were in braille. And I joined my daughter in contempt about an altar set from the 15th century, we both agreed belonged at our church.
