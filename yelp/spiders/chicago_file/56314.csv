Smoque BBQ////We went here when celebrating a co-workers birthday. Naturally, I'm the only vegetarian so I was left with very, very few options. I ordered sides (which are the size of a baby food jar), so I had all these little tin foil containers in front of me. I got the slaw, mac N cheese and cornbread.
