Little Goat Diner////We expected so much more from this place to be truthful. It was very loud with the music blasting that I had to put my ear plugs on and almost shout for my party of six to hear me. Service was fairly slow and we were trying to figure out who our waitress or waitress was for our table. The food portions were way to big . It was like an order could feed three or four people. The food was average . We wouldn't come here again.
