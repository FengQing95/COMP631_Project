Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I made a reservation for two people on a Thursday at 8pm with OpenTable. Due to an eventful uber ride to the restaurant, I called the restaurant to push back the time with no issue. Upon arrival, the hostess greeted us and informed us that our table would be set up shortly and invited us to enjoy a drink at the bar. The restaurant itself has a great atmosphere thanks to the decor, and level of light. At the bar, my friend and I both ordered a Belle Meade Old Fashioned. In my opinion, I think the Old Fashioneds at Bavette's, Gilt Bar, and The Library are the best I've ever had. I also appreciated the insight of the bartenders on their cocktail and whiskey selections. After a few minutes, we were taken to our table where our waiter greeted us immediately and provided waters. He also took the bottle of champagne with us and placed it immediately on ice before guiding us through the menu and giving suggestions. After a few minutes of perusing the menu, we decided on the Maude's Tower, baked crab cake, steak tartare, grilled asparagus, and filet mignon to split (for 2 - yes - this was a long overdue celebratory dinner). When our waiter returned, we placed the full order and he told us he would pace it out (a gesture we greatly appreciated). By the time we finished our drinks from the bar, he opened our chilled bottle of champagne and poured us each a glass. The food then came out in the following order, which I will use to review the items.
