Smoque BBQ////After hitting up another "best bbq place in Texas" I felt obligated to write a review for Smoque. With a humble sense of objectivity, Smoque just might be the best bbq in America. This past year I've had "the best" in KC, Graceland & Texas - all notorious for excellent bbq. The quality and consistency of Smoque is surprising. Last week after being directed to the best bbq in San Antonio -and confirming its 4.5 star rating on Yelp- I was ashamed to say Smoque does Texas bbq better than Texas, way better. The meats and sauces are amazing, but the selling point for me is the sides. Best beans I've ever had. Great fries. Hearty slaw, etc. And to top it off, Smoque is by far the best in presentation. Bbq places tend to have a hole-in-a-wall appeal and presentation (which I love). Smoque retains that sense of "grub" while highlighting the quality of their food with quality presentation.
