Little Goat Diner////Being quite a fan of chef Izard I was disappointed about our meal at Little Goat. Don't get me wrong - the food is not bad by any means, and the dishes brought me a very comfortable feeling. But that's the problem, nothing we tried were great or special or memorable. It's like some good dishes that a good home cook can pull off. If Little Goat was a little place in my neighborhood where I can stop by anytime, sure I would visit it again. But having to wait 1.5 hours to be seated in a very packed restaurant in an area with a lot of other great choices, I don't think I feel the need to come back.
