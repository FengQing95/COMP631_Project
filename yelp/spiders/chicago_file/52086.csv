Smoque BBQ////My boyfriend had to try the place before we left. I thought the food was pretty good. I loved the peach cobbler. The meat was pretty good off the ribs. We had two kinds and it came off pretty easy. The tri-tip wasn't that great to me. It needed sauce. I'm not a big BBQ fan, but saw tasted it so at least I've had it. The owner seemed cool.
