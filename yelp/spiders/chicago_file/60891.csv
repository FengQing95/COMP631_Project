Smoque BBQ////As per usual they were out of something, tonight it was the chicken. I don't mind waiting for good food, but there's a problem when it's so crowded that you can't even get in the place to get to the counter to place a to go order. I'm glad I didn't place an order by phone, because I'd have to ask people to get me up front as if I were in a mosh pit.
