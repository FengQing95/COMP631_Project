Little Goat Diner////I've never been disappointed by my food here. I love that their full menu is available all day. I like the cinnamon bun and I don't even like cinnamon buns! It's gigantic, so plan to share! The kimchi on their Reuben is delicious. Make a reservation if you're coming for brunch... well, you should probably have a reservation anytime, I've only been to brunch :)
