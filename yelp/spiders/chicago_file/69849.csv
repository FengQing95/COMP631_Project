Little Goat Diner////Took us awhile to get seated, but the service wasn't bad considering how busy they were.  However, once we got our food,  it quickly explained why so many people come here. The nachos were fantastic, and I really enjoyed my goat burger. I'd say it was worth the general hassles of the city.
