Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////They screwed up my reservation. I arrived, checked in, was directed to the bar to have a cocktail and await my table. I ordered a Cognac Sazerac and hated it. It wasn't anyone's fault but mine. Just a poor choice for me. The barkeep whisked it away and replaced it with my second choice; a French 75. I happily sipped my delightfully potent drink and felt myself slip into the atmosphere. It's a blend of French bistro and speakeasy, but not too heavy on either often way overdone genre.
