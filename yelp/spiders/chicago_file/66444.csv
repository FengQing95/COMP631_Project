Little Goat Diner////My friend and I ended up splitting the Horseshoe style goat burger and the Parathas Burrito.  The burger was out of control.  I'd highly recommend the goat chili (which came piled on top of the burger!).  The burrito ended up being less exciting (and why I ultimately gave Little Goat a 4 star rating after all).  It was missing some sauce/maybe meat action, but these are the restaurant's early days so I'm going easy on them.  Overall it seems like one should stick to the hearty, indulgent food on the menu- boy do they have meat and fried figured out.  I'll definitely be coming back! So many other delicious sounding items to try!
