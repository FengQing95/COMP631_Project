Little Goat Diner////We brought a party of 10 here for dinner on a Tuesday night at 8 o'clock which was the only time we could get a reservation. The air conditioning was inadequate and it was way too warm for me to enjoy my meal. It was a very noisy restaurant and we could not even Carry on conversation at our table with the person right next to you.  The menu was interesting and the food was good and priced fairly.  Goat tastes like beef.
