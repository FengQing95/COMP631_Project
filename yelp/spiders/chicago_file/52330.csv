Smoque BBQ////Went here for Valentines day on a date night. And if you are thinking that stuffing yourself silly with pork and side items is as romantic as it sounds. You are absolutely correct.....They were running a special of full rack of ribs and 2 sides for like 18$ I believe. I decided to go big and get this with 2 sides and a extra side of cornbread and a side of some bread pudding concoction they were serving up. The ribs were some of the best I've ever had and it was indeed a full rack. Kinda looked like two racks of ribs stacked on top of each other to be honest. The meals come out on aluminum serving trays and we had some much food they had to bring out a extra tray for our sides. Needless to say, cupid himself would have fallen in love with this meal. For the sides I had some cornbread and brisket chili and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was awesome as well as the brisket chili. The cornbread was good but they serve up the sides in little aluminum cupcake sized containers which are fine for most of the sides they have here but could be a little more generous when it comes to the cornbread. Anyways, they also give you plenty of extra BBQ sauce on the side for dipping and it is sweet, salty, spicy and everything you'd want for a BBQ sauce. The bread pudding was also some of the best I've ever had and it was another one of those cases when I was actually kinda sad when it was all gone. I still cherish it's memory, kinda like you would a childhood pet that was once a important and close part of your life but is now gone forever /sigh.... If you like ribs and great brisket you have to check this place out. I'm looking forward to going back as soon as I can to try out some of their other items.
