Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Very good deep dish, although not as good as my still-reigning-favorite, Pequod's. We got a large pie, half Classic (which comes with sausage) / half Lou (which has spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, and a three-cheese blend), both of which were good. I do think I may have liked the cheese or pepperoni more, but hard to say. Regardless, overall I thought this was very good, but not close to Pequod's.
