Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////My boyfriend and I stopped by around 9:15 on a Thursday morning. The hostess told us there would be a 25-30 minute wait but we were seated in about 10. Once we were seated, the waitress promptly asked us if we wanted anything to drink. We both got coffee, which turned out to be pretty average. After a few minutes, she returned and took our orders. I got two eggs sunny side up, hash browns, chicken sausage and the berry bliss pancakes. My boyfriend got the cinnamon roll pancakes.
