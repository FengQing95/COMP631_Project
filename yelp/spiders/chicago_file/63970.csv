Smoque BBQ////I ordered the Brisket Platter, and when I asked the cashier if she recommended it chopped or sliced, she told me "sliced is best if you want it juicier and chopped is best if you like more of the smoky, taste of the more cooked parts of the meat". She even offered for me to have 1/2 sliced and 1/2 chopped, so I of course chose the variety. The brisket was some of the most delicious I have ever had, and I would definitely recommend both. The two made in house BBQ sauces were fantastic as well (one was served with my friend's chicken and one was a special brisket sauce). I tried a bite of the chicken, and it was extremely flavorful and balanced with its perfect smokey taste.
