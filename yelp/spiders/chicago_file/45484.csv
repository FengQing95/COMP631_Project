Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Two of my favorite dishes were the octopus and potato, and the paella. Unfortunately, there was very little octopus and a whole helluva lot of potato. Kind of a rip off, as I would have like to see more octopus. The same dish at Iberico is much more satisfying than here, but I still enjoyed it. I also (surprisingly) loved the seafood paella. Now, I lived in Spain for a year and have had my share of authentic, unbeatable paellas, and of course Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba isn't quite there yet, but it was damn good. Nice and creamy with a good dose of seafood peppered throughout the dish, this is a must order.
