Little Goat Diner////Let me first start off by saying the portion sizes are unbelievable.  Considering the quality you're getting, the dishes are worth two meals and you will probably be taking home leftovers.  This restaurant is part of the "goat" group so you know the meal is gonna be good.  They offer the breakfast menu all day so no worries about missing out on a brunch.
