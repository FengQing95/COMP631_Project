Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////To avoid the crowds, and knowing deep dish can take at least 40 minutes to bake, we went early on a Saturday about 4:30pm.  The restaurant wasn't busy and while I was expecting kitschy decor, it was rather plain with some various sports jerseys. It was nice to be immediately seated and to start hydrating after an unexpectedly warm early May day.  We immediately selected our pizza and placed our order to get that baby baking! I definitely recommend selecting and ordering your pizza first before deciding what else you want.
