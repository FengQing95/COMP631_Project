Little Goat Diner////I was frankly underwhelmed by Little Goat. The beer list was pretty run of the mill, the burgers we got were fine but way too expensive for the quality, the space needs better sound absorption because it is *extremely* loud, and the service was so-so. There's a lot of hype about this place, but it seems like it lacks substance.
