Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My favorite dishes on the menu (I've tried basically everything!) are the patatas bravas (best I've ever had outside of Spain), shrimp in garlic, bacon wrapped dates, goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, spinach & manchego stuffed mushrooms.... I could go on and on. Â That's why it's best to go with a large group, so you don't feel weird ordering 12 dishes (though I've gone with one other person before and done it... you'll just have a lot of leftovers!).
