Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////But first, the restaurant: We took the brown line to merchandise mart and the restaurant was only a few blocks away. very convenient!! The place, as I've said, was packed! There were people outside, and as soon as we opened the door, it was hard to get in because people were waiting. Â the restaurant interior is warm, brightly lit with orangey lights, tables pretty close together but not in a bad way bc it gave off a very homey feel. The employees (the one who directed me to the restroom and the one that helped me at the counter) were all very nice, easy going, and friendly.
