Smoque BBQ////Too smoky of a flavor. I don't like my food tasting like I cooked it on a $12 grill at Bonnaroo, but that's truly the type of taste it reminds me of eating. Prefer fat Willys off western. Even like Dino a bit more and that's pretty mainstream. Still not sad I tried it. The line makes it seem like it's going to be super legit, but then it's just pretty good.
