Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The food was just... ahh there are no words. We got the appetizer platter which was perfect since I always have a hard time deciding what I want. Also, it's always nice to have a variety. We got 2 small deep dish - the Malnati Chicago Classic and the Lou. Like I said, I have a hard time deciding when there's too much options! Can't remember which one I liked better, they were both delicious! I like Lou's better than Giordano because the crust was not hard and definitely easier to eat.
