Little Goat Diner////Met a girlfriend for a casual week day dinner. Love the diner atmosphere and decor is adorable. The menu is fascinating and it was hard to digest but our waiter had some great suggestions and helped us make our choices quickly. The food was delicious and I can't wait to come back to try something else. I had the "This little piggy went to China" and my friend had the Korean burger. Both portion sizes were good- she did take half her burger home. The joint was jumping for a Tuesday evening but it wasn't overly crowded or noisy by any means. I'll definitely be back to try one of the fourteen other items on the menu that sounded good
