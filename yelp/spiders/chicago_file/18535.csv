Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////5 star for what it is, a casual pizza place that makes the classic example of Chicago deep dish pizza. Some may prefer more artisan or complicated versions. But I think the simplicity is the virtue. Simple bright tomato sauce , mozzarella, thin sliced pepperoni. $9 lunch special is a bargain for downtown with personal deep dish pizza, good size dinner salad, and refillable Coke.
