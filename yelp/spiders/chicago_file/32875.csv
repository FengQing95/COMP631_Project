Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Started off our vacation with dinner at Bavette's, and it was a great choice.  We had the bacon roasted tomato salad as an appetizer and it was delicious, highly recommended.  I had never had thick cut bacon before, and it was really good.  Not sure why all bacon isn't made that way.  I went with the 10oz filet as my entree.  Asked for medium, but it was closer to medium rare. When ordering a $55 filet, I think the less you cook it the better.  I barely used any of the bearnaise that came with it, it was so good by itself.  This ended up being a very pricey meal, but overall it was definitely worth it!
