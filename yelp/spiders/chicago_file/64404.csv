Smoque BBQ////The brisket here ROCKS MY WORLD! It is seriously OMG good. This is my third time having it and paired it with the Carolina Sauce. It was even better this time than the last. So tender... it fell apart and melts in your mouth. Sooooooooo, amazing! The homestyle fries make me happy, too cause I'm gluten free. Good GF fries and BBQ are hard to find.
