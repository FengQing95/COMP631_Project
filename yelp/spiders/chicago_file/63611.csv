Smoque BBQ////That being said, there is tons to like about Smoque. Every single side dish is amazing - possibly the greatest BBQ sides in Chicago outside of Lillie's Q. Succulent mac 'n cheese, brisket chili is original and delicious, great beans, and a hell of a cornbread. The meat is the star of the show; especially the ribs. Great brisket (both chopped and sliced), amazing links, and an even better rib selection (baby back & St. Louis). Haven't tried pulled pork. Both sauces (Carolina & Memphis) are delightful. Price is decent - what you would expect. BYOB makes it amazing. Location is central for all of Chicago and easy to get to and find parking.
