Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The restaurant itself was fairly busy which is great for a Monday night, so my friend and I sat down at the bar. I tried the Passion Fruit Sangria which was pretty awesome. The bartender told me their specialty was the Mango Sangria, but I'm not one for Mango..so if you are you should get on that. Next drink wise I had a mean margarita. It was delish.
