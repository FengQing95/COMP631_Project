Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Speaking of Gilt, I did try to order a chocolate cream pie (to go) at the end of the evening. After we placed the order, d-bag waiter returned to say that we just missed the last one but if we go to Gilt just down the street we can get one there because that's where the pies are made. Thanks jerk off. By the way, he says this after making an unsolicited comment that he liked the card that hubby got me better than the one that I got hubby. Gee, didn't remember asking but thanks anyway now bug off. Oh and what you're saying is that if we had been seated on time, I would be heading home with my hubby (and his superior card) on our anniversary to go relax on our couch with a movie, more wine and a piece of chocolate cream pie ... but instead if I want the pie I have to go down the street. I'll pass. Thanks.
