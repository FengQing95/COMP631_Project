Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Be prepared to wait! I don't think it matters what day you go, there will be a wait. A touristy spot? Well, yea but so what! You go to the hostess put your name in and you order while you wait. It doesn't really matter that you put your order in way in advance because when you get seated, you'll still have to wait.
