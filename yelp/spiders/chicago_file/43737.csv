Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went on a date here on a Saturday night and the place of course was hopping. we had a reservation & waited about 20 mins for a table, i think we were a little late. many groups of single women in their 20's very dressed up on what seemed to be a "girls night out". our server was very nice and was always checking on us. my water glass never stayed empty. my date had a few glasses of red wine, different one each time & enjoyed them. we were pleased with everything we ordered minus a shrimp dish. wish i could remember what it was called, but it was waaaaaaaaay to salty. the smoked salmon with cumcumber spread is delicious. it seemed from the menu everything was priced reasonably, but i didnt pay the final bill so i cant comment on that.
