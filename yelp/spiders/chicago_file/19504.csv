Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I don't like pizza but Chicago style has made me a craver for these deep dish accomplishments. I have been to two pizza places when in Chicago this place and Giordani's both excellent, what makes this place stick out is the sauce, heavy, flavorful, buttery crust I would say more but now im salvating haha
