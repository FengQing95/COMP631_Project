Little Goat Diner////Bull's Eye French Toast -- a combination of Texas french toast, chicken and waffle.  The unique taste left me confused especially from the bbq maple syrup.  I did appreciate the touch of yellow berries.  I appreciated the left over better when my palate appreciated and acclimated to flavor combination.
