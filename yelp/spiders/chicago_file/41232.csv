Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////yea...this place is pretty cool...ive been here twice..once in the summer and sat in the outside terrace and once in the winter and sat in the inside on a sunday...both times were pretty awesome...go with a group of people that love tryin new things and hit up as many different dishes as you can...the chefs are pretty solid here..i mean they should be since its a lettuce...but its a good time...
