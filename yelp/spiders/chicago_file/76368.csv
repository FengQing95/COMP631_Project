Little Goat Diner////Goat Chili Cheese Fries were thinner fries with a pretty good crisp to them covered in a red bean, tomato, goat chili and some sort of cheesy sauce. They were good but next time I'm ordering something else to explore the menu as they weren't earth-shattering. Chili had a fairly goat forward taste and the cheese was milder than anticipated.
