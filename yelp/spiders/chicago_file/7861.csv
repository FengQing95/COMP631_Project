Art Institute of Chicago////Amazing. Breathtaking collection of Asian art and artifacts, Japanese Silk Screens, Modern and Contemporary Art. We even had the treat of viewing works such as Nighthawks, American Gothic, The Picture of Dorian Grey by Albright, some classic Whistlers as well as a few superb paintings by Georgia O'Keefe.
