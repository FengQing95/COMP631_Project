Little Goat Diner////The overall service was pretty mediocre.  We ordered the Hot Crab Dip, which was ok but didn't have nearly enough crackers.  It was hard to get someones attention to get someones attention, so much so that someone in my dad had to get up and find someone.  Water glasses and drink glasses were left unfilled.
