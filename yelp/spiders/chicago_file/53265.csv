Smoque BBQ////Overall a pretty good place, might not go out of my way to get back there but after a sox game sure. Good price for lots of good food, about 12 dollars for all of that plus a drink. Slightly disappoint how the BBQ sauce had more flavor than basically everything, or at least the meat. Â Not much of a line at all when I went. Very organized I was very impressed.
