Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The Malnati Chicago Classic personal sized pizza ($8.95) comes with tomatoes, sausage, and plenty of cheese.  For $0.90, you can get extra toppings; pineapple worked well for this Hawaiian diner.  Unlike some of my fellow Yelpers I had a reasonably soft crust - likely because the Classic comes with a special buttery crust.
