Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Anyway, skip the seafood towers. It's not worth $150+ for what you get. It's fresh and pretty good but...nah. Crab cakes were really good. I'm pretty sure the goat cheese was responsible for not feeling so hot the next morning. The petite filet I had was actually outstanding. Cooked just the way I love it and it was extremely flavorful. I didn't use much of it and I don't know what that sauce was on the side - hollandaise? But it was so good. Loved the "Goldbrick Sundae" and the chocolate pie.
