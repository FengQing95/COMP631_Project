Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza was good but I still give a slight edge to Gino's East.  The original deep dish was filled with hamburger sized portions of sausage on each slice which was a little overwhelming.  The Lou was definitely an interesting combo of veggies and cheese but there was too much going on to taste the actual pizza.  Veggies and clumps of cheese were sliding off everywhere!  I did enjoy crust of these pies which were crisp and less buttery than Gino's.  The place was small and there was no wait unlike some of the larger chains but I still felt cramped by the amount of people in the dining area.  The size of this place reminds you of a local neighborhood gem but for me there is just a little something missing that I got at some other spots.
