Little Goat Diner////The cutest restaurant ever.  The spinning little goat on top of the restaurant is perfect. You walk in and the energy hits you. We sat at the bar for a quick lunch that was amazing.  The menu is huge and has anything you'd want.  I want to go back for these sourdough pancakes.  Oh and our server, Ezra... Amazing.  Go Ezra!  I will definitely be back :)
