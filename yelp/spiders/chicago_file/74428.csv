Little Goat Diner////Dinner would probably get 3.5 stars on its own. The service, if I remember correctly, was pretty helpful in steering us away from boring chicken fingers (don't even know why I was considering them) and towards the goat chili cheese fries. I'm picky about my chili cheese fries (and am an Edzo's loyalist) but these were fantastic. Lots of depth of flavor. The manicotti, on the other hand, was meh. I ordered it because of the interesting rhubarb sauce twist, but the rhubarb made the sauce too ketchupy.
