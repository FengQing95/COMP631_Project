Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Amazing. I wish I could give more than just 5 stars. I know Chicago has tons of great restaurants but if you are in the area you need to give this one a go. Obviously make reservations, don't think you will get in without one. When we walked in we were greeted right away and whisked off to our table. I note that because how many times have you had reservations and still had to wait? I hate that. Anyway, once sat our server Kipp came over right away with complementary drinks! Wow! Let me tell you why, they had to change our reservation time from 9 to 7:30 (which wasn't a problem) but apprently someone let Kipp know and he thanked us for being flexible. I mean I could just stop writing there and I would have left 5 stars!
