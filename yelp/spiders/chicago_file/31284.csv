Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I had my hopes set high for Chicago Deep dish and would have done better at Pizza Hut. No seasoning on ANYTHING. Had to drench my slice in Ranch/Parm/Red peppers to be able to even finish a slice. Wow. Major let down. Only reason this got 2 starts and not 1 was we tried the wings as an app which were amazing. And also the service was amazing as well.
