Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Best deep dish in the city in my opinion. Anytime out of towners visit us wanting deep dish we take them here. Malnati's Chicago classic is the best, but don't be scared off by the veggie Lou. The freshness of their tomatoes in their sauce and how good the sausage is in the Chicago classic is unreal.
