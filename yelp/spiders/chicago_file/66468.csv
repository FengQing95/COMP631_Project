Little Goat Diner////Sooo...a friend and I went here on Friday night. It's a tad confusing because the diner is connected to a Little Goat Bread (I think) which also has a bar at night and coffee and sandwiches during the day, as well as a separate menu. I still don't totally get it. But anyway, we walked into the bar and there were no seats available at the bar. So, we were told to see the hostess in the diner about getting a table. I asked if it was the same menu and she said yes, I think. But it turned out that the bar area next door (Little Goat Bread) has a day menu consisting of sandwiches that is unavailable at the diner (according to our waiter). Regardless, we were able to get drinks at our table in the diner. We also tried the crab dip with Ritz crackers. That was a little disappointing because even though it tasted like crab, it contained no visible crab pieces. For me, it was too creamy and smooth and there was too much of it to finish, even for two. The entrees were pretty interesting and ranged from some pretty standard sounding breakfast fare (served all day!) and other entrees. The mac and cheese looked good but we didn't get that side. We both ordered the whitefish tostadas, which were really excellent. You get three of them, with very big pieces of firm, grilled (or maybe baked) fish, atop crispy tostadas which I am sure are not good for you, but were really tasty. The seasoning was perfect with harissa adding a kiss of heat. We didn't try dessert but it looked like they have some fun choices, including milkshakes, with a heavy emphasis on chocolate. The service is laid back, not super attentive, but fine. The crowd in the diner is pretty diverse, with a number of kids early on. The bar is nice and dark and was even more crowded later.
