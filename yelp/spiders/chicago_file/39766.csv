Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For appetizers, we ordered the steak tartare ($18.50), which one of the workers claimed to be his favorite item on the menu, and the roasted bone marrow ($18.00), which came with 4 sizable pieces and some bread. The steak tartare was really good, and came with a pretty generous amount of meat. It definitely seemed fresh. The bone marrow did not disappoint, either. It was delicious.
