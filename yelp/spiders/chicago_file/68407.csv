Little Goat Diner////... We've since been back for breakfast and that was really good too. Got the bulls eye french toast, which is delicious if you don't mind a pretty serious sweet/savory mix. Also got the Parathas Burrito which was very unique and really good too. All in all it seems you can't really go wrong here. And at 8:30 on a Saturday there were plenty of tables available.
