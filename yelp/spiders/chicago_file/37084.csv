Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's Bar & Boeuf is now one of my favorite steakhouses in Chicago. It doesn't have that stuffy, corporate feel that most steakhouses have. The staff here is very friendly and does a great job recommending dishes. Overall we had a great time and I would highly recommend Bavette's to out-of-towners, or locals looking for a steak that's not overrun with salesmen on expense accounts.
