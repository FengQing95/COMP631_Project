Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////- didn't meet my expectation (and it could be my fault for imagining how good it is before I get to try others and compare their pizza). From all the pictures on yelp, pizza looks super gooey, cheesy, and warm. However, mine was not gooey (cheese were just solid) and not warm. I'm not sure, but when I looked at others...theirs don't look that gooey either. So is it not supposed to be gooey or today was too busy due to Chicago marathon?
