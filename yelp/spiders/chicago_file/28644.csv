Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It was our first time trying Chicago deep dish pizza. The staff was very friendly and efficient. I like how you can go ahead and put in your order while waiting to be seated. We ordered the classic deep dish pizza (sausage and pepperoni) and it was super filling. It was delicious. My only complaint was our drink we ordered was made incorrectly, ginger ale instead of ginger beer. Other than that, it was a yummy meal!
