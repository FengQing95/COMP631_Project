Smoque BBQ////I don't care about how the seating is and the crowds, I'm used to it at about any popular place in Chicago. My gripe was that for all the hype, I expected some kick butt ribs. I orderd a chopped brisket sandwich with mac n cheese. The brisket was OKAY. I didn't really care of the stale type of bread, and I didn't like the taste of the sandwich sauce. Although decent, my palete craved a different taste.
