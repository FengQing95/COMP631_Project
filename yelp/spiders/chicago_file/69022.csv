Little Goat Diner////they eventually called our name and we scrambled into our long booth and ordered... the whole menu. got the corned beef hash, the breakfast spaghetti, the french toast, the grits, and lots lots more! everything was YUM! coffee was simply meh, wish i had continued to free load off my friend and her free refills. at the end of the meal, nothing remained and we clambered into cabs, no longer little goats.
