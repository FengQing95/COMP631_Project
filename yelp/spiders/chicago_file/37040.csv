Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I leave thinking this is a really good steak joint, and that maybe I was acting a bit uncharacteristically like a prima donna.  It's now very late.  I get back on the El with renewed vigour and confidence, inoculated by really well-seared steak.  The three crazies yelling at me to part with part of my life savings to them to fight the various ills of our society on the train on the way back to my hotel are now no match for my sunny optimism.  The protein induced high has now overridden my better judgment.  I tell them to get bent and that I will not be funding their addictions tonight.    The panhandlers realize they are no match for me in this deliriously steak-fuelled state.  They back away muttering obscenities under their breath, cursing their bad luck in running into such a well fed and satisfied customer.  I am ready to take on all comers, all thanks to Bavette's Bar and Beouf.
