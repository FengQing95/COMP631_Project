Art Institute of Chicago////Overall though, I would absolutely visit this museum again, there is a lot that I missed, and there were a few items that I wanted to see that were out on loan, or having conservation work done. Just be prepared for a very long day. The museum is only open from 1030 am to 5 pm daily, so you could easily spend an entire day there. Definitely get there before they open to queue up.
