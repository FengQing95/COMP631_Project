Little Goat Diner////With some of the wait JP treated us to a pretzel ice cream sundae amazingness. Having the mix of caramel,  crunchy pretzels was a perfect flavor/texture combo. I couldn't get enough and I'm glad I saved room for dessert.  Check out my picture! It was sooo good I would come by just to have it!
