Little Goat Diner////I would love to come back and try other things on the menu because everything We tried was great but I feel like lunch shouldn't take 2 hours from beeing seated to paying our bill. Its seems that I've talked to other people who have had the same things happen... even walking out after sitting at their table for 30 minutes without even getting a menu.
