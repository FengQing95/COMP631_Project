Smoque BBQ////This place is awesome. I love BBQ but try not to eat it too often. so when i do, i want it to be great and this place hits the mark. We ordered for a big group so i got to taste almost everything. The brisket, pulled pork, chicken are all good. My favorite was the brisket. The ribs are great too although they have too much sauce for me. i like the dry rub rib style.
