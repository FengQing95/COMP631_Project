Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Let me start by saying this is the best crab cake and fillet mignon I've ever had. The crab cake was seared on the outside, and creamy inside. The flavors were rich and just a little tartar sauce topped the whole thing off. A must order! I loved the bread and butter served with the meal as well; the bread had a hard crust and was warm and soft in the middle.
