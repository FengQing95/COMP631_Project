Little Goat Diner////I had the chickpea salad with fried chicken I added. Fried chicken was delicious but not necessary. The salad has chickpeas as well as a softer falafel like ball as well. Delicious dressing and sauce Â on the side if not enough. I added a biscuit($3) which looked big enough for two. Also had the sparkling rose($12) so good!
