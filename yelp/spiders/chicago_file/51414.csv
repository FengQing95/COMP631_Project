Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I really do love this place, I've been so many times. It is a cute spot, tons of seating with smaller, more intimate rooms. Great sangria, so many flavor options. Bacon wrapped dates, the goat cheese and tomato sauce, curried chicken salad and the ham and cheese croquettess are my favs. That chicken salad is seriously awesome. Plus with Lettuce Entertain you, you always know you will have a great experience. My family also hosted my baby shower here! It was so nice. We had our own private room with exposed brick walls and tons of space. The service was excellent! Always find myself coming back again and again:)
