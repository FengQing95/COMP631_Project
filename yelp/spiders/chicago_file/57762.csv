Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The tapas are also a steal for $1-$2.50 per plate. I'm vegetarian and loved all of their vegetarian options. The garlic potato salad was AMAZING and I usually never like potato salad. The crispy potatoes were delicious and the spicy sauce that came with them was the best! The chickpea stew was also super flavorful and great for the winter.
