Little Goat Diner////The honest to goodness star of the meal was the "This little piggy went to China". It starts with a sesame cheddar biscuit, szechuan pork sausage topped with chili garlic, chive sauce and blackberries topped with a sunny egg. It was sweet, spicy, filling, sweet, spicy, delicious! It was all we talked about after we ate there, and now looking at the pictures I am having some withdrawls. This restuarnt is so good!
