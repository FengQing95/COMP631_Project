Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have to say the deep dish pizza (Malanatis sausage special) was very tasty but definitely hearty. I also got the Lou's special thin crust pizza with spinach mushroom and spinach and it was delicious. Both pizza was butter crust which was very tasty, that's coming a lot from a girl that hates crust... on anything.
