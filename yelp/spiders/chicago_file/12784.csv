Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'd give 3.5 stars if I could.  I was told this is the place to go for the real deal deep dish pizza.  We had the Lou Malnati Salad and the Lou's Pizza with the spinach mix.  WE loved the salad.  We also loved the pizza when it first hit the table and for the first slice or so, but then it kind of loses its luster as you plow through it.  It fills you up fast and if you don't stop as you soon as you feel it, you will get over-stuffed!  To me it's a good novelty meal for once or twice a year.  Kind of greasy crust with a huge amount of mixed cheeses. Go there really hungry and keep water next to your bed that night!
