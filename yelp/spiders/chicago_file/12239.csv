Art Institute of Chicago////GREAT art museum in Chicago-- a must go for any local or tourist. The collections are endless! I have been many times, but I always see something new every time. The museum guides are helpful for getting you to the "must see" works of art. The outdoor garden is an especially lovely place to sit and enjoy when the weather is nice!
