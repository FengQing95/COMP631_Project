Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////One of our first stops within our first hours in Chicago. Pizza was everything I dreamt of. Buttery crust. Filling. Toppings were superb. Lou's Special was what we got. Their 3 dip appetizer though was very underrated. Also loved the trophy room feel with all of the jerseys hanging on the walls.
