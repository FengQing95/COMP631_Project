The Purple Pig////Roasted Cauliflower with sliced pickles was delicious and refreshing. I am NOT a Cauliflower lover at all but I was convinced to try it and I found a new appreciation for it and enjoyed it. This Cauliflower preparation was different than any other I had before, thin sliced with small thinly sliced pickles all roasted together. Very enjoyable my hats off to the Chef!!
