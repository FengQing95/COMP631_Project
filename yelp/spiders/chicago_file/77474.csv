Little Goat Diner////My favorites include the okonomiyaki, pork belly pancake sandwich, and tonkatsu. Obviously all have an Asian flavor and are incredibly delicious. My girlfriend has gotten a couple of the burgers and they're certainly unique combinations - unique in a good way, she's really liked them.
