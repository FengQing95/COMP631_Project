Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They don't take reservations or do call-ahead seating, btw.  We arrived around 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.  There was about a 20-minute wait, but they do let you place your pizza-order when you sign in (given, apparently, the long cook-time required).  So we hung out in their small waiting area for 15 minutes or so and got seated.  There are seating areas on both the ground and upper floor.  Both floors were full.  The noise-level was high, if that bothers you; it was okay for us.
