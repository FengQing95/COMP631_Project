Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////On one of my last trips here, our service was just about perfect. The sky had opened and it was pouring BUCKETS!! Â Lou's glowed like a homing beacon and we headed in. There were two of us eating and we were seated immediately. Hot coffee, cold drink, and we were on our way. Being Chicagoans, we really don't eat deep dish often, but we splurged and ordered the namesake. Right on time, our pizza sailed to our table and we ATE. To top off all of the glorious cheese, our waiter came by and provided a free dessert that someone had changed their mind on. We found room for that sweetness too!
