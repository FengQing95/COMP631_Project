Art Institute of Chicago////I love coming here!  All the art displayed is so incredible.  I used to come here a lot when I was little for school field trips and I thought it was, well, boring.  Now that I can actually appreciate the art, I wish I could come here more often.  You can spend so much time here looking at all the beautiful artwork, and it's insane how all those pieces were created sooo long ago.  It's really amazing!
