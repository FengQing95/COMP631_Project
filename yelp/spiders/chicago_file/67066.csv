Little Goat Diner////We are there and the first thing we noticed was the loud noise. Not only was the music turned way up but just the natural crowd noise was substantial. I downloaded a decimal app on my iPhone when the music subsided and recorded 85 to 90 decibels, right at the upper limit recommended by OSHA for a workplace. The waitress was impossible to hear and forget about carrying on a conversation. We ordered burgers, a patty melt for me and the American for my wife. Both were mediocre. My patty melt tasted like it had Big Mac sauce on it. Then there was the sticker shock. 3.25 for a glass of Diet Coke. 70 bucks for two burgers (12 bucks apiece), two Diet Cokes, two glasses of wine and a side of Brussels sprouts. The acoustics problem stems from so many flat or glass surfaces. With the high prices, they should spend some of that dough on sound proofing. Until they do, we won't be back.
