Art Institute of Chicago////What a fantastic museum.  It's located in Millennium Park.  It's Open daily 10:30-5:00, Thursdays until 8:00.  Buy your tickets online before going in order to avoid the lines.  They offer discounts for Chicago residents.  For those visiting from out of town, it's $25 for general admission or $35 for the fast pass (Fast Pass allows visitors to bypass the general admission lines at entrances and offers access to the museum's galleries and nonticketed exhibitions).  Fast pass was worth it alone to avoid the line getting into the museum.
