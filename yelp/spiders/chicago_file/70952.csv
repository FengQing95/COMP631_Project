Little Goat Diner////The problem with this restaurant is the problem with Chicago dining in general... There is not a single healthy option or way to modify food to become healthier at all. Even the salads are sitting in bowls of cream sauce. I understand that it's a diner and that it's not supposed to be a salad bar, or vegetarian restaurant, but you'd think someone as creative as Izard would have some reasonably healthy options on the menu.
