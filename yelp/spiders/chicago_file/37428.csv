Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Had Mike as our server. I wasn't feeling well and we decided to take our food to go. He had it expedited and it was ready in 15 minutes. He was so friendly and informative about the menu. The ambiance was so cool. The food was delicious even with a plastic fork and knife in our hotel room. That plastic knife cut right through that steak. I wish we could have experienced the real deal but it was handled so professionally. I highly recommend you eat there...plastic knife or metal knife.
