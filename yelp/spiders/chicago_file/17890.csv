Lou Malnati's Pizzeria//// My sister, her boyfriend, and a coworker put in an order for pickup (we didn't want to wait for a couple hours on a Friday night) and ended up getting a large " The Lou". What is this? A freakin deep dish of spinach, tomatoes, and mushrooms with a blend of cheeses, all on top of a garlic buttercrust. We're all huge fans of garlic so this pizza was just freaking off the charts with the garlic. MMMMMmmmMm.
