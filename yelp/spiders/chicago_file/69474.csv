Little Goat Diner////On my second visit, I tried an omelette and was bowled over. I am a person who loves breakfast foods for any meal, so this is a great restaurant option for me. But they do have sammiches, hot entrees and a wide range of typical lunch, dinner items (each with a Girl & the Goat flair).
