Little Goat Diner////We were in Chicago and got sick of deep dish pizza after 1 dinner and am so glad we found this place! We had the pork belly pancake, goat chili, homemade bread, and the chickpea kale salad. It was all so delicious! The chickpea kale salad was huge and shareable. Highly recommend!
