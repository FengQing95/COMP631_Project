Art Institute of Chicago////Here's how: Back in 1852, businessman Potter Palmer opened up a dry goods store on State Street in Chicago. This eventually led to a Dry-Goods-Empire and Palmer becoming exceedingly rich. He built a hotel, he built a mansion, he established a university, and he married a well-educated woman 49 years his junior named Bertha Honere. Needless to say she didn't marry him for his virility.
