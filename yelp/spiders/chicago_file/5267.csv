The Purple Pig////The Purple Pig has been a longtime favorite spot of mine and after many years it continues to impress. In fact, my latest visit was my best yet. I went here for lunch with a group of four and we split a bottle of ros√©, and one order of the salt-roasted beets, whipped feta, chicken thigh kebabs, and octopus. It was the perfect amount for four people, and we were all silent when the food it the table because we were so busy eating. Though we thoroughly enjoyed each dish, the table favorite was the Chicken Thigh Kebabs - the combo of the crispy smashed potatoes, and deliciously creamy Tzatziki sauce was to die for.
