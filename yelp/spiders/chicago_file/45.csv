Au Cheval////went here once earlier this year, and only because i forgot that blackbird stops serving lunch at 2. probably won't be back unless dragged. service and ambiance were fine, but the food was not. the burger just tasted like salt and grease. our server recommended that we add bacon and a fried egg. apparently people enjoy it that way. but those are the people who enjoy this burger to begin with, presumably because they've been told it's so good so many times by so many people. i can't think of any other reason. i would say this is a harmless cult and at least nobody's actually drinking the koolaid, but then i think of the thousands and thousands of bloated bellies and clogged arteries. ugh. so greasy. the bacon itself was the best thing in the bun, but it was so thick that it was impossible to take a bite without destroying the burger's integrity and making a sloppy mess. the egg was a mistake, considering that the burger would have been too greasy and rich even without it. i eat pretty much everything, and i'm all for decadent foods, but this one was just...unpleasant. no redeeming flavor. Â we also ate the matzo ball soup. the broth was insanely salty. like salt-lick salty. despite that, the giant matzo ball itself was somehow totally flavorless although texturally i did enjoy it. the duck heart hash was boring and--surprise!--excessively greasy. the cocktails were mediocre versions of classics that other bars make better. it also sucked paying more than we would have at blackbird for a really half assed meal. at least it was a weird time of day and we didn't have to wait two hours to be totally disappointed.
