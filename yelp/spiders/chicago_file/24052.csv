Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Well worth the trip ... all the way from Utah.  The first time I had a Lou Malnati's pie was a couple years ago when a Chicagoan co-worker had a few shipped to Utah and shared them as Christmas gifts.  The frozen version was pretty darn tasty, but when I got to Chicago today that memory led me straight to Lou's for the real deal ... and the real deal did not disappoint!  The pies take about 40 minutes to cook, so if you are in a hurry, this probably is not the place. But 40 minutes is the perfect amount of time to enjoy an order of Lou's traditional buffalo wings, a cold drink and some sports on the bar TV.  I ordered the classic Chicago deep dish pepperoni pizza, though made a mistake and went with the "personal" ("feeds one") variety.  Being a hearty eater, I certainly could have slammed down a small, "feeds two" pie, but that doesn't mean I was disappointed in the food--only my apparent lack of ordering skills.  My pizza was terrific!  Seriously, I am going to insist that my work meeting crew order some Lou Malnati's pies for lunch tomorrow, and you can rest assured that I will be devouring more than a personal pie then.  Bring it on!!!
