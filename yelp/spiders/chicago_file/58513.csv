Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We had chorizo wrapped dates (how could we not), morcilla sausage, stuffed mushrooms, wagyu carpaccio, and the grilled octopus. All was so delicious, but the standouts were the carpaccio, of course, and the mushrooms. The wagyu was so smooth and buttery and paired really well with the cheese that came with, and the mushrooms were so flavorful and cooked to perfection.
