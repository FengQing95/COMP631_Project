Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////It did not disappoint!! We ordered the croquetas, buratta, garlic potato salad and paella con pollo y verduras. I have absolutely no complaints. It was all so good! The croquetas came with a blend of ham and chicken. They were crispy and delicious! I especially loved the garlic potato salad. It was a simple dish that was packed with garlicky flavor! (tip: you might not want to order this if you're on a first date).
