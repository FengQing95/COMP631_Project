Art Institute of Chicago////In a matter of 3 hours (or more), I went back and forth in a time machine through works of art. I couldn't believe I was looking up close at a sculpture from the 13th century. This was more fascinating than looking at T-Rex and his whole family's fossils. Every painting before 1900s, I stretched my head out as far as I could, with my eyes lingering on the paint to see how centuries of years of paint didn't melt. I'm surprised the alarms never went off on me for going so close. You'd be surprised at how much photos I took of this place, security kept an eye on me.
