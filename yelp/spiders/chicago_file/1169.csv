Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Stumbled into this place while entertaining a friend from out of town. Was surprised to see lots of people waiting outside though several reviews said this was a quiet and less hectic place. Ordered the special omelet with figs as I'm a fig fiend, it was definitely unusual, the sweet figs an unexpected twist. For $1 extra, you get to substitute the buttermilk pancakes that came with the entree with any specialty pancakes, what a great deal! I got the one with berries, it was nice & fluffy but a tad too sweet. All in all, huge portions for the price and tasty food, and love the fact it's right next to Millennium Park. I know a stellar review will only make the weekend wait worse, but they deserve it! keep up the good work!
