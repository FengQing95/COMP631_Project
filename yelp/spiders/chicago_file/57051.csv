Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This restaurant is has a very unassuming outward appearance but inside the place is huge, always packed and quite loud.  The parking across the street is free; the parking in front of the restaurant is usually available but is metered.  The food is great - especially the paella.  Order the seafood paella immediately when the waiter comes to the table - it takes 40 minutes for them to prepare it, so you want them cooking it while you decide on everything else.  We had four people and a 2-serving paella plus 7 tapas was too much for us.  6 tapas probably would've worked.
