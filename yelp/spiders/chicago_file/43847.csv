Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been here several times and willingly admit at one time Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba was the best. Recently they have really fallen off the delicious wagon. It is a sad story. This last time I went (which inspired me to write this cautionary tale) the spicy potatoes and flank steak...YUM. The grilled squid, ham croquettes, goat cheese in spicy tomato sauce, paella, and the rest of the meal...SUB PAR at best. Stale bread, over cooked calamari, the rest flavorless and uninspiring.
