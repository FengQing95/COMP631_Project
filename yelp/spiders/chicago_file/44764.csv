Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////After all of the hype about this place I was really let down. The tortilla espanola was way overcooked to the point of being dry and everything else was super greasy. Â Service was extremely fast - a good thing because we ate in the smoky bar and I was happy to get out into the fresh air.
