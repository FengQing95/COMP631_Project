Little Goat Diner////We checked in at around 7:30p.m on a Friday night and was told it would be an hour wait and we ventured over to the bread side to grab a drink. My friend and I got the haymarket which was really good. Coming from someone who doesn't normally like beer so not sure if the beer fans will like it but I loved it.
