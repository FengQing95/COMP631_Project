Little Goat Diner////Went for breakfast there was about an hr wait which wasn't too bad for Labor Day Monday. I really enjoyed there coffee as well as there cinnamon roll but Ann Sather's beats it. I also ordered there Spanish omelette which was delicious really loved the combination of the flavors and liked that the masa chips it had didn't get soggy, but I ordered a side of there hash browns and ruined the flavor of the meal It had a really strong taste of a really bad cheese, there menu didn't really say what kind of cheese but when I asked the waitress she said it was goat cheese but I've never tasted such bad flavor my taste buds couldn't recover to finish my meal. If I ever do go back I will definitely get the Spanish omelette again but I probably will not its hard to hold a conversation it was extremely hard to hear the people I was with everybody in the room seem to be shouting I ususally don't mind loud places since I speak pretty loud myself but it was extremely loud.
