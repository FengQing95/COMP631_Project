Smoque BBQ////The portion sizes for the meat are large but the sides seemed a bit skimpy to me. The foil ramekins that the mac and cheese came in were small but I guess that's so the star is the meat, The peach cobbler for dessert- also good but call me crazy but I'm a girl that likes my food served on dishes. I get the simple approach- I just don't like to eat off of foil, paper lined trays and Styrofoam bowls.
