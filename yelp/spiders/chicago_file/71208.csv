Little Goat Diner////I chose the Dark Chocolate Chip Crunch Pancakes served with chocolate malt butter.  Holy goat.  I was celebrating National Pancake Day a day late and have had chocolate chip pancakes before but these quickly topped all previous expectations.  The bitterness of the dark chocolate chips was a nice compliment to the sweetness of the pancake batter. The crunch contrasted heavenly with the softness of the pancakes.  So delicious and filling that I had to take half of the order home as leftovers.
