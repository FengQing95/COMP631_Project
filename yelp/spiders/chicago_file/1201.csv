Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Not sure what the fuss is about and why anyone would wait to eat here. This was my 2nd visit and I was not impressed either time. Â Pumpkin French toast was terrible-very dry. Venetian skillet and brisket hash both had WAY too many onions and yet not much flavor. Friendly staff, though. I'll stick with Yolk in the future.
