The Purple Pig////- The bone marrow, brussel sprouts, and pig ears, and pork shoulder were all nothing special. Tastes just like any other restaurant that serves these dishes and I think I was expecting more of an elevated experience. Instead, I felt the brussel sprouts were too limey and the pork shoulder was too bland. Same with the pig ears.. like crispy onions with less flavor. The ingredients they paired with bone marrow was nothing out of the ordinary... just salt and some arugula.
