Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I dig the tapas bar experience and was pretty darn excited to try Ba-Ba-Reeba.  (Not to mention, I really enjoy saying the name out loud!)  When me and my main squeeze got there, dinnertime on a Tuesday, we were seated immediately on their super-cute patio area, which is adorable namely due to the hanging lanterns strung across it.
