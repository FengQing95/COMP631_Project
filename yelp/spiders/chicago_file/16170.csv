Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came in for lunch during the weekday. I had their deep dish pizza in personal size. The pizza was ok nothing special. Perhaps it was the small size that i got... I felt like i ate more crust than anything.... But I'd be willing to come back and try their larger sizes to see if there'd be more cheese, sauce, and flavor to them
