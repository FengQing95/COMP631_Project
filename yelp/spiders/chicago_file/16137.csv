Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We made it in time for the lunch specials, which included a pizza, salad and drink.  We were able to get different ones so we could swap ingredients.  The salad, with their homemade dressing was very fresh.  Their ice machine was out that day so unfortunately someone like me who loves ice in their drinks, it was very sparingly given.
