Little Goat Diner////I'd been wanted to try out Little Goat for a while because I know it's a popular spot. The whole place is themed like a diner although the food is more upscale. We split brussel sprouts and 2 different sandwiches. Overall it was pretty good. The sandwiches were flavorful and brussel sprouts were amazing. It's a little overpriced for upscale diner food, but definitely worth checking out once.
