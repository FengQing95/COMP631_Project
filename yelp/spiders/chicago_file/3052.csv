The Purple Pig////Wow we sure got lucky! Came here on a bustling Friday evening and we were seated immediately at the communal table. The waitress attending to us was immensely observant and helpful; she gave us suggestions on how to pair the wine with the food we ordered, and even came back to take additional orders after she saw us glancing down at the menu again.
