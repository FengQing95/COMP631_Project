Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Meat heaven!  Bavette's and Maude's are a tie for me (both better than Gilt), but they each have their own feel and menu specialties.  Like, Maude's the menu at B3 is perfect for Chicago winters and the ambiance is correspondingly cozy while still maintaining an old-school classy vibe.  Bavette's is better for steak, has large portions, a little bigger menu, and the space is larger.
