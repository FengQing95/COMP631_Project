The Purple Pig////Couldn't decided between a couple items on the menu, so the bartender described the dishes to a T. Had the Braised Pork Shoulder to start, loved it. Tender and the mashed potatoes are creamy and smooth. Then finished with the Salted Beats with Whipped Goat Cheese and pistachio butter. It's sweet and could almost pass as a dessert. Highly recommend!
