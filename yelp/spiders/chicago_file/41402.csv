Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great tapas though, definitely enjoyed the pork, that I forgot the name of but it had a cherry sauce and it was delicious! Sangria was okay, a bit diluted to my taste but a fair warning, their potato dishes are quite large. We ordered only one but our server thought we wanted another potato dish we inquired about so we ended up with two potato tapas for 3 people.. way too much potatoes. Definitely want to put in a reservation before coming here though.
