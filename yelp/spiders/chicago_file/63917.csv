Smoque BBQ////It may surprise some people that Chicago doesn't actually have a strong BBQ tradition and there aren't a ton of places where you can get really good BBQ in town. As a BBQ lover, some people brought this place to my attention. As I recall, this has been on some Food Network show (probably DDD) and the line can be quite long here in the summer.
