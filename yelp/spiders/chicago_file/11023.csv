Art Institute of Chicago////What a special place.  No visit to Chicago is complete without touring this amazing museum. My 3rd time here, each visit outstanding.  Every square inch is covered with art; from three dimensional,  to paintings, photographs-everything.  We are blessed to have this museum as part of our nation's fabric. Honestly, the best $29 ever spent each of the 3 times paid!
