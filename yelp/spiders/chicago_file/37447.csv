Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////After another glass of champagne, our food arrives and wow! Everything was delicious. This was hands down one of the best steaks I have ever had in my life. The pork chop was HUGE (see photo) and so tender and juicy. The sides were incredible. I was blown away. I mean this was a 5-star dining experience. I can't rave about this place enough.
