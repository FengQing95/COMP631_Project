Smoque BBQ////Our mini crawl was coming to a stop with our bellies being pretty full by the time we arrived here. We were able to park just down the street (for free, no less), and were happy to see no line on this sunny summer Saturday at about 4 pm. We walked in and right up to the counter, only one person ahead of us, and lots of seating. Yay!
