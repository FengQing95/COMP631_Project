Smoque BBQ////We go here a few times a year. It's pretty good food (we live on the South side so I have to really be craving it to face the drive), albeit parking can be a PITA. Consistently good food, service is always on point & the the desserts are delicious. My only quibble is that they don't always have the best pick up times for take out & they don't have a branch closer to Hyde Park.
