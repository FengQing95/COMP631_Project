Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I have lived in Chicago my whole life and by far this is my favorite restaurant. It is BYOB and instead of a wine corkage fee they take a glass of wine and give it to another table of your choice. They have absolutely the best steak I have ever had in my life. A gift card to this restaurant is my every birthday and Christmas gift! Also try the chocolate cake!!!
