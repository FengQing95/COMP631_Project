Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Sadly, my favourite dish was the lamb with mint sauce and ratatouille. Greek & French, but absolutely delicious. The shrimp skewers and mushroom bruschetta were also quite good. Toasted bread w/tomato caviar, cheese, and jamon were as expected. My husband loved the fried banana dessert & the kids loved the chocolate mousse. Sangria is still great.
