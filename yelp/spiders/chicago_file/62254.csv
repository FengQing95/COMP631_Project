Smoque BBQ////I've been coming here for a year now and tried everything I could off the menu and I've come to the conclusion that the best thing on the menu is their smoked chicken. Get the chicken. I repeat GET THE CHICKEN. I've been to a lot of barbecue spots and nobody does smoked chicken like Smoque. Nobody.
