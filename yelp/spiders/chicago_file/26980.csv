Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Went here with a large group of 25 + plus which was probably our first mistake. We got seated about 2 hours later. Was quoted much sooner and they took our orders so they could start making the food. We sat down and waited a very long time. Pizza finally came and it wasn't warm. It was pretty good because I like cold pizza however I was bummed I didn't get to taste this pizza as it probably normally would be good. Several people recommended so I'm sure it's normally delicious but just not a good place for large groups
