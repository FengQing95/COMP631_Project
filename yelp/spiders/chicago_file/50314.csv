Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Whenever I'm visiting my hometown, Chicago, I have a specific craving... Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba. It may be because I LOVE appetizers and duh, a tapas restaurant is perfect for "endless-appetizers-for-dinner" BUT this place has good food! It may be one of the most popular items, but the goat cheese in tomato sauce I could eat all day long. My last visit my friend and I tried the lamb kebab... it was a very small serving but delicious nonetheless. Bacon-wrapped dates, the complimentary bread & oil, pumpkin soup, calamari, patatas bravas, I could go on... And I must to mention the desserts! They are perfect-sized RICH desserts. I've tried them all and I love them all equally.
