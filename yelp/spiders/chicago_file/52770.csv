Smoque BBQ////Smoque, without a doubt is the best barbecue in the city. Â  I've never had anything there that wasn't absolutely awesome. I recommend the pulled pork, hot links, and Mac and Cheese--my favorite ever. The prices are right, staff is friendly, and the swine is delightful. Keep it up, Smoque!
