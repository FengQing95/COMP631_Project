Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bone In Ribeye -This was great, but we all agreed that there was not a lot of meat around the actual bone. In fact, it was really fatty there and not the good melt in your mouth type of fat either. Because of that, if I got this again, I'd do the Chicago Cut Ribeye instead which is boneless.
