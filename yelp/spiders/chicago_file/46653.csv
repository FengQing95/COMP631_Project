Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Long before my husband and I were engaged we had many conversations over where we would host our wedding reception.  We had decided that neither of us wanted a 200+ people wedding in a gigantic ballroom or banquet hall.  We wanted something much smaller with great food but with nothing in particular in mind.  Then one day while we were enjoying dinner at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba we saw a bride walk out of the private event in one the rooms.  Immediately a light bulb went off and we turned to each other.  It was so obvious.  Why not share with our wedding guest our favorite restaurant?
