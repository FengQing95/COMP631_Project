Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////- Pot Roast Benny (~$9): Fantastic!!! It was a real hearty version of an eggs benedict. The pot roast was tender and shredded. A very generous amount of meat I might add. Perfectly poached eggs with a yolk that broke beautifully. Chipotle hollandaise sauce which I liked and didn't like. I liked the sauce in the very beginning but after awhile I kind of just wanted regular hollandaise. But it was still very delicious all together.
