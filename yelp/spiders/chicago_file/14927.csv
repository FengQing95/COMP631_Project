Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We actually tried to go to Monk's, because someone had suggested it as a cool sports bar to watch a Red Sox game (I was with a coworker who's obsessed, I could go either way on Boston).  But Monk's, which I should review poorly, didn't have their cable working.  So we took a stroll across an amazing bridge and beautiful skyline, and just happened to hit Lou's.  We were just walking briskly by and saw a big TV screen, smelled some pizza and immediately RAN in.  We sat at the bar, ordered my FIRST EVER deep-dish pizza and a Miller Lite and plunged IMMEDIATELY into heaven.
