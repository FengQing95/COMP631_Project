Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was shocked at how plain and terrible the pizza was at Lou Malnat's. I have had Chicago style pizza other places before so I was really expecting something amazing at one of the most famous places in Chicago. The cheese was extra rubbery, the sausage was dry, the only good thing was the bread and the sauce. The line was also out the door expect about a 1 hour wait at a minimum. The prices are however reasonable but the cost of the pizza can't be much. I would say try another "authentic" spot this place does not deliver yelpers.
