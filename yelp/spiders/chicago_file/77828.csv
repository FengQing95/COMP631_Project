Little Goat Diner////Bulls eye French toast - I hate to be the only one to dog on this, but I did not enjoy this as much as I thought I would. The French toast was soaked in the BBQ maple syrup so it was soggy and the only soggy thing I like is French fries from McDonald's. The chicken was fried nicely and the egg in the brioche was cooked perfectly.
