Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When in Chicago you have this try this place, went here based as suggested by locals and 4000+ reviews on yelp. Though very few options for Vegetarians but had to try the Chicago style deep dish pizza. We ordered "The Lou" and all deep dish pizzas take more than 35 mins to arrive so make sure to order some salad or beer to kill some time. The 45 minute wait was totally worth it. 4 stars not for food but only because it takes a long time to arrive.
