Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I love Bavette's! Â The atmosphere is super swanky, drinks are delicious, and the food is always cooked to perfection. My favorite is the seafood tower, filet with the seasoning on the side and French fries! I can't think of the other items, but everything is always scrumptious!
