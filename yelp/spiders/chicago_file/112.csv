Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I went to breakfast with my daughter at this restaurant this morning for my birthday.  It had very good food and a good server.  Otherwise the experience was 100% awful.  We will not return.  We were seated at a table almost inside the kitchen.  Then a team of waiters persisted in setting up a table inches from us for a large party throughout our entire meal.  They were rude, loud, scraping chairs and moving them quite close to us for not five minutes but for 20 minutes.  Then when the party was seated the woman next to us was so close that her hair flipped into our food.  We were constantly asked if we were done with our food as if we were being rushed out.  There were other free tables that would have been a better choice to seat us at but we had no idea to ask for this because the entire table moving process did not start until after our food was served.  In addition, there is no waiting area for tables.  The front desk staff was very rude and we had to wait for our table outside in the cold.  There were 3 people at the check in desk when only 1-2 are needed and it would be better if the third person was staffed to manage table placement better.  We will not return to this.  $30 for breakfast in a nice atmosphere for their food would be worth it.  $30 for nonsense, disruption and a rude staff (except for our waitress, who was wonderful) is ludicrous.  Don't waste your time.  There are many other breakfast spots in the loop that are better with more polite and well managed staff.
