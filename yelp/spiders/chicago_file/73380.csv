Little Goat Diner////I had the fried pickle "sandwich".  It was served open-faced; the bread was naan and it was topped with hummus, tzatziki,  goat cheese, roasted peppers, kale and fried pickles of course.  WTF!?!?  Whoever came up with this sandwich was either drunk or pregnant...but hopefully not at the same time.  I simply had to try it because there was a whole lotta whack going on and I wanted a bite.  If I'm eating out I like to try something new and something I'll never be able to make myself at home.  It was all kinds of whhhat in my mouth; crunchy fried pickles contrasting creamy sauces, tangy vinegar flavors and smooth savory sauces.  My taste buds were all cray cray trying to figure out what was coming down the flavor palette next.  It was chaos.  It wasn't bad but it was crave worthy goOOod.  It would be better as an appetizer to share so everyone get confused trying it.
