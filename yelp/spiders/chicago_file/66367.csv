Little Goat Diner////I want so badly to give the Little Goat a five star review. Just can't. If I were basing this on food only, five stars. If I were basing this on service, negative five. If I were basing this on whole experience, two to three stars. Let's talk about the experience. When we visited, it was 96 degrees outside. Oh, guess what?  THE AIR CONDITIONING WAS BROKEN at The Little Goat.  Brutal. This was definitely a fluke. It was Africa hot in there. Stuck to seat. Thick humid air. Sweat dripping off of everyone. Again, review cannot be based on this fluke; they were addressing while we were there. They felt so awful about it, the manager provided us a gift card for our troubles. Very nice. So why bring this up if willing to overlook?  This, on top of the horrible service, made for a long lunch. I almost want to believe that the server was struggling with the AC being down. Our server, was awful. Dirty plates on our table stacked in the middle, empty water glasses, empty cocktail glasses. No silverware. Missing, all the time, she was. The worst. So are all confused why four stars? The food is AMAZING. Overlook what I would call a fluke and try the gourmet comfort food. The menu is diverse and fresh. The ingredients are of high quality and the portions are plentiful.  We loved our food options. I had the chicken cordon blue. Delicious, and to die for.  We started with the nachos. They were full of flavor. The food alone is definitely five stars. I hope the work out thee other stuff for more positive experiences.
