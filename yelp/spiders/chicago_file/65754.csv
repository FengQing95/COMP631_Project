Smoque BBQ////I've been told about this place & how it is one of the best BBQ in the city. Therefore, this place had some high expectations from me.. & it they were met and exceeded! Located a block down and right past the interstate on Pulaski and Irving Park, Smoque is in its own tiny hot spot. I came here for dinner on a weekday night RIGHT BEFORE the line grew outside the doors.
