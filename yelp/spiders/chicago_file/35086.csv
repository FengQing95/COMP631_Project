Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our waiter doesn't bother to stop at our table until 9:15 PM, so we have had a 15 minute wait. Not good considering this guy literally circled our table about four times before stopping at our table. Maybe he got dizzy from circling so much, I don't know. Anyway, he takes our drink orders, which do not come until 9:30. I had the Sazerac, which was a little strong; it was clear that the bartender had a slight overpour. However, the drink wasn't bad because of the slight overpour. The drink was bad because the bartender gave me so little of it in the glass. Not good.
