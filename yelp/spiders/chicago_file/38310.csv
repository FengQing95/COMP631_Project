Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Being from Texas, I am skeptical of an out of state steakhouse really being able to compete with what I am fortunate enough to have locally. Not to say steakhouses in other places are not worthy, or not good, but I have found that it is hard for out of state bests to compete with local bests.
