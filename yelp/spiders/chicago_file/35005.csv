Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband and I came here for our 3 year anniversary and we were so glad we did! When we walked in, we felt like we were on the set of Game of Thrones. It has a very medieval feel to it. The steak was  probably the best I've ever eaten. I got the petite filet and it was so tender and flavorful. It came with a rich bernaise sauce. The bacon app and corn side were as good as all the reviews say they are. The sweet potato brûlée was the perfect accompaniment to all of the savory food. I Highly recommend this place! We can't wait to go back!
