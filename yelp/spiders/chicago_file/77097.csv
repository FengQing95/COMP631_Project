Little Goat Diner////One of the most interesting brunch menus I've ever seen. Amazing food and very creative dishes. We had the this little piggy went to China, los drowned, goat chili, apple spiced pancakes, and tempura mashed potatoes. Everything was excellent but our favorite was the goat chili. I'd definitely go back here next time I'm in Chicago.
