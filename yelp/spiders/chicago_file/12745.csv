Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My husband flew in to join me on the weekend...and I wanted him to try deep dish pizza, so I took him to Lou Malnati's.  He ordered a deep dish sausage pizza and I ordered a thin crust...because I was OVER deep dish.  I happened to try his deep dish...and OMG...I changed my mind.  It was delicious.  Go to Lou's and you won't regret it.
