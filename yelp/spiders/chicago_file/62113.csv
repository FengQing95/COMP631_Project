Smoque BBQ////Great little BBQ place in a cool neighborhood not far from downtown Chicago. Their ribs have a nice bark, and I love their half pulled pork / half brisket samdwich and their brisket chili. Great place to eat and walk off dinner and look at the great local architecture when the weather is nice.
