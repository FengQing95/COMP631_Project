Art Institute of Chicago////Moving beyond the impressionist exhibits, check out the American art galleries for an expansive group of art spanning 1770s to the present. Make sure to check out American Gothic, and Hopper's Nighthawks. There are a lot of works by O'Keeffe as well, and a sprinkling of other artists.
