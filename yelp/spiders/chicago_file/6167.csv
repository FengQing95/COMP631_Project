The Purple Pig////This was a really great find. I have celiac (a serious gluten allergy) and asked if they could clean the cast-iron pan / equipment prior to serving us. They took great care of us! We ordered turkey leg, salmon & cauliflower "small" plates and all 3 were AMAZING. My favorite was the salmon, my friends fave was the turkey leg. They even brought non-gf lentils on the side for her. Â I did not get sick :) Very accommodating, great service, atmosphere on point and amazing food!
