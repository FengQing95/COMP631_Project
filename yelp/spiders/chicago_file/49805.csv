Smoque BBQ////Went to Smoque again, and keep waiting for it to suck since it's so popular. It does not suck. My hubby got the full slab, 1/2 St. Louis, 1/2 baby back. I always get the pulled pork. Just really good. Simple, nice and smoky. Good balance on the ribs of not TOO falling off the bone, but a nice chew. I like the fries. Some reviewers have called 'em mushy, I really enjoy them, and there's a hint of black pepper on them. Really yum.
