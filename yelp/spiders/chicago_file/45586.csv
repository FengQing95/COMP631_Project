Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is a great place to eat vegetarian without feeling at all deprived.  The selection of hot and cold vegetable tapas is fantastic.  I recommend the patatas bravas, the mushroom empanadas, and the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce.  Our waitress was very sweet and came by to check on us periodically without being obtrusive, and at the end of the meal she surprised us with complementary slices of a delicious tres leches cake because it was our first time at the restaurant.  The host was also very accommodating and welcomed us warmly despite the fact that we showed up 5 minutes before they stopped taking orders. Excellent food, excellent service, great dining experience overall.
