Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Very cool atmosphere. FABULOUS whiskey cocktails--especially the "old fashioned"...BUT...the food, with the exception of a few standouts (the Rib Eye, the Seafood Tower) is very average and expensive. The service is really hit or miss also. Definitely worth trying, but not worth the wait.
