Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I prefer Giordano's over this place. It takes 35-40 minutes to make the pizza, which is fine if you end up getting an incredible pizza. The pizza was just ok. We ordered a large half the Lou Manat√≠ special and half the classic. The sauce was good, but the crust was not the best, kind of hard and chewy at the same time. The cheese was terrible. It stretched but was like rubber. I had hope this would be a good deep dish but I will have to keep looking!
