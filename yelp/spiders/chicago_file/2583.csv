The Purple Pig////We've had this meatball type dish before with brioche. I don't see it online, or maybe I overlooked it. This was very mediocre. The menu stated the dish came with brioche. So my boyfriend and I were thinking at least one slice, right? Wrong. It was the tiniest disk in the world. What a rip off and huge disappointment that was. 2/5
