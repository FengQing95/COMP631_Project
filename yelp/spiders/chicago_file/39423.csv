Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I ordered the beef short rib with pasta with a side of    Brussel sprouts , they were OK - my husband ordered the bone in ribeye with a side of mashed potatoes he finished his entire plate. Safe to say he enjoyed that. The sides are definitely big enough to share the amount of food that we bought thinking it would be enough for two people could have easily fed for so keep that in mind when ordering. I took a few bites. Then ended up taking it home.
