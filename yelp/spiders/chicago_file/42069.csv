Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We are here visiting friends and they wanted to try out the tapas, so we came for happy hour in the bar. We loved the bacon wrapped dates, chicken empanadas super yummy. We then had a butterscotch custard for dessert. We highly recommend coming here, waitstaff was very friendly.
