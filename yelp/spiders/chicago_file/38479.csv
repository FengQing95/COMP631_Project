Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I didn't find the food to be that great - everything was good, but nothing that you cannot taste in other lower priced restaurants. Now, I didn't try the steaks so I can't say how great they are compared to other places. I think the waiter mentioned that steaks is what they're known for.
