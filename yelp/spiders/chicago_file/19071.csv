Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Service was decent.  The pizza was amazing.  I love this crust.  The crust could get by on it's own.  Thank god it doesn't have to. So much cheese.  A mountain of cheese.  and sausage.  Whoever thought of putting a huge patty on the pizza pie was a genius.  And the sauce is just about perfect.
