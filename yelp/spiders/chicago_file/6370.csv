The Purple Pig////I had really high expectations for this place. We tried the sardines, the cauliflower soup and the skewers. Every dish was well executed but not particularly special. For example I found that the chicken skewers had a lot of fat and the tzatziki sauce was very sour (actually, it was not really close to the traditional tzatziki).
