Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I give this place a good rating because it was easy for us to get a table, but that was probably because it was the only place opened during the winter advisory for the extreme cold winter conditions. While everybody else decided to stay closed, it didn't keep the vigilant few from enjoying their night.
