Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////-The beef was the real showstopper. I have had a lot of steak in my life. The filet at Bavette's was the absolute best I've ever had. The meat was so tender, I have no idea how they achieve that. And the outer part of the filet had the most amazing texture to accompany the tender interior meat. It was honestly a life changing experience...get the beef!
