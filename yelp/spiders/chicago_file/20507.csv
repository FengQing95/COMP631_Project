Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Best pizzeria if your looking for something quick to eat. Amazing prices for such a good quantity of good quality of food. Food comes out really quick, within 10 minutes; and the deep dish pizza coming around at a later time. Service is cool, everyone is really peaceful and nice to you if you ask any questions about their food. Overall, I would 100% recommend this restaurant for a quick and easy place to eat or to hang out with your friends and crack a cold one with the boys ;)
