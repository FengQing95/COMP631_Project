Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Reviewing just the food, we ordered the trio of dips and pizza chips (app) and a medium half old, half new deep dish (Malnati's and Lou's). The trio dip was actually really good- pizza chips were coated in a tomato, buttery spread and the roasted garlic dip was delicious! The artichoke dip was way too buttery (?) or oily for me.
