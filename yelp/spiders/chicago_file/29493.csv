Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////To keep it simple - I did not care for the deep dish pizza or the calamari. This was my first time trying deep dish pizza, so it's very very possibly that I just don't like deep dish pizza and the restaurant prepared everything accurately. Given their yelp score and the amount of reviews - I'm assuming they make great pizza - my friend and I just didn't care for it!
