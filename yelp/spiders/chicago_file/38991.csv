Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The service was quick, attentive, warm, friendly, and un-pretentious. Getting a "good steak" in DC means snotty servers that ignore younger guests for fussy older folks. Not here obviously. Just 100% pure, comforting, meat bliss. The place is so dark and comfortable I felt like I was in a meat opium den.
