Art Institute of Chicago////The museum has a selection of pieces that you should hit if you are limited on time. I would definitely go a weekday since these pieces will be surrounded by people taking selfies. Get close and personal with Seurats Sunday Afternoon, Chagall's windows, Caillebotte's Paris Street and walk through the Ando's screens. There was a lovely exhibit in the contemporary wing that allowed you to take your shoes off and walk on sand. I'm not a huge fan of contemporary art but I love experiencing the pieces close like this.
