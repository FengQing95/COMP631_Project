Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Nothing bad here but nothing memorable here either. Started off with a date wrapped in chorizo stuffed with cheese: good; and the olive stuffed with anchovies: I don't like olives but my cousin does she said it was good. Ordered a fresh farm salad (their signature) lacked seasoning but very fresh and light. Then ordered the short rib with mashed potatoes: it was ok, a bit chewy and also needed more seasoning. Octopus was probably the better dish of the night but I've had better elsewhere. Scallops were fine but again not that memorable. As for the dessert.. Skip the caramelized banana, the waiter highly recommended it but nothing more than just caramelized bananas. The truffle chocolate cake had nothing to do with truffle and was super dense and chocolatey, not my style.
