Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I think the food is good and the portions are a nice size for a tapas restaurant.  The bar service is always nice (again, I've never actually sat down and eaten in the restaurant) and you still get a server if you're at a table for the happy hour tapas.  I've always had a pleasant experience at Ba-Ba-Reeba and I'd go back again.
