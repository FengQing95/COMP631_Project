Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been wanting to come here for a long time and we finally made it out on Wednesday for happy hour at the bar. They had $3 tapas so we got to try a ton of different things. My favorite was the bacon wrapped dates. It was a combination of sweet and savory but really bold flavored! We also had the ham croquet, chicken empanada, meatballs, and the mushroom toast thingy. They were all small flavorful bites. My bf also had the grilled octopus but was disappointed that it was a bit too salty. We also order the pork paella. It came out really hot and well seasoned. Â Overall, ton of food!
