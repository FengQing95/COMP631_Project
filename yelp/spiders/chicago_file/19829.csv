Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Everyone around me savored every bite of their pizza and made those "oh... ah... this is soooooo good" noises and paired it with eyes rolling to the back of their head. I double checked 3x to make sure I was eating out of the same pizza box as everyone else. I was. Maybe it's a Californian thing. Or maybe Lou Malnati's has been hyped up too much. Or maybe I don't know..... I'm not meant to enjoy Chicago pizza. I will emphasize that everyone I shared the pizza with, including head chefs at popular River North restaurants loved the pizza. Maybe you'd be better off following their reactions, not mine.
