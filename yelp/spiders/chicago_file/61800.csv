Smoque BBQ////I was put off by the Soup Nazi atmosphere.  As you walk up, you're greeted by a large sign indicating "the rules".  No alcohol.  No self seating. No x y z.  And then the staff boss you around regarding where to stand and close the door and etc.  By the time we got through the hour long line to order, I was thinking these had better be the world's best ribs to justify this behavior.  The verdict:  probably not delicious enough to go back and be bossed around again.
