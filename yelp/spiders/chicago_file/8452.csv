Art Institute of Chicago////The Nichols Bridgeway is not yet open, but still stunning to look at from the street.  It stretches nearly an eighth of a mile and I was told its shape was inspired by the shape of a sleek, racing scull.  It rises up to 30 feet above street level.  Once the public is allowed to access the bridge it will be open from 7:30am until dusk.
