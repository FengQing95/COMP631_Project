Little Goat Diner////Little Goat is one of my favorite places to take guests for a weekend brunch meal. Although a reservation is almost always a must and we tend to wait a few minutes despite the reservation booking, the food is worth it. There is an enormous variety on the menu. One of my favorites is the cauliflower bibimbap bowl. Definitely make a trip to Little Goat!
