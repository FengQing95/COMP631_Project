Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Love Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! I have been here for a few times and recently came in for a friend's birthday dinner. It was the perfect place for a group to get together! We had a table of 8, so we ordered 2 of almost everything, which was perfect. Also started off with pitchers of the mango sangria which were delicious. I have also been here for brunch and had a great experience. One of my favorites in Chicago!
