Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I like the lunch options and the quick lunch choices. Times for wait are pretty much accurate, though give 5 minutes on a busy day, such as the first day of spring/summer, or when a concert or sporting event nearby is happening. The seating is comfortable enough, and their menu offers plenty of options.
