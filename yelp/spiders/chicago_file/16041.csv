Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ah, the debate about Chicago style versus thin crust.....well I grew up in Chicago and so I have room in my heart for both kinds.  As a kid, my parents would order from Lou Malnattis occasionally and it was always a big deal.  Now as an adult, I order from time to time, as well.  But ya gotta be in the mood for this kinda za.  If you like Chicago style, then you should really like Lou Malnattis.  I have tried to stray off track and order something else off of their menu besides pizza.  I would have to say, dont bother.
