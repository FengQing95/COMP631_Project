Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////FOOD / DRINK: We started with half a dozen oysters, and then had the pork chop and petite filet for our entrees. The filet and pork chop were both incredibly tender and perfectly cooked and seasoned. Each came with mushrooms (included with the pork chop, add on for the filet) that were also excellent! We got the chocolate creme pie to go (we were in a rush) and that was fantastic. Super rich and decadent, and a huge portion! For drinks, we had the gimlet and champagne smash, and both were delicious. They also give you sourdough bread to start with, and the slices are huge, but it is VERY sour!
