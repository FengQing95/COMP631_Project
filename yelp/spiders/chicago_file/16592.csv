Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have to admit that we usually go to a different well-known pizza restaurant while visiting Chicago. After seeing Lou Malnati's featured on a Food Network show, we decided to give it a try. It totally lived up to my expectations. We got the Malnati's Classic pizza and added pepperoni. The crust was done perfectly and the cheese and fillings were absolutely delicious. We even got two frozen pizzas to take back to Michigan. I'm no connoisseur, but in my opinion this is the best deep dish pizza in Chicago.
