Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Now for the good part! We got The Malnati Chicago Classic and it was pizza heaven. Tons of delicious gooey cheese and the crust isn't too hard and full of flavor as well. As an appetizer we got the Malnati Salad to share and it's pretty big! That might have been one of the best salads of my life though. Couple that with a local Chicago IPA and this meal turned out really good. Don't miss out on this authentic Chicago pizza!
