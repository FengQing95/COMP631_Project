Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've had many steaks in my lifetime including Chicago Cut, Gibson's, Morton's, Smith & Wollensky's, etc. and Bavette's was the best I have ever had besides my own grilling of course. The steak was cooked to perfection as it was juicy, tender, and well seasoned with a little bark/crust on top. You know a steak is good when it doesn't need any additional toppings, sauce, or seasoning and this was the case at Bavette's. I did try the bearnaise sauce and salt seasoning and both were amazing too. The Mac n Cheese with bacon is one of the best Mac n Cheese's I've had in the city. It was hot, creamy, not overly rich, cheesy, and sweet due to the bacon. It was heavenly! I didn't realize that Bavette's was owned by Hogsalt, which is the same owners as Au Cheval until now and they use the same bacon that they put on their burgers. If you don't know, Au Cheval was rated as the best burger in the nation a few years ago.
