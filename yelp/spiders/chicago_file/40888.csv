Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////After a long day of shopping on Michigan Avenue, my friend and I headed here for a fun evening of tapas for dinner. We started off with a cold tapas dish of the roasted eggplant with goat cheese. Next we had the jalapeno shrimp. This dish was really good! The shrimps were butterflied with cheese in the middle and then deep fried in a jalapeno cornmeal batter. Once you took a bite, the cheese just oozes onto your mouth. Next we had this pork kebab. The meat itself was good, but the presentation was amazing. The actually kebab was hanging on this "lantern" like fixture. It was SO cool... To go along with the meat, we ordered the spicy potatoes with tomato aioli. This was my favorite dish! Once I took a bite, I couldn't stop. They tasted like curly fries!!! SO good...I loved the how it was so spicy! Â I could have ate the potatoes all by itself!!! Dessert was the fun part! These were also served tapas style. We had the coconut bread pudding and the bananas flambe. Both were equally delicious... I loved how they were all tiny, so you don't feel guilty ordering a bunch!!
