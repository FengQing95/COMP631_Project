The Purple Pig////Visited the purple pig with a friend during a visit to Chicago and loved it! It's conveniently located near the hospitals in Streeterville. The atmosphere is casual. They have outdoor seating that is covered and not on the main street, so it's nice and quiet. The inside had seating and a bar area and was busy on a weeknight!
