Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Butcher block skillet is my favorite dish here - perfect for meat lovers! The portion is so big that I generally finish half and take the other half for a second meal. $11 for two meals is not bad! You can also add $2 to get specialty pancakes on the side. I generally prefer savory over sweet, so getting a small portion of pancakes is a perfect complement.
