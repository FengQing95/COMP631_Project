Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The cocktails are in true speakeasy fashion, well thought out and executed.  They are meant to be sipped and enjoyed for their complexity while taking in the lively scene of the grandiose bar and all the beautiful people at it.  I had the Lillet Rose while my husband had the Cognac Sezaric.  Both were divine.
