Art Institute of Chicago////Wow, I can't say enough about this museum.  We came early just before it opened and came through the modern bldg. entrance.  Already, there was a line out the door just before 10AM.  The museum has an unusual layout which we realized after the fact.  The wings and bldgs. are connected on the 1st floor but upper and lower floors are not totally connected.  So, you end up going back to 1st floor to get to other wings.  The impressionism collection was absolutely amazing and loved seeing all the paintings.  I thought we could finish in a couple of hours but ended up finishing the museum at 3PM.  Afterwards, we took the metro to Chinatown for early dinner.
