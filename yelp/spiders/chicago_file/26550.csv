Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place is INCREDIBLE. Visiting from NYC, my friend and I wanted to try traditional deep dish pizza and this absolutely exceeded or expectations! We made the silly mistake of not calling ahead of making a reservation, so make sure you do, and there was a long wait. Instead of waiting we sat at the bar.
