Little Goat Diner////This is undeniably one of my favorite restaurants in the city, especially when I'm looking for comfort food. The goat almighty burger is amazing and the corned beef kimchee rueben is one of my favs. The chili cheese fries are a meal in themselves and the pork belly pancakes (not actual pancakes) are awesome. I've been for brunch and dinner and have never been disappointed.
