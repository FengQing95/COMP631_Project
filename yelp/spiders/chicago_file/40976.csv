Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is probably my favorite restaurant out there! One of my friends found out about this place and made reservations for all 10 of us to go there for dinner last summer. The smell of the place was delicious... smelled like steak. Their white peach sangria were a hit!!! None of us had leftovers and food were in good proportions. We finished all their food so that shows how good they were! We even ordered more. Usually, we have leftovers but this time none of us did! I must warn everyone though that this place does get crowded and the wait was pretty long. If you want to take out-of-town guests to a classy and not too fancy restaurant, this is a place. They will enjoy it! The atmosphere is great, waiter is accommodating and nice, and place feels like I am in Brazil. Make reservations at least 2 weeks in advanced but I don't think you'd regret it.
