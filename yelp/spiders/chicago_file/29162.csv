Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Okay, now for the nitty gritty. Was planning on only getting the pizza but someone suggested the wings. Being the fatty I am I of course ordered it, wasn't sure if I should get the bbq or the buffalo style so the waiter suggested both sauces on the side and ranch. Hell yes. They arrived and they were mighty delicious. How the heck do I eat this and not be full, or pace it as slow as I can and wait for the pizza? I was hoping they weren't that good, but they were. So hard to do when you're hungry and have been saving your appetite all day for this meal.
