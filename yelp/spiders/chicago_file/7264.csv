Art Institute of Chicago////I understand rules and regulations but note to the rude staff at the art institute...take your "I'm better than you" attitude and stick it where the sun doesn't shine!!!  You may want to learn a lesson from this and inform your guests of your "new rules" prior to them getting their hopes up for their visit, only to be turned away because they have a freaking tic-tac in their pocket!   Funny how they still let me in their gift shop though.
