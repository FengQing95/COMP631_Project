Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here for a brunch in the private room. So we had a tasting menu and dedicated waiters. I arrived a little later than my party, but the waiter noticed right away, took my drink order and brought me a little plate of what I missed. I was so busy scarfing the food down I didn't get pictures of the first few courses! My favorite was the French toast -- AMAZING. The brioche bread was perfect, and it was a good mix of fluffy and crunchy. I'm also usually not a huge fan of eggs Benedict, but the one here was yummy and had the right balance of ingredients.
