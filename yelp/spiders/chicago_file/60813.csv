Smoque BBQ////Now, the food. I'll start with a disclaimer, as a native South Floridian, I didn't really know good BBQ from bad. I mean, we're known for not knowing how to vote, and not for our BBQ. But I married a Texan. (Yeah, girls, be jealous, they know how to grow them in Texas.) And, my Texan knows BBQ. So, an endorsement from him is a big deal. He LOVES this place.
