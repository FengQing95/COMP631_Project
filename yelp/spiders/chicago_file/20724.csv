Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou's has been and will always remain my favorite Chicago-style pizza. Delicious, buttery crust (whether deep or thin); fresh toppings (esp. Italian sausage); and a fair price. With locations around the city and delivery options galore, you can't beat it. Never settle for Giordano's or Gino's.
