Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I have a son with food allergies and today's experience was above stellar. Love it when restaurants go above and beyond to make it a safe experience. Wildberry made this amazing meal for my egg, wheat, peanut, tree nut, sesame and chickpea allergic child. Opened a new skillet and only had to take out the eggs from the recipe. Brought a yummy side of berry fruits and made it one of the best experiences. He said this was the best day ever...apparently topped going to Disney World (but he did say something about how Disney doesn't have skyscrapers and all the amazing structures. )
