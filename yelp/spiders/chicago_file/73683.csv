Little Goat Diner////This place is perfect for drinks (there is a bar), coffee (there is a coffee bar), bagels (best cream cheese flavors in the world!) and brunch (even if it's brunch for dinner). I love every single thing I've had here. But that being said, don't expect to find anything super nutritious - everything is mega-packed with calories, but very very delicious ones!
