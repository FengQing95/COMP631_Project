Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Chicago style deep dish pizza was good but not amazing. The crust was crunchy but hard to cut through since they suggest you eat it with a fork and knife. I like eating pizza with my hand and cheese to be melted or fully cooked but this one was not. The cheese was stretchy and doughy not done baking? The pepperoni was weak on flavor and not many toppings. I'm just really surprised or not use to this type of pizza. I ordered half Lou and half Malnati and they almost tasted identical. Everything was excess cheese which is too much for me but that's not bad. I was expecting the pizza to be thicker and deeper as I've seen on television and YouTube research. The pizza arriving to the table was another hour wait after my appetizer of wings came which is horrible wait time for a small order of pizza!! The waitress even said "your pizza will be out in 2 minutes", liar. I'm just being nice with 3 stars because I really liked the wings.
