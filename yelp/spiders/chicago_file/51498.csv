Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been here on several occasions, in different sized groups, and have never been disappointed.  The service is amazing, and each time the server has made helpful recommendations on dishes to try, amount of food that will be enough, etc.  My favorite dishes include the beef tips, garlic potato salad, paella, and of course, the bacon wrapped dates.  The desserts are adorable little nibbles, just enough to satisfy the sweet tooth after a savory meal.
