Art Institute of Chicago////The art here is exceptional.  I really liked how they had the art divided up as well.  Specific regions and time periods and nothing was too crammed together.  The spaces were big & open and allowed ample room to observe paintings, sculptures, furniture, & jewelry.  In addition they have a cool display of armor.  Armor from different areas around Europe.
