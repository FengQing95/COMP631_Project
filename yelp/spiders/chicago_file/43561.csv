Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I'm not a huge fan of tapas - the small portions and high prices - so I took a star off for that. Judging by the taste of the food, it's a 4, but price and size of serving still play a part in the meal and this is a place you can spend quite a bit and not be completely full when you leave. The atmosphere is very nice though and it's in a great location although it makes parking a little hard. After 6 there is just street parking at the meters that's a little hard to find and 2 hours max, and valet for $11.
