Little Goat Diner////My first experience was my favorite. I think the best way experience Little Goat for the first time is to have a few beers and then at 11pm decide Little Goat is what you need. My boyfriend and I did just that. There was zero wait time and we were in and out rather quickly. I ordered the Spanish Omelette and I mean, wow. I had dreams about that omelette for about a week following. It was so incredibly flavorful and delicious.
