Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This review is for customer service. I called Bavette's tonight (from DC) to see if I could order a bottle of wine for my daughter who was celebrating her birthday at the bar with some friends. Jay made it happen!  Thank you Jay!  You made my daughter very happy!  Great customer service!
