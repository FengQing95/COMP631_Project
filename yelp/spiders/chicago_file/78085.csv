Little Goat Diner////We stopped in here after not being able to get into another restaurant and I can't wait to go back!! We had to sit at the counter, which was fine. The waiter we had was great and very attentive with food allergies. The patty melt was one of the best we've had. We also had the Korean chicken tacos which were good, but I would get something different next time. And the fries were cooke perfectly! Can't wait to go back and try some other items!
