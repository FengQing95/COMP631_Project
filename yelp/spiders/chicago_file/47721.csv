Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Every single dish was fantastic - really EVERY DISH!! Some of the highlights were the stuffed mushrooms, hanger steak, beef skewer, buttermilk chicken thighs, and the bacon wrapped dates. For dessert, we had the butterscotch custard, chocolate truffle cake, and the seasonal sorbet (prickly pear). The desserts are perfectly sized - so you can order several! I almost forgot to mention the sangria - abundant choices of red, white and different fruit flavors. Our server Linsey M was great - very friendly and helpful with our menu questions. Love the intimate atmosphere of the restaurant. We look forward to returning and trying even more items from the extensive menu.
