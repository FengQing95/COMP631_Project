Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Amazing food, service and unforgettable experience! My fiancé made reservations for us to visit this venue for my birthday surprise and it absolutely lived up to the hype! When we arrived we were greeted in a courteous manner by the hostess who then immediately took us to a table in the middle of the restaurant that was a tad tighter and smaller than our preference so we asked if we could have a table where we could sit next to each other. They immediately obliged in a friendly way without hesitation and directed us where we could wait on the chairs in the waiting area while they prepared our table. While we waited the Maitre D greeted us and asked if he could  get us a drink. We each ordered "old fashions" and began talking about our bottle of wine as we brought our own bottle that we had saved for a special occasion. THEN the Maitre D invited us to sit in his section as his guests where he would take special care of us! Admittedly, this could have been planned as it was my birthday but regardless it made us feel extremely special and was an amazing start to our experience! Once we sat down we continued to visit with our host, finish our drinks, corked our bottle of wine to breathe and ordered Oysters and crab cakes. Both fresh and delicious. The host was very personable, interested, attentive and explained the menu in detail along with his preferences. THEN, the next thing we know, the host brings us two glasses of wine...complimentary of our friends at the table just across from us! WOW! We immediately introduced ourselves and began to converse with our new friends who brought over the bottle they had just shared with us. In turn, we shared glasses of our own bottle with them which kicked off a night of friendship and good will! We ordered our steaks to the chefs choice which were served cooked and seasoned to perfection and continued to have an amazing experience. At the end of our meal they brought out complimentary ice cream with a birthday sparkler which was an awesome way to top off an unforgettable night!
