Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Yeah this is simply the BEST steakhouse I've ever been to. Everything from the appetizers to the sides was out of this world. The highlight for me was the BACON. You have not lived until you have had this bacon my friend. From the very first bite I saw my entire bacon life flash before my eyes; memories of past bacon experiences going back decades that were simply nowhere near the experience Bavette's bacon provided me. Also shout out to my main man Joe for hooking it up for some first timers
