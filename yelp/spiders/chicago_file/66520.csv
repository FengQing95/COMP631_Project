Little Goat Diner////This is truly a "tale of two restaurants." On Saturday evening, we walked into Little Goat Diner and requested a table for 2. We were seated immediately. And we sat. And sat. And sat. After about 15 minutes, our waiter sauntered over and poured some lukewarm water in our glasses, never greeted us, never asked if we had drink orders. Then he went in the back of the restaurant and chatted up a co-worker for a while. Finally, we decided that even if he got with the program, this was not going to be a positive experience so we informed the hostess why we were leaving -- "Our server hasn't even spoken to us yet" -- and she just looked at me blankly, never responded, apologized -- nothing. Here is where the story takes an interesting twist. We walked across the street to Girl & the Goat, were seated immediately at a communal tablet and proceeded to have the fabulous dining experience that we have some to expect from Stephanie Izard's restaurants. Our server was fantastic and attentive and the food was incredible as always. Some of the standard of service from Girl & The Goat needs to seep across the street to Little Goat (cross-posting this on Girl & The Goat's Yelp and giving them 5 stars!
