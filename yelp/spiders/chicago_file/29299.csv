Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Went just before the restaurant opened at 11 am on a Sunday, managed to snag a seat outside. Felt some neglect because we were outside. Had to run inside to get the attention of a waitress for an order, maybe it was just too early to expect a full operating restaurant. Not too many big groups filled it during the course of our dine in.
