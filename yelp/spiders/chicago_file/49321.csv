Smoque BBQ////Go on a weekday around 2 and you won't have to wait long. The vibe is tremendous, the brisket is to die for, the duo BBQ sauces are yin and yang and the baked beans are magical. Even as a lifelong slaw hater, I discovered they make it with care and emphasize all the right flavors. This place is a Chicago goldmine for those feeling deprived of lip-smacking southern BBQ.
