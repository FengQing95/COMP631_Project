Little Goat Diner////The experience at this recreated diner was beyond disappointing. Â Elevated comfort food? More like uninspired, inhospitable, tired, unworthy. We had a reservation for an early time, lots of empty booths but we were seated at a tiny two top. (booths still empty when we left. Server came right away with initial service items, greeting etc. this was the last hint of attention we got. Took order, someone else brought food, resentful refill of drink, no check in to see if we liked the sad food. No comment as they cleared the half eaten plates. Unimpressed.
