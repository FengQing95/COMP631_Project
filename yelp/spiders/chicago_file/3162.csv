The Purple Pig////People are very into this place! First few attempts to eat here didn't fly, not waiting 2 hours sorry. This time I came with 1 friend at 3pm and we only waited briefly to sit at a shared table (space was tight but fine). Service from Corey was fabulous, great suggestions! The rockstar dish to me was the grilled broccoli, so much flavor. Got a great bottle of red wine from the Douro region of Portugal at a very reasonable price! The pork was great. Pass on the whipped feta. Overall very good food, but over hyped for sure so don't wait hours to eat here. Don't skip the broccoli if you get a table here!
