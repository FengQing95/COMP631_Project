The Purple Pig////Service was okay- dishes came out quickly, and front of house was very sweet. Our waiter was a bit mercurial, fluctuating between helpful kindness and mildly pretentious standoffishness, which threw us for a loop a few times when trying to order. However, our experience at The Purple Pig as a whole was greatly positive- pricing was very fair all things considered and the food was creative and thoughtful. I was slightly underwhelmed (expectations perhaps being inflated due to the many positive reviews), but I would love to return sometime to try their other dishes.
