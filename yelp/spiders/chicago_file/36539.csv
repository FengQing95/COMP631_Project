Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For such a fine establishment, I am appalled by the less than excellent service. For starters, as stated previously, there were many open tables around in the restaurant but they sat us less than 2 feet from a table of 4 gentlemen who were talking very..VERY loudly. We had a late reservation with not many guests coming in after us. On top of that, bread was not brought to our table until asked and when our bottle of water was empty, they would remove it but forgot to bring another one back. I wanted to give our waitress the benefit of the doubt -- perhaps they were understaffed -- but I would frequently see her just hanging out by the bar area.
