Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Fantastic service. Because the pizzas take 30-40min to cook once ordered we started with the Malnati salad which we highly recommend. The sweet vinaigrette tied this dish together so nicely. For our pizzas we had the Lou with olives and the Malnati Chicago classic. Both were absolutely mouth watering. My husband had the malnati and in hind site wished he had added veggies. We took home the large cookie which came with ice cream. We warned it up for a dessert later and it was also delish. Go here and if you love it as much as we did take home a frozen pizza for your next pizza craving.
