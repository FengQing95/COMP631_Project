Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The plan was to go for our dinner Sunday night, but alas due to the terrible sunburn/heat exhaustion I was suffering from, we decided to stay in for the rest of the day.  So we ordered delivery!  We got the Malnati Chicago Classic (sausage with buttercrust), and added in mushrooms and spinach.  The only problem with our plan was our lack of plates, and with deep dish pizza plates are pretty important.  We managed to make our way though, and enjoyed our bounty of cheesy deliciousness.
