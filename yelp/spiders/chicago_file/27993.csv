Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is my first time having deep dish pizza in Chicago. I heard about Loui Malnati's being the place to go, so it was worth a try. When we came, we were told the wait would be about 30 minutes for seating (it was really about 5 which was nice). Pizza takes at least 30 minutes to be made, so it may be a good idea to call in advance or bring something to do/be prepared to entertain yourselves for awhile. We tried a small 1/2 Lou 1/2 Classic Chicago (charge is for the more expensive of the 2), which is good portion size for two people.
