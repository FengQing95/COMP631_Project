Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Going at least 10 times a year, I recently went to their New Years Eve brunch. It pains me to broadcast this, for fear that it might put a damper on my own future reservation plans, but I recommend that everyone on planet earth goes to this brunch. In addition to their staple menu items, they also offer tasty bloody mary's and some of the best french toast that I have ever had the privilege of trying.
