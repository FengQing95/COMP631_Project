Art Institute of Chicago////Wow!  You are cheating yourself of cultural experiences if you fail to make this part of your life when living so close to Chicago.  I recently visited to see the "Around the World in Sketches" exhibit.  This selection of sketches from artists' and architects' papers offers insight into the travelers' personal experiences and their visual responses.  A+ and kudos to the Institute for continually delivering quality exhibits year-round.  The exhibit ends September 1st - don't miss it.
