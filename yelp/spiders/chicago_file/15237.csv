Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's is just amazing. We had to wait 35 minutes on a Monday night if that tells you anything about how good this place is. They take your pizza order before you are seated so the wait for food is much less than normal. We also got the house salad to share with sweet vinaigrette. It was delicious and was huge enough that it feeds 4 with leftovers. It was very fresh, crisp and cold.
