Smoque BBQ////The brisket is something dreams are made of, the pulled pork was bananas, mac and cheese was life changing, the baked beans were insane, the coleslaw was heavenly, really the only thing that was just kinda sorta OK was the cornbread but it's possible that the rest of the stuff was just so great that even good cornbread would just seem alright in comparison.
