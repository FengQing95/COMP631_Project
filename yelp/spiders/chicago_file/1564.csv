Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The food was good, but the check in process was so unorganized. I put my party's name in via yelp before I got there and when we were called in, we were ignored and pushed aside for more than half an hour, even though we followed check-in instructions. The hostesses weren't friendly, but the waitress was the saving grace and was the only friendly worker we encountered.
