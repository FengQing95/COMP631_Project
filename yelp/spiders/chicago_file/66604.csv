Little Goat Diner////Adding insult to injury the food took a long time to come out and the difference between the first entree and the last entree coming out was around 15 minutes. It didn't help that the last entree to come out was my burger. The positive side was I did get to try the "los drowned" because the people I went with felt bad for me.
