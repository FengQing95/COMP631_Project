Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great food and experience!  I have been wanting to dine here for a long time, so we made a reservation with friends for dinner.  Great atmosphere, excellent service(thank you James) and wonderful food.  Bone-in Ribeye was excellent.  Ordered it Medium +, since did not want to risk a too red Medium rare. Appetizers and sides are designed to share. We ordered pear salad, Caesar salad and shrimp cocktail to start.  For the sides, we ordered mashed potatoes(excellent), wild mushrooms & Brussels sprouts were really good. Really enjoyed the time with friends and excellent food!
