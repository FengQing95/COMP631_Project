Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I just got a chance to dine there earlier this week. Last time was 5 years ago. I ordered carry-out once in a while. It was packed on Monday evening. The food was good but not outstanding. We felt rushed many times by the bussers and server even if there were empty tables by us. We were still working on the food and the bussers took them away while we were chatting. It was a going away party so...Sangria was good though and still better than a lot of places.
