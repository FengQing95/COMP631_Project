Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Hands down the best steakhouse in the city. I pretty much order the same thing every time I visit which is the 42 day dry-aged ribeye, cooked Â perfectly medium every single time. The ambiance is on point, dimly lit but not too dark whereas I cannot see my food. I recommend all the sides sans the elotes style corn - no way should elotes ever cost $12! Be sure to make a reservation well in advance as it can be tough/nearly impossible to get a table if you decide to just walk in.
