Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The Paella requires a minimum of two people and you have to order assuming both parties or more wants that specific Paella, so no mixing and matching from what we could tell. We ordered the seafood one, the meat included is entirely seasonal/availability based. So ours came with Shrimp and Scallops and green beans and with a side of Garlic Aioli and Lemon. The taste was amazing and probably the best smelling dish in the whole room. The best part is the bits that stuck onto the pan, the waiter made sure to every bit onto our plates.
