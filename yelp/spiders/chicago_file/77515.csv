Little Goat Diner////I visited this diner with a group of five and we had the best time! We went on a Sunday morning and because of it's location in the west loop, it was slammed. The staff was able to get our group in 20 minutes earlier than originally expected. We were seated on the patio, which has really cute wooden tables and eclectic decor. The atmosphere was great. We were greeted by a really nice and energetic waiter who helped us with our menu selections - they have A TON of delicious choices to choose from. All five in our group chose different orders so that we could try each other's selections. I left thinking there must not be a wrong choice on their menu. My favorite was my order (of course) which was the machos nachos. My only regret is that I wasn't able to try any of their lunch selections. We will be sure to return.
