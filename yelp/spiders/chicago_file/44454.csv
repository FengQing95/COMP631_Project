Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////What Babareeba lacks in its menu it definitely makes up for in atmosphere though.  The crowd is very attractive, and our server was a very good combination of friendly and accommodating.  The staff was very helpful in refreshing our bread, filling our water and taking our plates away.  It's still a fun place to go on a weekend evening.
