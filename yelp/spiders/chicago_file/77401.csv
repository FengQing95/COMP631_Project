Little Goat Diner////The service at the table was excellent. Our server was friendly and took great care of us. However, the two girls doing the seating are horrible. I had made a 9:30am reservation. We showed up on time and were told to wait when there were plenty of empty table and booths. We waited 15 min before being seated, and I think the only reason we were seated was because we reminded the hostess that we had a reservation. I don't see the point in making a reservation if you're not going to honor it when we arrive. Really disappointed in that aspect and would've given it another star if we had been seated at our reservation time.
