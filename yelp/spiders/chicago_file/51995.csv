Smoque BBQ////Every last morsel was divine. The pulled pork was moist yet surprisingly lean, without an atom of gristle to be found. The ribs had the telltale pink ring of meat just beneath the surface that signifies an expertly-smoked rack. The texas sausage was tender and spicy. And then there's the brisket. I apologize if you have a Jewish grandmother, because this is better than hers. It is perfectly seasoned and smoked to perfection, tender while still retaining its meatiness and shape. The side dishes (fries, corn bread, BBQ baked beans, mac and cheese, corn bread) were all delectable; it was clear that effort had been put into them, which is unusual for a barbecue place, especially a good one.
