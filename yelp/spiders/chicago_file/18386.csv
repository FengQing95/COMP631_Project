Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ended up Lou Malnati's about 3 hours after arriving in Chicago and that's including the train ride from the airport and the two block walk from where we were staying. The two blocks being no accident. I was so excited to hit the door and dive into some deep dish for my first time in town. We were seated courteously and quickly upstairs and got drinks post haste. Cab and Bubbles. The service was fast, friendly and attentive. We then ordered a fabled large cheese pie when prompted, no starters or salad to get in the way. Our server said good call on that one. There was so much tasty gooey cheese and I hate to say it not enough sauce to balance it out. So it made it feel like there was too much cheese. As it being a deep dish, I am sure there is "too much" anyway, but whose to say? I really liked the crust of Lou's pizza. The cornmeal style stayed crunchy throughout the onslaught of Mozz and added a nice flavor. Next time I just have to say "extra sauce". Lesson learned.
