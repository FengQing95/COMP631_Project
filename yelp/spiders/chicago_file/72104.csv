Little Goat Diner////Breakfast - I'm the type of guy who loves quantity when it comes to breakfast food because it's hard to mess up breakfast food and it's also hard to make it much better. I also like when the meal comes with sides so that you could match sweet and salty. So initially I was disappointed to see that menu is all Ã  la carte. In addition the menu had few of the classic breakfast dishes that you would find at a place like IHOP. A lot of the dishes had Asian aspects and although I'm Asian and have grown up mixing American and Korean food, most of the menu did not appeal to me. Part of this is because I love classic breakfast dishes. So I ended up ordering Corned Beef and Hash since that was something I knew I wouldn't hate, but I was instantly filled with regret because I don't really enjoy it that much either. In fact I had the same meal at Wildberry, a place that I really like, and didn't enjoy it because it was so plain. Yet, I can honestly say Little Goat's Corned Beef and Hash blew me away. It was sooooo good. There was a lot of juicy meat and the hash was crispy on the outside, which I love. I was full from just this one dish so it was okay that it didn't come with any sides. However, I also ordered the Bull's Eye French Toast because it was something sweet and people raved about it on Yelp. It was weird, did not satisfy my desire for something sweet as it mixed sweet and savory a little too much, and is something that I won't be getting again.
