Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The deep dish itself was beautiful. The Malnati's is basically a thick layer of mozz cheese, an equally thick sausage layer, and tomato sauce. The sausage is flavorful and the tomato sauce was chunky! The Lou's is perfect if you like a more vegetarian option- lots of spinach at the base, then mushrooms, sliced tomatoes, mozz, and cheddar. I liked the amount of toppings in both BUT they were way too cheesy for me. It was my first time having deep dish so it might be typical, but I'd be wary if you also don't like cheese. Lastly, the crust had a good crunch!
