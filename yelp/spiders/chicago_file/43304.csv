Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I really want to like this place; I'm not sure why, probably because I've read such great reviews and have a friend or two who continues to rave about the food. So I've been on more than one occasion, and I can finally say, you know what? I'm finished trying! It's time to trust my palate and move on to a new go-to tapas spot.
