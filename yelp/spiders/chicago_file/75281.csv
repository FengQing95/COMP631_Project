Little Goat Diner////+Bull's Eye French Toast ($16): This was a last minute addition since everyone seemed to be raving about it. Honestly, I was not really a fan of it, but I think that may just be my preference of keeping sweet and salty separate. But looking at the individual elements and how well this dish is executed, I could definitely see why this is so popular. So even if it didn't work out for me, I would say it was a good experience and I would recommend others to check it out.
