Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////My sister and I went here yesterday for brunch. We were staying at a nearby hotel. Our wait was about an hour total, but we had heard great things so were willing to wait for a table. The service was fast and good. Like I said, we were willing to wait for a table because we had read AMAZING reviews about the food. I ordered the veggie omelette w/ hashbrowns and fruit. My sister ordered two eggs w bacon and pancakes. The food LOOKED good when it arrived (minus the white pile of hashbrowns). The hashbrowns were mushy- tasted like they came out of a microwave. Read: NO CRUNCH. The Omelette had ample vegetables, which I appreciate. Unfortunately, the eggs were overlooked and dried out. Â Fruit was fine. My sister said her eggs were good, bacon okay, and pancakes okay. Overall a cute restaurant in a convenient location adjacent to Millennium Park, but the food was perhaps not worth the hour wait.
