Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////After the last plate was dropped off and we finished our small plates, our waiter kept refilling our water and allowed us to stay and catch up after he dropped the check off. We ended up staying for about an HOUR after he dropped it off, and never once tried to push us out of the restaurant! You don't find that too much these days. It was such great and respectable service.
