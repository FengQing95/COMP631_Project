Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I brought my dinner group here from NYC when we were visiting Chicago, the food was fantastic, the staff was on point, and best part about it, my members loved the place.. I was a bit worried about a Tapas place for my group as they tend to be picky about their meals (we are a dinner group) but they LOVED it, which made my life much easier. Great for large parties.
