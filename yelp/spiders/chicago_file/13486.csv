Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place was DELICIOUS. Like stunningly so. The pizza was perfect, and the crust was to die for. Our waiter was really cool, and very attentive despite being swamped. The wait was a bit long, so we opted to sit outside despite the fact it was a little chilly. Overall, an amazing introduction to Chicago deep dish.
