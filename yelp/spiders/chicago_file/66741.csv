Little Goat Diner////We had a great meal at The Little Goat. The specials were awesome. Our server, "Savannah" was knowledgeable, comical and interactive. Her real name is Megan though. Worth asking for if she's working. I'm a very picky eater, and she got me to try the "Sloppy Goat!" I can't believe I ate goat, but it was extremely delicious. Definitely a place to check out in Chicago.
