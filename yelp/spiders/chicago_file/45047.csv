Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Like the restaurant, the menu is also huge, so there's really something for everyone. We started out with a half pitcher of the classic red sangria. Pretty good deal for $15 considering the two of us each got about 2 glasses full out of it. Fresh baked bread was also quickly brought out, and I couldn't help but stuff my face with it even though I knew we had many dishes on the way. It was just so crusty and delicious I couldn't pass it up! Our food came out at a good pace, and I was so stuffed by the time I left! We ordered the spicy potatoes, goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, braised short rib, grilled octopus, grilled iberico pork and the hand carved iberico. Out of all of these, the only one I probably wouldn't order again is the short rib. It was decent, but compared to everything else we ordered, it just didn't stand out. It's really hard for me to pick my favorite dish because it was all so good!
