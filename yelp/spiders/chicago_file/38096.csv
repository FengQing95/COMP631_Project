Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I have not one bad thing to say about any of it. I can't, it would be a sin. If you are getting steak, don't even think about looking further than the rib eye. Stroganoff melted in your mouth and fell apart just by looking at it. Corn was so creamy I couldn't even handle it. The pie was hilarious, it was 15 feet high with the whip cream.
