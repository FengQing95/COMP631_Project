Smoque BBQ////Maybe it was the long line which raised my expectations or the fact I am just a straight up BBQ snob, but Smoque was very dissapointing.  My wife and I got the ribs with the two sides (she had baby backs and I had St. Louis style) and added the brisket for $5.00.  The presentation looked good and that is where the goodness ended for me.
