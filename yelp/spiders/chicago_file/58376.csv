Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that "wowed" us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were "just good" were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus.
