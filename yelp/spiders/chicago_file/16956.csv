Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I didn't think the dip dish pizza here was that good, not sure if it was just the kind we ordered (Chicago classic) or what, but it was just average. So, I don't understand the vibe. I liked the service and the inside considering it's a very casual place but the food is not something I'd crave or want to try again.
