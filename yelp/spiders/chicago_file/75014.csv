Little Goat Diner////Started with the bread of the day, which was the buffalo cheese bread with ranch and bacon cream cheese. Subtle buffalo flavor to the bread, and the cream cheese topping was ridiculously good. I had the patty melt, which was by far one of the best I've ever had (and I've had a LOT). My wife decided to try something different, and the risk was rewarded. She had the parathas burrito - perfectly cooked eggs, sharp goats milk wrapped in crispy naan and topped with the most amazing avocado bean salad with chili pepper sauce. She could have eaten just a bowl of that salad and been happy!
