Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute has my favorite painting in it, a masterpiece by Picasso called The Old Guitarist.  I fought through the crowds and rushed past so many other amazing pieces until I found it.  It was strange, even with all the crowds not many people were stopping by it.  OK by me, I got to stand and stare at it for a long time, just silently taking in its beauty.  I was surprised at how large the painting was, I felt so tiny standing by it.  Amazing, truly amazing.  Picasso was such a genius.
