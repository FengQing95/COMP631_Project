Smoque BBQ////Best brisket in Chicago and the best restaurant operations in the city - it could be a Kellogg business case study. You order food at the counter and magically by the time your food is ready a table is available (even for a party of 5 on a Friday night). Â I was very impressed with the timing and efficiency of it all.
