Smoque BBQ////I have eaten at this restaurant multiple times. Usually for takeout but I have eaten in the restaurant as well. Each time, no matter what I ordered, the food was amazing. I definitely highly recommend the brisket tacos, the macaroni and cheese, and the bread pudding. Just the most delicious experience you can ever have. But you really cannot go wrong at Smoque barbecue if you like barbecue.
