Smoque BBQ////Smoque is soooo SCRUMTIOUS!! A friend at work told me about it and we went there to try it and it was amazing.  The pulled pork with a side of mac and cheese was delicious.  And I have never liked coleslaw until now, and only from Smoque!  No mayo in it!   Tried the beef brisket sandwich too, also delicious.  One of the best Chicago BBQ places I've ever had.
