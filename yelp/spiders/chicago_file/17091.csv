Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The Location in the West Loop, 1235 W. Randolph, is completely devoid of customer service. I was charged twice for an online order. The Manager, Jim was of little assistance, could not/would not assist me further. The only solution offered was to contact my bank. He could not find a record of my purchase, but that surely did not keep them from taking my money, nor offering a refund. Never again!!
