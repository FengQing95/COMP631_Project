The Purple Pig////Now with the great! The salt roasted beets with the whipped goat cheese and pistachio butter were great. The beets were well salted and the whipped goat cheese provided a cool flavor that with the pistachio butter really offset the saltiness of the beets. Definitely the best value we had. The bone marrow was a hearty serving that spread very well and was complemented by a large helping of cilantro, onions, and capers. Very good and I like that they gave enough on the plate to construct the balance of flavors as I wanted. The JLT was also spot on. The microgreens were fresh, fried egg delicious, tomatoes juicy, and the jowl pieces were well fried and a generous portion.
