Smoque BBQ////The best BBQ I've had north of the Mason-Dixon line.  Period.  And quite a bit better than much if it south.  Others have complained about them running out of food, which has disappointed us once or twice, but that also is an indication of HOW they cook their meat, "low and slow."  You can't produce good BBQ fast.  I crave the sliced brisket - literally melt-in-your-mouth -  while my husband goes for the pulled pork (my sandwich choice if I am in the neighborhood at lunchtime).  This may not count as health food for the body, but it sure is health food for the soul.
