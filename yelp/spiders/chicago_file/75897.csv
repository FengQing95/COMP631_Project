Little Goat Diner////We used to like this place until a rainy Sunday while place was empty basically we wanted a booth wt high chair but unfortunately hostess couldn't accommodate and would rather sit is in a community table. I don't think she understand one year olds cannot feed theirselves and I would like to see them to my side so they're not choking. Whole situation was a mess and annoying even wt the community table the could give us the end section. What kind of effed reservation systems do they have for the place? Do people book individual tables? We didn't realize the little goat finally takes reservations we would've gladly made reservations. I do feel they're losing touch wt reality. The place used to be much better, left a bad taste in our mouth. It used to be child friendly but we were left wt a bad taste and least empathic server.
