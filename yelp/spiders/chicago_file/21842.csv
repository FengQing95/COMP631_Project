Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The classic Chicago pizza and Italian food that delivers some of the best deep dish.  The cheese, crust and sauage are delicious and rich.  Extra cheese is a must! The tomato sauce can be a bit sugary, and I wish it was more robust with tomato flavor instead of the sweetness.  Good deep-dish all around but with a varying amount of quality throughout the Chicagoland area (I think the best one is in Evanton, actually).  Remember to order ahead if possible, takes about one hour to bake a deep dish pizza.
