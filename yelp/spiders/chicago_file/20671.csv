Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great service and the wait was not too bad. We thought it would be horrible since it looked like 40 people were sitting outside for food. The take away line was maybe 5 minutes and they gave away free samples of pizza in that area too. They told us on a Friday night at 7pm that it would be 25-35mins and it felt like 15. We ordered our pizza ahead of hand so we got it pretty fast and got a salad/drinks once we sat, We got the Chicago classic and the crust was amazing. There was a bit too much cheese on it but I really liked the Sausage and crust so I would order it again. Prices are affordable and it was $40 for a small pizza, salad for 2, and 2 beers. Not bad at all!!
