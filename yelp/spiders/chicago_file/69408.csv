Little Goat Diner////Oh and speaking of waiting, why is it that every restaurant in Chicago has a crazy wait?  I am from NYC, and I find that for the most part locals tend to avoid places with a wait.  I guess the people of Chicago are extremely patient, because there was a decent sized crowd waiting it out.  After about 30 minutes we were seated for brunch.  The restaurant did come outside and offer us samples of their chicken soup bread (tasted like real chicken soup!), which I thought was a nice touch.
