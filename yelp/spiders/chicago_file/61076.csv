Smoque BBQ////A friend of ours told us about this place a while back.  I have heard great things about this place so we came in for dinner on Friday.  The place was still packed after all these years.  We got the baby back ribs and they were amazing.  The pulled pork was so tender that we got another order.  This is one of the best BBQ places in the city!  We will be back since it's easy to get to; it's right off of I-90.  Parking is not good but, in this case it doesn't matter.  The food was awesome!  We will definitely return.
