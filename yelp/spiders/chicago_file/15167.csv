Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////-The "Lou" (vegetarian) deep dish:  let me just say this... No one at the table was vegetarian, but everyone liked it.  My manfriend even preferred it over the sausage-laden "Classic" deep dish that we also ordered.  This pizza was a happy marriage of delectable mushrooms, spinach, cheese, tomater sauce, and thinly-sliced tomatoes on top.  I'm not big on tomaters so I did begin sliding them off of my pizza. Sorry I'm not sorry.
