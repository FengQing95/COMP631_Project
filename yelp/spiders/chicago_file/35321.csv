Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I went to Bavette's for my birthday with my boyfriend.  He was unable to get a reservation as this place books up!  We came early and were able to get a seat at the bar.  The night did start a bit rough as an issue in the kitchen made them unable to cook when we first arrived but they fixed it within about a half hour!  The bartender was great, he was attentive and very nice!  We ordered two rounds of cocktails and all were very good.  Onto the food.  The complimentary bread is delicious!  We both got steaks with a side of thick bacon and Mac and cheese.  Everything was amazing!  I don't think I could have asked for anything to be more delicious than it was.  We received free chocolate pie which was so good, not sure if they do that for birthdays or for our Wait because of the kitchen issues when we first arrived but now I don't think I can go there and not get it, it was the perfect ending to the evening!
