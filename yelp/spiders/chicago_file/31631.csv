Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The soup was fair not really any flavor to it very bland. It didn't take long for our pizza's to come out of the oven. Our server told us that it could take up to 30 minutes for the deep dish pizza. We were all excited that wasn't that long before our orders come out to us.
