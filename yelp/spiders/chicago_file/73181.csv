Little Goat Diner////I placed an order for a sandwich and the waiter never brought it out. I understand that it was a little  busy but it was still early in the night and not totally overwhelming. He remembered all of our drink orders and brought out the apps but forgot about my entree. I asked for ONE item of food and I don't think it's too much to ask to remember to complete this order. How a server can completely forget is beyond me as THAT IS THEIR JOB to remember the  order and bring the food out to the customer. It's a shame because I've heard good reviews about this place and the server was nice but I don't think I will be returning.
