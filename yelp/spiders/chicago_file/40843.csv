Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Probably one of my favorite places in Chicago because they actually have sangria on tap. The tapas are excellent, proportionally small (hence the name, tapas). I'd also recommend the paellas which are great to share. The sangria is one of the best I've ever had. They're very generous on their servings and I'd definitely reccommend getting a pitcher when you're with a big group.
