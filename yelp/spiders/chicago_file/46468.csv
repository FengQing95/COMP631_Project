Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////It was 6:30pm, and to our dismay there was over an hour Â wait. I was clad in my Blackhawks jersey ready for Game 4 of the playoffs, so I spotted 2 spots at the bar and was gladly relieved to hear it was first come first serve. I highly suggest this as an option if you do not have a reservation.
