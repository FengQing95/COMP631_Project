Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is definitely my favorite steakhouse in Chicago! I've been here for a special occasion as well as a casual dinner and both times the experience and food was memorable. I like how the lighting is low because it allows you to focus on who you're with instead of constantly being distracted by other people.
