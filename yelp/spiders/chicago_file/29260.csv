Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza was made to order and took about 30 mins to be served. The Malnati's Â special consisted of lean sausage, fresh tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and buttered crust. Other had claimed that the buttered crust was what made Lou's stood out from the rest of deep dish chains in the city. From our tasting, I thought the crust tasted like stale, crusty corn bread. The filling was fine. Sausage was sausage, sauce was sauce, cheese was cheese. Definitely not worth wasting an entire meal for this. I will eat my papa john's, Pizza Hut, dominoes over Lou's any day.
