Little Goat Diner////Eaten here many times and only have had wonderful experiences. If you attend on a busy day be prepared to wait in line. Good news is you won't need a reservation like you would attending the "big" goat nor will the meal break your bank given it's location. They move pretty fast. Hard to pick a favorite but I have to ditto the sandwiches, fish tacos and crab. I always end up taking a small pie to go.
