Little Goat Diner////The French Toast was well prepared, and the sweetness of the syrup combined with the savory fried chicken was good, but it wasn't amazing. Very creative take on the chicken and waffle standard though. The bull's eye was the best part- a sunny side fried egg nestled in the center of the french toast. Score!
