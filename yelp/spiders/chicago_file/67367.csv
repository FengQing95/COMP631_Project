Little Goat Diner////I had been sitting at the counter seat for 40 minutes right now and the waitress hadn't been here for last 40 minutes. After the first dish came out the waitress finally stopped by after I finished the first dish. The first thing she said about the French Toast was that she will definitely check on the menu instead of saying that she's sorry about the massing up the order. The food is great, but do expect for the wait.
