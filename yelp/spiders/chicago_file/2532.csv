The Purple Pig////This is a hopping and popular place for sure.  We happened to be touring in the area at the right time, so we gave them a try.  We had no wait at 12:15pm on a Friday but there weren't a lot of spots left at the communal tables. The place opens at 11:30am, and there's always a line I'm told.   Wife and I ordered the seafood saganaki ($22) and milk braised pork shoulder ($19), and we shared them family style as we often do.  I enjoyed the flavors of both dishes, and particularly liked the tender and succulent pork shoulder.  As far as the saganaki, the mussels were on tiny side, and wife thought the seafood could have been fresher, and also found a meatless shrimp tail piece which set her back a bit on the kitchen quality.   Service was quick and top notch.  The venue was crowded, tight, and loud.  Overall, it's one of those hip places that's nice to try once, and a place to show off Chicago to tourists and visitors, but we don't feel compelled to revisit.
