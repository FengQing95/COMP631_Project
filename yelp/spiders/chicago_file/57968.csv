Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Friend arrived, we ordered so Much. Octopus, Gambas, patatas, skewers, sprouts salad, I can't even remember it all! I was so deep in conversation but he (server) just kept bringing our plates one at a time. The vibe is so great! Tons of tables, good lighting. It was packed and it was just a Monday night. I will be back sooner this time.
