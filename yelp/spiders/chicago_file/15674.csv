Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Service was terrible , food was good . The manager seemed confused and overwelmed when they got busy . this is the second time I have been at this location and will not be returning . I have eaten at the one on lincoln ave for years and service was always excellent but moved . I commented to wait staff , didn't seem like they cared .
