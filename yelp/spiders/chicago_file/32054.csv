Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I enjoyed the personal Lou pizza for a late lunch. I was sat promptly and the server was nice. I dined alone and she made sure I was comfortable. I think the personal size might taste a little different than the standard sizes (at least they look a tad different). This was my first Chicago style pizza. I wasn't overwhelmingly impressed and the personal size could be a smidge larger. However I am so happy I could try a classic!
