Little Goat Diner////Coffee shop too. Pick up a real bagel in Chicago? Get the fuck outta here, major high five for that Izzard. Oh and the food. It's good, its big, it'll help you fit your fat pants snug and look like you belong in the Midwest. BUT it's no five star diner, I'm sorry, it's just not. It's not cheap enough to justify the busted seats and fucked up linen. It's not small enough for me to be cool with Justin or Brad or whatever that hipster's name was to not get me more water or a new knife when I asked all damn day. And, for real, it's not the best breakfast in the neighborhood. BUT BUT BUT, it'll impress the shit outta yo dad when he comes to town looking for some badass pancakes and a cup o joe better than his home brew.
