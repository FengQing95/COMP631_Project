The Purple Pig////This place was highly rated on Yelp. It was my first visit here for lunch. I did not have a reservation. The inside was packed with customers, when we arrived around noon time. I was able to get a table for two outside on the side of the restaurant, which was covered and shielded with clear plastic from the elements and well heated.
