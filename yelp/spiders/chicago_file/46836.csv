Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I really enjoy the Paella ( this is a cozy rice dish from Spain a believe served in a large flat pan that usually is flavored with various herbs n spices but includes saffron.but I do miss the days when they used to get the bottom of the pan just a bit to the crispy end of things which meant you had the nice contrasting textures. Â The seafood Paella is my favorite.
