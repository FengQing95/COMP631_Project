Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Okay, I'm not sure what the huge hype is with this place. it's very overpriced. The food is pretty good, but not for the money. The place is so dark that I can't walk and have to shine my phone to see the menu. The "famous" fried chicken is coated in Bisquick- you can do this at home. There is better chicken at popeyes i promise. The burger I tried was very good, though. But I'd rather spend $9 at Fatty's for burgers and fries. It's just too much of a splurge for mediocre food.
