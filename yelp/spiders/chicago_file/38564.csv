Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I started w/ a dirty martini and I explained I like it filthy dirty and he brings my dirty martini with a side of olive juice in case it's not dirty enough. I've been to some nice places and I've never had anyone do that. Already dig him. He knows the menu through and through and I enjoyed how he was real about how much food you get, he explained that the sides are big and too keep that in mind since we had bread coming,  oysters on the way followed by, per his suggestion that we were both going w/ the bone in filet. He could have let us order away, having too much food but he explained there was going to be a birthday surprise as well, to save room for and to keep  in mind. So great!
