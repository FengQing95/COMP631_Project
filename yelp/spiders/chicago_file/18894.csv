Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We got the cheesy bread and the garlic bread as appetizers because we were all determined to tackle these carbs head on.  Our pizzas finally arrived and they were great of course.  The Lou comes with spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes and reminded me of a delicious casserole.  The classic meat pizza had a buttery crust and some really flavorful sausage.
