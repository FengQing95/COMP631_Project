Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I would highly recommend the baked crab cake and the New York strip steak. Both were delicious. We also ordered the fried chicken which was good but nothing special. Finally went for the chocolate cream pie. Again good but nothing special, maybe the royal sundae would have been a better choice.
