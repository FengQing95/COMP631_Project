Little Goat Diner////We got there around 8:00 and for two we only had about a 20 minute wait. We were seated in a comfortable 2 person booth with a great view of the place. Our server was quick and attentive. She brought waters and we ordered a bottle of Bob's Your Uncle wine..(the reason for the four stars was the wine. It was not very good, and it was a tiny bottle. In their defense it stated on the menu that the bottle was only 5oo milliliters, but I guess it didn't click for me and I was unhappy about the surprise).
