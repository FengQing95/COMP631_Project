Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ok. How do I begin? As soon as I walked in, I was not greeted by the two hostesses the front desk as they were both on the phone. The older African American lady looked up at me and put her pointer finger in the air I guess letting me know she would take care of me when she was done. The other girl was now done with her call and asked to help me. She then asked me to come around to a different laptop so they can pull the seating chart and get me seated. One of the "Managers" walked me all the way back to a 2 seater against a wall and asked if it was ok to which I responded no and preferred to sit at one of the many empty tables we passed along the way. I then sat at another more comfortable table and was greeted by one of the Bus Boys named Manuel which by the way is amazing!! I would hire him in a heartbeat!! He goes above & beyond. My waitress was very sweet although she did spill a jar of olives & juice on my Prada bag. I told her I would get it cleaned when I got home. Manuel offered me a coffee which I accepted. Oh, one of the managers walked by and was talking to himself saying... "I will never eat Paella again!" Now why would you say that in front of customers??? Â I've worked in Hospitality managing Corporate Global Events for over 15 years and unfortunately I notice a lot more than your normal guest. Oh, by the way, I was also charged for the coffee. Lol!!!! This place is always busy. The food is delicious but the service and energy you get from most of the workers leaves little to be desired.
