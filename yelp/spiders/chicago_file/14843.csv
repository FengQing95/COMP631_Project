Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have to say this place disappointed us.  The reason I'm not raving about their deep dish is I don't think there is anything special about it.  It's basically a pizza dough topped with a big layer of cheese and sausage (chose their special) with a little of sauce on top. Flavors are ordinary for my taste.  Zachary's is way better because their flavorful pizza is very deep with lots of chunky toppings along with tomatoes and sauce. I like cheese but I think there is too much cheese at Lou Manalti and not enough of other stuff. Maybe this is what real Chicago deep dish pizza is like. If so, it's not for me.
