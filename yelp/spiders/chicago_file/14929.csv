Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The place is small, so be prepared to either wait or eat at the bar.  I cannot WAIT to go back to Chicago so I can have another.  Oh - also, the place is full of people from all over... both locals and visitors.  We sat next to a few local guys and next to a few out-of-towners there for work.  EVERYONE is so chatty and friendly.
