Art Institute of Chicago////This place is just overwhelming, especially if you have only a few hours on one afternoon. I caught the miniature rooms downstairs, wandered through the medieval armor section, then spent some time gazing mostly at modern paintings... and by then it was time to go and I was exhausted. But it's an amazing museum, and seems well worth repeat visits.
