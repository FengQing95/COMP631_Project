Little Goat Diner////This is my favorite restaurant in the city, state, and possibly the continent. I once met Stephanie Izard but only before this place opened up. If only I knew the things she would do to propel the hash-brown experience to the level it is at now, I would have known that it would be my only chance to propose my undying servitude only to be paid in hash browns. Throw a dart at the menu and you'll land at one of the best dishes you've had that month. Alright that's enough.
