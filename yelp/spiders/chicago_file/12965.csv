Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I can not say that I enjoyed Lou Malnatti's unfortunately.  It was my least favorite of the Chicago deep dish places we've tried.  I liked the atmosphere of the place a lot, almost like an upscale sports bar.  The waiter was very friendly and I really wanted to like this restaurant.  We got our pizza and it looked fine but not what I had always heard was Chicago style pizza.  There was very little sauce and it was lost under a layer of artichoke hearts.  This was fine, but the sauce was very bland.  The crust was thick and doughy, not deliciously flakey like the others.  Overall the pizza was very bland and actually tasted like soap.  It was unfortunate, I don't think I'd go back.
