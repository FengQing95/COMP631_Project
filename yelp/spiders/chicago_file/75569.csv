Little Goat Diner////The little goat drink is fabulous. Smart decision in naming that concoction because if that's the drink that showcases your diner in one order, it really succeeds. It takes your standard caramel latte and elevates it to a whole new tier of elegance that the word "diner" certainly doesn't. I could write a whole song and dance to the little goat drink, but I won't. Just know that if you were to walk in and order ONE thing, that ought to be it. Yes, even if you don't like coffee. An apple cheddar soup of the day was well seasoned and went great with the delicious shrimp salad with asian flavors. The little goat drink eclipsed all of that though.
