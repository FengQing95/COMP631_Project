Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Steak (filet) was awesome, bearnaise sauce was on point. Friends loved the short rib stroganoff. For sides, I love the creamed spinach. All the excellent taste that you'd expect, but the spinach still had a bite to it, so it wasn't mushy like what you often get. The hashbrowns were okay. They came out cold and were a little greasy. Definitely our least favorite dish - they smell way better than they taste.
