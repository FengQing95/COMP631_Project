Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My husband planned a surprise dinner in Ba-Ba-Reeba on Valentine's day in 2012. I had tapas for the first time and just mind blowing. Tapas were awesome, ambiance was pleasant but very busy. The best part, they had so many vegetarian options. I am a fan of stuffed mushrooms ever since, but never found the same anywhere else. Overall loved the place very much!
