Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I'm giving 4 stars because the service was so so. Our desert (espresso ice cream) took over 20 minutes to get to us and we had to wait over 20 minutes to get our check. No apology from our server, either. I would come back again though for those bacon dates. Those were incredible!
