The Purple Pig////Our last two dishes were the Olive Oil Poached Tuna ($12) and Stuffed Squid ($16). The tuna was so vividly colorful in a beautiful presentation from the purple potatoes, green beans, red peppers, yellow quail eggs, and of course the pink tuna. This was a fun and tasteful dish to try! Now although the squid was good, it came with only 3 pieces. It was also stuffed, so made splitting between 4 people a bit of a mess.
