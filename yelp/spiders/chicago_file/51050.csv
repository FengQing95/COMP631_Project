Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My first and only tapas experience in Chicago so far, and I absolutely love it. I brought my friend from out of town here this morning and she was impressed! I've only been here during weekend brunch time, it gets filled up quite quickly so I recommend making reservation by calling or via Open table (what I did, just the night before!). We got seated immediately. My friend and I ordered the paella rice with bacon, shrimp & grits, corn beef hash, and waffles with banana & Nutella! The food came out pretty quick and what CUTE portion!! It's definitely not huge, but shareable. I'm a big fan of the paella, it hit the spot both times. Everything else was just as flavorful, except for the grits, which we weren't too fond of. I couldn't pass the $10 make your own Bloody Mary bar and take advantage of the generous toppings! I would come back to this place over and over again, I just love the idea of (delicious) food being passed around and everyone could have at least a taste of everything.
