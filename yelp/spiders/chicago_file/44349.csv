Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food was amazing.  Not exactly what I would have liked to eat first thing in the morning as it is tapas but the grilled octopus was sublimely excellent.  The baked goat cheese with points of toast had a creamy, pungent flavor that I could not stop eating.  Everything was tasty and the setting was entertaining.  I am not sure how it is on regular days/nights but we had a reservation and were seated immediately.
