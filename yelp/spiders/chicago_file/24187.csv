Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Delicious! We arrived with a party of 6. They told us to order first and seating would be about 45 min and we should order then so they can start making the pizza soon. We were seating in about 35 minutes. Appetizers ordered and arrived within 15, and the pizza 10 minutes after that. the food was all so prompt!
