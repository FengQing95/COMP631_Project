Little Goat Diner////I've given this place a couple of tries now and I still don't understand the hype (aside from the fact that it's owned by a former Top Chef). I appreciate the concept (community seating, coffee bar for waiting) but I've had much better brunch food at several other places in Chicago. Today, I had the oatmeal and hash browns. The oatmeal was awful. It tasted like something was spoiled and the texture was gritty and mushy. The hash browns tasted OK but were somewhat burnt and greasy. I left more than 3/4 of my meal untouched but the waiter didn't even ask me if there was anything wrong with my food. I won't be going back to this place. Meh food and meh service. Not worth the wait or price.
