Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////While we were enjoying our food, the manager came over and profusely apologized for botching our wait time.  He gave us his card and assured us it would never happen again, and that we could contact him directly for our next reservation.  I was impressed by this, because my friends and I never complained to anyone, we simply asked the hostess a few times how much longer it would be until we could get seated.
