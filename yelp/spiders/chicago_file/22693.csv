Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is the best Chicago deep dish pizza I've had in the city, hands down. Be prepared for a long wait to sit down but you can place your order at the time you sign up to be placed in line for a table so that your items come out pretty quickly once you're seated. We ordered the Malnati with extra spinach and onions which made the pizza even more delicious. I highly recommend this combination!
