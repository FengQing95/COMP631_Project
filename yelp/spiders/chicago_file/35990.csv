Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////One note; I think there is a wall you hit with steak. Once you have the best meat, cooked perfectly, seasoned well, it can only get just so good. So, it's hard for me to say the steak I devoured last night was "better" than the 40 day-er at David Burke's Primehouse, the exquisitely marveled porterhouse or ribeye at Gibson's or any of the masterpieces of meat at the handful of places that do it exactly right. After that, it comes down to personal preference and taste and where you feel most comfortable.
