Little Goat Diner////The look inside is contemporary yet the ambiance is extremely casual and lively. The servers are dressed in classic diner apparel and extremely friendly and helpful. The first time I went we got shorted on the fried pickles part of the fried pickles and onion rings and our server got us more. They are really helpful with all menu questions too.
