Art Institute of Chicago////I absolutely loved this museum! Wish I had more time here so I could more carefully look at everything, we only had 2 hours to quickly walk through the majority of the exhibits. The collections and area is expansive to the point that you can get lost in there without a map. Especially enjoyed the medieval armor and impressionist galleries. Staff are helpful, bathrooms are plentiful and clean. This place puts every other art museum I've been to so far to shame!
