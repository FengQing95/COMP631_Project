Little Goat Diner////Fast forward 25 minutes, we finally ask the hostess what the story is, and she explains "well, people are just hanging out, it'll probably be another 20-30 minutes." Wow...sooo....that's at least 5 times the wait you originally promised, plus, did you not think to factor in a pre-event crowd when you started giving wait times? The valet was smart enough to ask if we were headed to the game, so why should you be surprised at the fact that people were on a schedule? All of this while there were multiple clumps of 4 seats available - we weren't waiting for a private table, just anything available. Also worth mentioning that they don't take reservations, so it isn't as if we could have avoided this simply by calling ahead.
