Little Goat Diner////Visiting Chicago and had a wonderful meal at Little Goat. The restaurant in very loud, which is something I typically don't like, however my excellent review has to do with the excellent service and food. Our waitress patiently worked with a member of our party of four who has numerous food allergies. We forgot to get her name, but she went above and beyond on a busy Friday evening to make sure all of our dining needs were met. The plain hamburger with goat cheese was exceptional, although a bit too salty. I would return to this restaurant in future trips to Chicago.
