Little Goat Diner////I had a sip of a smoked pork and toffee shake. It was alright (when it was served it definitely could have been a lot colder :/ ), but again, sort of flavorless. It tasted like a sweet milkshake that maybe was a tiny bit savory if I squinted hard enough. I did try some of the peppermint mattie, which was AWESOME. It was delicious chocolate ice cream with a spicy chili pepper aftertaste.... damn.
