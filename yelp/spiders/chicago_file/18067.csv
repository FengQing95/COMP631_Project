Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////There is nothing negative one can say about Lou Malnati's Pizza.  It has a great crust, with an extraordinary sauce, and the toppings are great.  I enjoy all varieties of their pizzas, deep dish and thin crust.  I have some dietary problems but I am absolutely thrilled with the thin crust, reduced fat cheese with sausage bits.  I highly recommend Lou Malnati's to anyone who visits.  My sister loves when I send her "Lou to Go" pizzas and my nephew loves Lou's salad dressing.
