Art Institute of Chicago////I'm glad that I got to see "American Gothic" (Grant Wood). When I later viewed featured works online, I discovered the museum also owns "Nighthawks" (Edward Hopper), but it was not on display when I went. I would've loved to see that painting. My favorite Asian art piece was "The Great Wave off Kanagawa" (Katsushika Hokusai) which is a popular Japanese woodblock print.
