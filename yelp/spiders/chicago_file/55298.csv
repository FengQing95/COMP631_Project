Smoque BBQ////The restaurant was super busy when I arrived, but there were associates who were nice enough to anticipate your seating and dining needs that they actively reserve a table for you, so that by the time you're done ordering your food, your table is ready, you eat, and then ready to head out and enjoy the rest of the beautiful city! The process is so efficient that I don't know why other restaurants don't follow their method.
