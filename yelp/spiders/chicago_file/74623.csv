Little Goat Diner////I have liked everything I have had there!  Always ask what their specials are.  I have only been here for brunch and lunch.  If there is a longer wait, you can walk through to the coffee "shop" area and get a coffee while you wait.  They also offer outdoor seating in the nicer months.  The servers are always friendly and helpful with recommendations.  The Bacon Hash is YUMMY...it is a bit salty and greasy, but a great hangover meal.  The sandwiches and meals I've had are all banging with flavor.
