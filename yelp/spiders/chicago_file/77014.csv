Little Goat Diner////The uneven service and lack of attention to detail was unfortunate because there is a lot of good to be had here - but I just can't justify the wait for so-so service. I'll consider giving it another try with a bigger party and more of a festive mood, or might just swing by on a weekday morning for coffee and pastries.
