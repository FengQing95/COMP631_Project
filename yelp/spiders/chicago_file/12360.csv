Art Institute of Chicago////Absolute all start of an art museum. I always knew it was great but it took me some traveling overseas and browsing of other world class museums in Europe to realize how amazing the Art Institute is. I'd be thousands of miles away from home looking at priceless works of art and it would feel like I never actually left Chicago, which was a pretty cool feeling.
