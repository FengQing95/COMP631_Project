Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou's, I have a love hate relationship with you.... You're butter crust keeps bringing me back, but your minimal amount of sauce and ridiculously expensive prices are not cool. Ordered a medium deep dish (serves about 2-4 peeps) with half cheese half peppers/onions. Barely any sauce- mostly cheese and the veggies. Paid almost $30, Â plus tip (delivered). Not cool Lou, not cool...
