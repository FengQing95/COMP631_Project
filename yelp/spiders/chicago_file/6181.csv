The Purple Pig////Food & wine pairings here were fantastic. Truffle offerings were unreal. Loved the wine recommendations near each entree. I don't believe in making a restaurant lose their stars on yelp, but it did seem like there was a huge disconnect in this restaurant when it comes to team work. Bartender was slammed and it seems like there was no bar back in sight to help him. My entrees were dropped off without silverware, and when I asked for a fork the expo dead ass told me to ask the bartender who was obviously drowning. I looked at him shocked and then he came back thirty seconds later with a fork lol. Sometimes its easier to just do the thing instead of delegating.
