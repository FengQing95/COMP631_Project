Little Goat Diner////Another winner from Chef Izard and one that completely surprised me.  When I read the words "diner", I was expecting heavy, plain and standard but well executed dishes.  Yes I was wrong! The environment is loud but vibrant ... It bustles with excitement.  The food is global twists on classics and definitely made well with some serious speed.  It helps to have the same attention warmth to the service we saw at the girl and the goat.
