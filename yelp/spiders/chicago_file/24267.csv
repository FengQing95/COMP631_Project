Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I had very high expectations.  I expected the perfect Chicago style pizza.  And I got it!  I ordered the Molnati's Classic with sausage and pepperoni, small size that could feed two very hungry people.  I called it in, and picked it up for takeout -- and they were friendly, efficient, and on time.  I highly recommend using this service.  Its hard to descibe the crunch and flavor of the buttery crust, in combination with the fresh tomatoes on top and tons of cheese going with it.  I have no need to run around Chicago trying the others -- I'll just keep coming here for more.
