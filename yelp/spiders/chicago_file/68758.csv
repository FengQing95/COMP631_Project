Little Goat Diner////Omg. I am so happy with the creatively paired foods and flavors. I don't know what was better...the food or service! Meg H, our server, was so kind, efficient and eager to please. The manager, John checked in on us, making sure everything was ok. Â Try the potato appetizer and brussel sprouts and the chicken pot pie was amazing.
