Smoque BBQ////That said, Smoque's is flat out fantastic.   Everything I've had there has been excellent - BUT - the SLICED BRISKET IS TO DIE FOR - and the mac & cheese is close, same for the sausage.  Fries are very good also, but beware - a single order  of fries is plenty for two or three people.  The sauces range from mild to reasonably hot and are marvelously spiced.
