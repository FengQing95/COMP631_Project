Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Do NOT order the cheese squares (they WILL try to convince ) UNLESS you want fried Kraft singles bits. ALSO, do NOT order the salad if you want lettuce in there. It's mainly tomatoes, black olives, blue cheese, bacon bits, and vinaigrette. Pizza was honestly mediocre. If you're looking for pizza and can't go anywhere else, then this is good.
