The Purple Pig////Sicilian Iris - their most popular dessert item! A giant chocolate chip and ricotta stuffed fried brioche! Initially, we were going for two desserts but our server responded with skepticism - "usually people share an Iris". With his recommendation, we decided to shame and suppress our inner fatties - one Iris it is. It took about 20 mins to be made. First cut, the overstuffed filling couldn't stop oozing out. First taste - reminded us of freshly made (oversized) beignet! Drenched in warm, melted chocolate and ricotta spread - so good!
