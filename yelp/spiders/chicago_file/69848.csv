Little Goat Diner////This is my favorite place to go for a casual dinner in Chicago, anytime a friend visits I always make it a point to take them here. The food is all very unique, offering twists on classic american sandwiches and breakfast dishes. I get the goat almighty burger nearly every time I go, its absolutely massive and I struggle to finish it at times. As for dessert, the milkshakes are smooth and creamy but unfortunately very overpriced ($7).
