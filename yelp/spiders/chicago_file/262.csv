Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Great breakfast -- loved their corned beef hash with two eggs, the hash browns, and the signature berry pancakes; probably the best pancakes I've ever had.  Also, their seasonal pumpkin latte was phenomenal.  Portion sizes were generous.  All of this cost about $15 before tip, which can't be beat for the quality.
