Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We came for a early dinner before going to the airport. The hostess seated us downstairs and was very friendly. Our waiter was quick to take our order since the pizza takes 45 minutes to make. We started with a house salad which was plenty to share. We ordered their signature pizza deep dish cheese and sausage in a small. One piece was plenty for me.
