Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Now lets get the the nitty gritty, visiting Chicago from New York for the first time has caused me to look up the best pizza in Chicago. I came across this pizzeria where upon entering I was met with great customer service. A female by the name of Janine assisted me with my order and ensured that no more than i needed would be ordered. My son and I tried the bruschetta and personal pan cheese pizza for two. The bruschetta was very good however, the pizza was absolutely DELICIOUS. I am from NY and when visiting other destinations I try to food especially pizza. This restaurant has upped the standards when it comes to pizza outside of NY. I could never have imagined the brushetta let alone the PIZZA tasted so spectacular. It is a little pricey however, the price is commensurate with the level of satisfaction you will receive when trying to the food.
