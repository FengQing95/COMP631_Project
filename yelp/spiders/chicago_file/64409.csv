Smoque BBQ////This was a lot of food! Talk about meat coma. We barely finished and were pleasantly stuffed. The meats come without the sauces (sauces are on the side) but some of the meats are so well seasoned (like the brisket) that you don't need it, unless you want an extra kick. I LOVED the brisket. So tender and flavorful. Melt in your mouth good. The pulled pork was good (perfectly cooked and not dry) but seasoning was nothing special. That meat definitely needed a sauce to help it out. The ribs were dry-rub and very tasty. I enjoyed my baked beans and oil/vinegar coleslaw. The fries are a HUGE portion, even for two people. It was too much considering all the other food we got. Fries were delicious, though! Perfectly cooked with the right amount of salt. I was told the mac and cheese was probably one of the best my date had with baked breadcrumbs on top. Cornbread was good and moist.
