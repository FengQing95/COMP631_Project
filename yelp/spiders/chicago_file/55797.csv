Smoque BBQ////- Sides: cornbread, baked mac n' cheese, mayo-less cole slaw, french fries, peach cobbler, brisket chili, beans - the sides were almost my favorite part of the meal; definitely get the cobbler, which is probably the best I've ever had, and I believe it was even made with canned peaches.
