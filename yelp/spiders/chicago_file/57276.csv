Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Let me start by saying Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba has some good Â  Paella!! Like really really good! I was in Chicago and needed to find somewhere for my family and I to eat so what better place than to look on than ole faithful.. Yelp! I really enjoy tapas so I typed in tapas and Chicago and Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba popped up. We were staying approximately 45 minutes away. Something told me to call and see if they were packed seeing all the reviews that had been posted, I could tell they were a popular spot. Good thing I did because the wait was 1.5 hours. However, they do call ahead seating. This was great and they put our name on the list. When we got there we walked in, checked in and a nice couple was leaving the first come tables in the bar. The girl walked over to us and asked us to follow her so we could have their table. How cool was that, no wait! The server we had was very nice and helpful on what to order.
