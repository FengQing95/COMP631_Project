Smoque BBQ////Let me start by saying, I have hit the southern bbq trail in my travels.  I have eaten at many of  the legendary spots from North Carolina- Texas.  I have also been to the popular "authentic" bbq joints in Chicago.  FYI- Smoke Daddy sucks.  If you think Smoke Daddy is good bbq, you must think Pizza Hut is good pizza.  If we are talking about the food, and only the food, Smoque is the best in the Chicago area.  Sure, there are lines, sure, they may run out of food.  There is a reason why there is a line out the door on Wednesday night.  THE FOOD.  The ribs are awesome, don't bother with the baby backs though, the St. Louis are cheaper and better.   The brisket is great, the chicken is to die for...The only thing that I think is just okay is the pulled pork, but I don't order that when I get bbq much anyway.  The sides are all very good.   I will admit, Fat Willy's has better Mac-N-Cheese, but that's about it.  Somebody went off about the peach cobbler being peach crumble, who the fuck cares what they call it, eat it, it tastes good.  If you agree with me about the greatness of this place, you're right.  If you don't you're a pussy.
