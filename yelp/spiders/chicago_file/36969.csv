Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I really enjoy the intimate and cozy feel of the speakeasy downstairs where you can wine and dine. Great date spot or catching up with a small group of friends. I'm a whiskey/scotch girl, and I always get the Old Overholt Old Fashioned ( 3 different kinds) and the whiskey Sour, cuz trying to pick one of the tasty yet strong drinks is just too difficult.
