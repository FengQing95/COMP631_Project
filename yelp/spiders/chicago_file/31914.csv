Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Now to the food. Since we were eating all things Chicago from the time we landed, we weren't super hungry.  We started with some good ole garlic bread which is one of my favorite things in the world.  We munched on that and a Caesar salad.  We got the salad to cut through the richness of the pizza we were about to devour. Since we were visiting and our flight was the next day, we decided on a small Chicago Classic. We wanted to try what made them famous. This came with lean sausage, cheese and tomato sauce. Pretty simple but boy was it delicious!  First off, the buttery crust was nice and crispy but not too thick. They take the sausage and shape it into the size of the pizza to form one patty. Every bite has sausage and cheese. I love that they do it that way!  They serve the first piece and you get that awesome cheese pull you see in all the pics and videos. Amazing!  The small pizza was enough for two and filling. I'm more of a thin crust pizza kinda guy, but now I'm a deep dish convert.
