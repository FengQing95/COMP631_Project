Little Goat Diner////OMG I was recommended the crumpet platter or "Everything is Everything"! This is phenomenal, the flavors explode in your mouth, and what the hell is a crumpet? Only the most phenomenal eating experience ever! I thought the GOAT was Michael Jordan, it's clearly this plate at Little Goat! Food is great, and Joan is the best, she's wonderful, so sweet she's server of the year. We enjoyed the experience! Thanks Joan, for the recommendations, my buddy enjoyed his avocado toast as well! Overall, five star Chicago staple, the GOAT is taking over West loop! Merry Christmas
