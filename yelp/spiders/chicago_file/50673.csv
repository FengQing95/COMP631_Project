Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////They were busy, and our server was pretty busy, as well. Usually, I don't like when servers don't check on you often, but honestly the type of intimate environment in there calls for slow service. It's a place that you go to relax, slowly eat, drink, chat, etc. When our server did stop by, he was friendly, helped answer any questions we had, etc. The only thing that I noticed was when we asked for recommendations, I felt like he pulled an answer out of his ass and didn't really give a genuine response. With that said, we had a GREAT experience here. Tapas can get very pricey, so be prepared to spend a lot. But it's all worth it in this cute, candlelit hot spot.
