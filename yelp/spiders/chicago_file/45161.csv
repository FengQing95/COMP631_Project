Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!//// After all that I was greeted by a manager from there and he was excellent! Took us to our candle lit dinner suggested a few things off the menu and checked up on us perodically to continue to satify our needs and providing us with the absolute best service. My fiancee and I ordered 3 Tapas. The garlic shrimp, a roasted chicken empanada and some calamari. Everything was finger lickin good!!! Then the famouse paella entree came out!!! Talk about a show! The server mixed up a hot pan full of delicious rice, chicken and veggies! It was amazing to see how he served our plates. We washed this down with a passionfruit sangria pitcher! Lets not forget about dessert we ordered THREE!!! The flan was an amazing creamy custard with a clear caramel and a cinnamon hint. The chocolate pudding with a orange marmalade was perfection. Now the chocolate truffle kaluha cake was like eating a sinful slap of truffle filling!!!
