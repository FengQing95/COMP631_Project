Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have heard lots about this place but never had any real interest in coming here, so I was a little disappointed when my friends choose it for dinner on New Year's Eve. However, I found that I actually really enjoyed my experience here. I was with 5 girls and we each ordered two things and shared. Definite standouts were the bacon-wrapped dates, the chicken breast with spinach, blue cheese and pine nuts, and the stuffed mushrooms. We also tried the black raspberry sangria, which was decent, but nothing to write home about. It definitely needed more fresh fruit.
