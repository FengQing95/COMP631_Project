Art Institute of Chicago////Great for everyone! This place has such a huge collection of art that its easy to spend hours just admiring all of the different artwork. Its one of the best Museums in a City full of Museums and its great for groups, children, teens and adults. If you ever visit Chicago, you should set aside a few hours to check it out. If its the only Art Museum that you ever visit in life, it will fulfill any and all expectations. I also recommend a yearly membership. Its just one of those places that you would want unlimited access to if you frequent the loop or the city in general.
