Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is a great way to start a love affair with tapas. I have been there more times than I can count and have NEVER been disappointed. They have lots of vegetarian options (Mushroom Empanada--mmmmm) and also great meats. The sangria is delicious and can be purchased by the pitcher, glass, or half-pitcher. Brunch here is delicious and surprisingly inexpensive. They have $3 bar tapas at various times during the week--check their websites to see exact hours. Sitting in the bar is a pleasant experience and who can argue with $3 tapas? Come here with friends, order a bunch of tapas and share!
