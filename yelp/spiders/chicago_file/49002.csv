Smoque BBQ////pulled pork is the best in the city. the brisket is the second best but still very satisfying.. the mac is also the best as far as bbq places go. if you're dining in.. be prepared to share elbow room with a stranger.. it might be awkward at first but once you taste the food, you don't care about the strangers that you can't help but eaves drop on their conversation...
