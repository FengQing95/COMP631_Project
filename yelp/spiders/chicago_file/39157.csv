Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We started off with 2 cocktails which were delicious. I ordered a lillet ros√© martini while my boyfriend ordered a sazerac. We were only suppose to order wine because it was a Wednesday but the cocktail menu looked so intriguing. It sort of reminded me of Maudes liquor bar in the west loop. The wine menu was very long and we opted for a red. They also have a BYOB option but I forget the rules for that and I probably should have researched that before coming here because that might be a better/cheaper option.
