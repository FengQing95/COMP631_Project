Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The reason this dinner was such a failure on so many levels is they had the potential to make more money by actually providing "service"--we wanted to order more food, drinks, and desserts, we just weren't given the opportunity--the owner is definitely getting a letter from me about this...in this economy, I think he/she can hire far superior employees who actually want to encourage repeat business. Â  I usually tip 20% even when the service is bad, and I ALWAYS give extra gratuity when the party is larger then six... this has been the first time 18% was a sufficient tip. Terrible.
