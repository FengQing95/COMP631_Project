Smoque BBQ////Smoque has clearly become a top BBQ destination in the city and you should check it out. I plan to return and give it another try. But if you're a rib fanatic, you should consider the timing of your visit to avoid ending up with undercooked ribs that were pulled off the smoker prematurely.
