Little Goat Diner////My food came out few minutes after ordering; with lots of patrons seated, Â the kitchen staff is on their A game pushing out food fast. The fries were freshly cut, fried and delicious. The goat chili on the other hand wasn't a winner. It didn't work for this application. It was too smoky or overpowering for the fries and it wasn't the meat; I thought something in the chili seasoning was too intense. Goat chili with rice (or even spaghetti, if you're from Cincinnati) may work but on top of french fries wasn't my favorite.
