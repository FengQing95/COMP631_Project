Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We arrived at 5:50pm on a Saturday and were lucky enough to get a seat at the bar. The beer selection was decent but the sangria was exceptionally delicious (see pic below). We put the order for a pizza right away because at takes at least an hour to make. An hour and a half later we got the pizza (see pic and yes granted it was a Saturday and extremely busy).
