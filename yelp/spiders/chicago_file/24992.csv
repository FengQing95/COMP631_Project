Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First Chicago pizza from a place that I was told is one of the best in Chicago. Sorry but I was not impressed. Crust was a bit hard, tasty but hard. Positive: Service was good and our server was really nice, but foodwise, not worth it. If you live in L.A. or anywhere with a BJ's, it will do if you like deep dish.
