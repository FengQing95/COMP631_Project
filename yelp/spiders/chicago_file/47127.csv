Smoque BBQ////Their catering service is a mess.  We used to call the day before to order takeout ribs for small family parties. Now they make you go through catering. I called on Thursday morning for a Saturday family dinner and they said they were at capacity.  That's not good business.  Will never return nor recommend Smoque in the future.  Too bad. Their ribs are pretty good.  BTW, called Lillie's Q right after. Very accomondating and their ribs are right up there.  Sorry Smoque. You got too big for your britches!
