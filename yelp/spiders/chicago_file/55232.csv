Smoque BBQ////I've only been to Smoque once and really want to go back.   I found out about Smoque while watching Diner's, Drive-ins, and Dives and thought I would give it a try.  The pork and brisket was top notch but it was the barbeque sauce sold me on Smoque.  It was one of the most unusual sauces I've ever tried.  It is not thick like your bottled sauces.   It's more thin,  like water and has a slight vinegar taste to it.  What ever is in it,  it is fantastic and I wish I could duplicate it.  My only complaint would be the sides were too small.   I wish I could have had more of that fine mac and cheese.   I think anyone in search of fantastic BBQ will not be disapointed by visiting Smoque.
