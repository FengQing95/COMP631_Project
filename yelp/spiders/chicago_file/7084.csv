Art Institute of Chicago////I found myself engaged in a painting for awhile today at the art institute. Edouard Vuillard's "Room at the Chateau des Chapes" (that above is by him, but not painting) drew me in and I stood for long minutes imaging the way the light fell and the days went there. Perhaps it was more the room, I could have lived there. Nothing was planned, all was functional yet it was obviously done by the hand of man, not God or an interior designer. Possessions were where they fall naturally, nothing was clever or arranged to effect. And through each item I learned more about the painter and wanted to break the frame really, roll up the canvas and make room for it on my wall.
