Art Institute of Chicago////When we retreated to the impressionists section and they were really, impressive and yes there were people there to see these amazing works of art, and a few clods with their selfie sticks to prove to friends they really were next to a Monet or Gauguin but it was nothing like the circus around the Van Gogh's. Had the office been more concerned with people actually seeing the art and issued timed tickets instead of just jamming in as many bodies as they could, it would have made a very different...impression.
