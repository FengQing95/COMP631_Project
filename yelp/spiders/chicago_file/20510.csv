Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When visiting the University of Chicago I polled the faculty where to find the best deep dish and Lou Malnati's was the number one answer.  We have The Uno's chain by my house (Probably it is not the same as the original in Chicago) so wanted something a little more Chicagoan.  Coming from Jersey where pizzarias are as commonplace as the tourist at the shore looking for Snooky and JWow, needless to say we are Pizza snobs. I ordered the Malnati's Chicago Classic.  The sauce was savory with chunks of tomato, the cheese was a melted stringy mozzarella gooeyness, the sausage was juicy and the deep dish buttery pie crust was crisp and tasty.  Definitely worth going to if in the area and never had a deep dish.  I gave it 3 stars because service was just okay and the pizza while delicious did not wow me.  Next time I will try the other two big deep dish names in Chicago.
