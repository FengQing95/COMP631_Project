The Purple Pig////This was spectacular.  One of the most creative pairs I have seen in awhile.  But it aligns well with early American cuisine.  The portion was perfect.  There wasn't anything left and I did not need anything else to complete the meal.  A Pinot or Cab would have paired well with the meal.  However, I had a nice rye.  This is a must when you are in Chicago. If you live here and have never been you are missing out.
