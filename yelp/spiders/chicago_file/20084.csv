Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great deep dish pizza!  The place has a bustling atmosphere and a huge crowd often waiting outside the door.  They will take your name and order, and text you when to come back.  Unfortunately, the text they said they sent never came through, but we did come back in the quoted wait time and were seated pretty quickly.
