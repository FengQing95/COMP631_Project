Smoque BBQ////I can't heap enough praise on Smoque and their catering team. We hired them to cater our rehearsal dinner of 20, and absolutely everything they did was awesome. Their office team was efficient and on top of all the little details, and their delivery guy was quick, kind, and on time. In terms of the food, how could you go wrong?! The prices were the most reasonable we found, especially considering the quality of the food. The big hits for everyone were the sausage, the brisket, and the baked beans. We had more than enough food for everyone. Excellent all the way around!
