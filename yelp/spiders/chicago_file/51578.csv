Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Stuffed mushrooms: my only qualms about this dish was the heat--when it got to us, it was somewhat lukewarm, which made me think that these are made in large batches and kept hot rather than made fresh. However, the flavors were fantastic--loved the spinach and breadcrumb filling, and the cheese topped everything off very nicely. Would definitely order again.
