Little Goat Diner////The portions are pretty big, but I think you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu. I am a huge fan of the tasty asian thing (literally the name) and the french toast. I've been eyeing the Elvis Waffles, so I'll try that next time. The cheez-it ice cream dessert sounds super strange though. Cinnamon roll was just okay... not steaming warm with a melty glaze on top. Also, beware the cold brew is pretty sour.
