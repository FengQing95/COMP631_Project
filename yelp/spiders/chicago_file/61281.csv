Smoque BBQ////I live 30 minutes away. I drove 30 minutes to get there. It took me 15 minutes to find parking. I found parking. Took me 5 minutes to walk to the front. I waited in the front for 30 minutes. 30 minutes we got to the door. We opened the door to be in another line to be seated. We stayed in this other line for 20 minutes. 20 minutes we placed our order (we ordered everything, taste portions). We were immediately seated outside and waited 15 minutes for our food. We sat down and started chowing down. We finished in 30 minutes. In that 30 minutes there was a lot of drool, "mmmhmmm-ing", and pointing at the great stuff we just stuffed our mouths with. EVERYTHING was delicious.
