Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great restaurant, great atmosphere! Really good tapas as well. We came here for a friend's birthday and we really enjoyed the food and drinks. This place has the BEST sangria! I've never had sangria that tasted this yummy. If you're like me and don't like the taste of alcohol, definitely try their sangria!! Oh and their bacon wrapped dates were amazing. My friends really liked their seafood as well. The service is also really good - friendly waiters who give good recommendations. Their desserts were average though.
