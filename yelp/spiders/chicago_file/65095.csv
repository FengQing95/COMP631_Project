Smoque BBQ////I ordered chopped brisket in self-defense.  Lately when ordering brisket outside of Texas, it has been underdone and you can't eat it on a sandwich without pulling it all off with the first bite.  So chopped was my choice to pre-empt this experience.  I appreciate that they offer this choice.  I suspect they provide the chopped option as a way to use the ends and pieces that don't make nice slices.  That is not a bad thing, you get a lot of outside meat and consequently a lot of smoke and bark flavor.  This was a good sandwich, much larger than I wanted.  Because the bun is too large and bready, I just ate unsauced meat off the bun.
