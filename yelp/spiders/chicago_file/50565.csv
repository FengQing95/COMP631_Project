Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////For once, I decided to not order the paella, even though I'm sure it would have been as incredible as everything else. We had the bacon wrapped dates, the special New Zealand venison, the fried calamari, fried peppers, pork belly, and the pinxos platter. The venison reminded me of O Toro (for you sushi fans) in how it practically melted in your mouth. The Pinxos platter is essentially a sampler of all of their pinxos (appetizers) which was lovely. The fried peppers were surprisingly nice. They were a tray of a not super spicy pepper, I believe green jalape√±os, fried, with most of the heat cooked out. There was however a big red pepper, which was still quite spicy. They are in some sort of a savory sauce with course salt. If you like savory with a light amount of heat, the peppers hit the spot.
