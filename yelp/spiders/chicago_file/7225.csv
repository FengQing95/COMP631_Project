Art Institute of Chicago////My absolute favorite place to go in Chicago. Do not go during the weekend if you're worried about the crowd, and the place is large so it's easy to get lost but the people who work there are good at helping you find your place and honestly, if you like art and you want to see it what else is there to say? This is the place to go for a blind date, a meetup with friends, visiting family, a quiet afternoon, or just some beauty for the soul.
