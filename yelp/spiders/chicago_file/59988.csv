Smoque BBQ////The food is incredible, by far the best BBQ I have had in Chicago (and I have had my fair share).  The only down side to this spot is the long wait.  I have never eaten there, I have only taken out, but you have place the order for your meal way ahead of time, if not, you could be waiting an hour or so for your order.
