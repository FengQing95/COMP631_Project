Art Institute of Chicago////One of the other things membership is nice for is that you don't feel as if you have to get through the whole museum (or even a whole wing) in a day.  You can spend an hour, or less, looking at a few things, and just go back in a month or whenever, and look at some more. This is good for a person like me; I like to re-visit things again and again after the stuff has had time to swim around in my brain.
