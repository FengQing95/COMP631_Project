Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Now, the negative: we had a waitress (forgot her name, but blonde hair and funky glasses) who was just unpleasant from the very beginning.  After we had been seated for about 10 minutes and had our regular menus we asked for a wine menu.  15 minutes later we still didn't have one.  We asked again and the busboy was the one to drop it off.  We chose a wine and then spent the next 20 minutes trying to order a glass. I repeatedly tried to get her attention and she wouldn't look at our table. Eventually I went to the bar to order the wine but she was near the bar so I gave her my order. I'm not sure if that upset her but she became even less attentive.  The busboy was the one to bring out food (about an hour after we sat down) and my mac and cheese was cool so I had to send it back to be reheated, which apparently was another strike against us.  We had planned on ordering more wine but she never came back to check on us so we were left with just the one glass (which she did comp for the delay). The dessert menu was dropped off by the busboy and the waitress never came back to discuss the options. Throughout the course of the entire meal, every interaction (which was not frequent) was unpleasant and left us feeling like we were burdens for asking for basic things (wine/warm food/etc) and turned what was an almost perfect night into one where we felt unable to truly relax.
