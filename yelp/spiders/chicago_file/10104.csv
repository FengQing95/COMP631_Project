Art Institute of Chicago////I am not "art smart" by any stretch, but I did take 2 semesters of art history in college because the teacher was really good looking, I don't remember much, but in-between awkward staring sessions I did manager to learn a bit about the visual arts in a functional/historical context. Consequently my favorite sections are the Armory (swords and guns baby!), European Decorative Arts (ceramics and glassware for oldtimey rich people!), and the Ancient and Byzantine (highly ornate combs and nose rings galore!).
