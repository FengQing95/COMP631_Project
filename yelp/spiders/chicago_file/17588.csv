Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We arrive and are immediately seated, the restaurant was pretty empty at the time. Our waitress comes over probably a minute after we arrive asking us if we know what we want, we tell her we need more time. Literally three minutes later she comes back and asks us if we know yet. We barely had a chance to look at the menu and haven't even had a chance to glance at the drink menu. We order our pizza anyways, we split a sausage deep dish for two. She tells us it will take about 30 minutes, which is fine, we try and tell her we want to order drinks too, but she rushes away before we can say anything else.... so she doesn't come back at all... and then our pizza arrives. I asked the poor guy that brought us our pizza if he could get our waitress for us. In retrospect I feel kind of bad for that because I was kind of rude to him, but I was very annoyed we didn't have drinks or silverware so we couldn't eat our food and it could get cold. She then comes over apologizes and gives us silverware and we order our drinks, which we then get quickly. After that she came over a bunch of times to tries to makeup for disappearing originally, well the moment was unfortunately lost.
