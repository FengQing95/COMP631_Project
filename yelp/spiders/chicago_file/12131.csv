Art Institute of Chicago////The staff was a bit off putting. There were workers who were overbearing and lecturing to captive audiences, which was a bit much. Then there was the security guard who was breathing down the neck of anyone who was under the age of 40. Art museums are quiet, contemplative places. It's really uncomfortable to be trying to admire art in a small room with a dude just staring you down from two feet away.
