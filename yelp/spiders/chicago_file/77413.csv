Little Goat Diner////Our Waitress was amazing! We asked her which items were her favorite on the menu and all of them were on point! I ordered the Tonkatsu sandwich and loved it. The sandwich had a breaded pork cutlet, asian bbq, mayo, cabbage on white bread. The mayo and bbq complimented each other really well and mixed with the cabbage, each bite i took was absolutely delicious. I would definitely recommend. One thing to note is that this sandwich comes alone. if you order a side of fries, I think it is large enough to share
