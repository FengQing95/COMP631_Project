Art Institute of Chicago////This is my favorite Chicago museum for many reasons.  It houses the world's largest collection of impressionist art.  It's free for Bank of America cardholders the first full weekend of every month.  It's free for Chicago residents Thursday evenings from 5-8pm.  It is also connected to the modern wing so you can toggle back and forth between the two collections.
