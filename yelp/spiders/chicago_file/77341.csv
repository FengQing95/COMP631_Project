Little Goat Diner////Food was good. At least there's that. I had the Pork Belly Pancake on a scallion pancake. Delicious and sweet meat. My sister had today's special, the Fish Tostadas. Huge portion and perfectly fried fish. We shared the fried pickles: flavorful batter, very crispy and lightly battered. I also had the Goat Chili, which was spicy and oh so good! We also had a cinnamon roll brought out, which one of the kids exclaimed they "loved, loved, loved."
