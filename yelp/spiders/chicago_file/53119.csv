Smoque BBQ////Live on the south side of town where we regin supreme with the BBQ. Gotta give it up to this place...just exceptional doing it in style and on all levels. The line was long...but oh my GOD, IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT. Will reccomend & get my BBQ from this place everytime I go north. The chicken, ribs and mini peach cobbler is a must.
