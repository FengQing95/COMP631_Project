Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////No joke. Been in iberico cafe many times and food wise iberico is NOT even close to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba. The way food taste from Ba ba Reeba is like chef Ramsey (Kitchen Nightmares) would be running it. Chef in this kitchen is superb!!!! I'm a tough customer when it comes to food and it takes a lot to impress me food wise.
