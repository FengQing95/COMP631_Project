The Purple Pig////I tried the ricotta gnocchi with a half portion of beets. The beets were garnished with crushed pistachios and a pistachio butter and topped with a goat cheese foam. It was as good as it sounds. The pasta was handmade and light and fluffy; the Bolognese sauce was hearty and delicious.
