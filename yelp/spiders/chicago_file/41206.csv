Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I flew in from Boston last Saturday (didn't know about the NATO summit until we booked the flight). We heard about this place and having discovered how easy the Chicago Subways are to figure out we decided to get off at the Armitage stop and give it a try. We loved it. Plenty of seating and so laid back. No rush at all. Their menu is breakfast or tapas. No sandwiches or entrees. But if you're coming in from O'Hare and just want some snacks or a late breakfast this is the place. We had a pitcher of cava sangria that was phenomenal and aplenty and reasonably priced. Good chorizo, brisket, fresh vegetables...plenty of bread and butter to spread. Easy going staff and efficient and seemingly perpetual bussing yet not in a hurry-up-and-leave kind of way. Very enjoyable.
