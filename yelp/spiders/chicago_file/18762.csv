Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came at an extremely busy hour but they have a great wait system. Name goes down, you get a text with a link and you can monitor where you are in line. While you wait you can pre order your pizzas - genius! This made it so our pizzas came shortly after we were seated - efficient! Pizzas themselves were so good! Got the Classic and Lou. The massive amount of cheese and the buttery crust were perfect! I'd say skip the appetizers and focus on the pies!
