Little Goat Diner////The fries came out first, so I picked at one from his order, and holy shit that chili was awesome!  It had huge chunks of beef, and their cheese sauce was more like a light and creamy bechemel  (sp?) as opposed to the standard yellow goop.  I'm not usually a fan of fried foods, but these were addictive.
