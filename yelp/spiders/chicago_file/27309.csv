Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered the 'Malnati Chicago Classic' in small and it fed two people comfortably. Never had deep dish pizza before so this was a nice change. There's a layer of sausage hidden beneath the flavorful tomato sauce that satisfies a carnivore's palate like mine with each meaty bite. The presentation itself was not as 'deep' as I had imagined, but I don't care about the aesthetics of food. Overall, easily the best pizza I've ever had and wish they'd expand to Philly.
