Little Goat Diner////An improved performance from my first visit soon after Little Goat opened more than three years ago.  We stuck to a couple of now-popular staples, including the Bull's Eye French Toast and the Chickpea Salad, and they were both fantastic.  The Tempura Mashed Potatoes were a miss but everything else about our visit last week was very strong, and you get a lot of food for these prices.  Great for kids, since it's so loud in this place, and during the work week, getting a rezzie on OpenTable is pretty easy nowadays.
