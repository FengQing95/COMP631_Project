Smoque BBQ////this place is great. i've only ridden by their restaurant location--haven't gone there yet, but we get it catered at work on fridays occasionally and it's always a popular choice. i'm imagining the restaurant has a church like quality to its aroma as it always does here--must be the smoke. the chicken is great. i'd highly recommend that. good mac and cheese and delicious beans. the brisket was decent--not so much my thing--but i think that's one area that smoke daddys does better.
