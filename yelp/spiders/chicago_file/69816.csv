Little Goat Diner////So someone who loves this place for how cute it all is took me here and I had a terrible dish... I figured I ordered badly, my fault. I'd ordered a special omlette that was like Crab Rangoon style or something, just bad flavors together, and overcooked eggs and a soupy sugar sauce poured over it.
