Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As desired every dish can stand by itself, irresistibly dynamic. Unfortunately, everything is so dynamic it seems to fight for a spotlight dish. Every bite takes you higher, but there is nothing to round it out. Wonderful atmosphere, food is well thought out and has so much depth. Will return
