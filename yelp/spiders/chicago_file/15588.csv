Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The restaurant has a pretty nice atmosphere, all in all.  It gets busy but the tables are spacious and the dining areas sectioned off into smaller outcroppings.  The set up really seems to help the servers work more productively so they're not constantly running into each other.  It also breaks up the crowds so you're not sitting in a room with fifty other people, instead you may only be surrounded by four or five tables each seating two to four people.
