Art Institute of Chicago////There is no reason to visit Chicago and not spend some time at The Art Institute of Chicago. It has something for everyone, but the museum is especially strong in Modernist art. Everyone goes to see the George Seurat painting, A Sunday on La Grande Jatte, made famous by the movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off, but don't miss Edward Hopper's Nighthawks, or the rather hard to find Marc Chagall stained glass, America Windows. Really, there are countless famous works of art to see and enjoy -- unless, of course, you are a philistine.
