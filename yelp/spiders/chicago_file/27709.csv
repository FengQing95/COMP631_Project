Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ah-mazing pizza! I had never had Chicago style deep dish pizza before and now I only want to eat it. It's so delicious and good. This location is insanely busy. We arrived after 8pm and were told it would be a 90 minute wait. It turned out to only be a 60 minute wait and they do get you to preorder your pizza so it arrives at your table shortly after you are seated, but it would be good to be able to order some starters to eat while you wait.
