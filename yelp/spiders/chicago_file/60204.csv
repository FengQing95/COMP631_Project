Smoque BBQ////Basically, I wouldn't be hesitant in giving this place over 3 stars, if they fixed some of the minor problems it has, such as making the mac and cheese portions just a little bigger, and changing their cole slaw recipe away from being very vinegary. I also think they should expand to the storefront just north of here, in case it ever closes, so that they have an additional seating area. Regardless, I'll give this place another try in the future, since the sweet tea was decent(take that, McD's sweet tea crap!), and for my personal wishes of trying other menu items, such as their ribs, BBQ beans, and pulled pork.
