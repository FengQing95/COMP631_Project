Art Institute of Chicago////I was surprised to discover in addition to my old faves (the Modern Wing and The Surrealism exhibits), I liked the Medieval armor room. I'm impressed they had such perfect sets and how intricate they were. I ADORED the Miniature Room. A room full of tons of mini rooms of various eras and countries. So well done and intriguing. It was very cute too, a crowd of kids raved over each one and took pics of them all enthusiastically.
