Smoque BBQ////We hired Smoque to do catering at Emporium Logan Square for our wedding reception.  They asked all the right questions, came out and did a walk through, were incredibly professional and helpful, and had great communication.  Peggy and Mike met got all of the details set up for me and Mike came the day of with a few other servers.  They set up and broke everything down.  They were so accommodating and made it so I didn't worry at all.  My guests LOVED the food (we all did!) and we had many guests go for 2nd and 3rds.  I would hire them again in a heartbeat.  The price was GREAT, food was GREAT, and the experience was the BEST.
