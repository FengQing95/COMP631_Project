Little Goat Diner////I came here around 9 pm on a randon weeknight and was surpised to see that the place was still packed. We didn't have the foresight to make a reservation, but only had to wait 10-15 minutes for a table. Once seated, the wait staff was extremely attentive and helpful. The menu had plenty of brunch items, as well as sandwiches, soups and salads, a handful of which seemed to be asian-fushion. I ordered the apple-tomato soup, which warmed me up after traveling through the wind and rain. The soup had two unique flavors which actually worked well together: creamy tomato, with a sweet aftertaste. I often hesitate to order salads at restaurants because of the chance I might be paying for overpriced lettuce, but this place is definitely worth it! For only $7, i got a substantial caesar salad packed with fresh ingredients: romaine kale, radish, bell peppers, and beets. Once I told our server that I wasn't a fan of anchovy, he was able to modify the order so there wasn't any anchovies in the salad or dressing. The hash browns in my bf's meal were stringy and delicious. Next time I'll be ordering something more greasy and/or sweet :)
