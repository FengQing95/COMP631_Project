Little Goat Diner////We ordered the Smoked Corn Beef Hash and This Little Piggy Went to China. The Smoked Corn Beef Hash comes in a bowl with hashbrowns on the bottom, corn beef, and a bed of eggs on top of that. I was not impressed with my meal at all. It was very dry and the eggs were way overcooked. The only thing I did like were my hashbrowns. It was shredded very finely and had a crispy texture to it. My husband did not like his dish, "This Little Piggy Went to China," at all. It has a biscuit that has a Szechuan sausage inside of it. It was covered with a chili sauce and fresh strawberries as well. It's creative in theory but was not enjoyable. We liked our hash browns and smoked fries the best. My friend ordered a Jerk Chicken sandwich instead of the breakfast/brunch options and he said he thoroughly enjoyed it more than what he had in the past. The server also made a mistake and brought out fries for him instead of the hash browns he ordered with his dish.
