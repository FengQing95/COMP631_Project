Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Worth the wait.. simply put. We had a three hour wait last Sunday early evening. But the pizza was absolutely impeccable. Made fresh to order, and you can order frozen pizzas to be shipped domestically. If you've never had deep dish pizza before and you are visiting Chicago this place is a must visit!
