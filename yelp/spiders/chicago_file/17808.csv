Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Thank you for writing a review, Victor. I am glad you enjoyed our pizza, but I'm very sorry to hear about your disappointing experience otherwise. If you're open to it, our manager would like to speak with you about this. I will send you a private message so we can follow up with you directly. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.
