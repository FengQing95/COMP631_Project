Smoque BBQ////But the BBQ itself? I wasn't overly impressed. I got the brisket - half chopped, half sliced, and while it was tender and the meat itself had a good flavor, I thought the vinegary BBQ sauce distracted from the flavor. I also thought that it was too fatty for my taste, but that's just me. Mike got the pulled pork, and he liked it, but said he'd had better pulled pork at Kuma's. He might stop by on his way home from work to pick up some BBQ for himself for dinner, but I think I probably won't be back to Smoque, at least not any time soon.
