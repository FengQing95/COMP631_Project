Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This restaurant is the ideal place to go for a dinner date. The atmosphere is very much intimate, the lighting in the restaurant is dimmed and just about every single table has lit candles. The music is great as well. Upstairs they play a lot of classic jazz and down they play a lot of great instrumental music like tracks by flying lotus and many others. (We were seated down stairs)
