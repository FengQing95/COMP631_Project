Little Goat Diner////After waiting about 35 minutes we were seated.  It was a gorgeous day, we were hoping for outside seats, but we opted for first available.  No worries though, the indoor seating is prime for people watching, getting a feel for the spot-on diner atmosphere and basking in the sunlight from the enormous skylight in the center of the ceiling.  We were greeted by a waitress that knew her stuff, smiled because she wanted to and wasn't afraid to help with the menu.  Speaking of, this menu is not just a list of food they serve; it is a reflection of the genius behind that cunning little goat, Stephanie Izard.  You can see the passion for great food and how it makes for a superb experience.  Locally sourced meats, eggs and veggies, Stumptown coffee and the perfect blend of ingredients in the dishes that would make you think Walter White retired and started working here.  After much deliberation and friendly advice from the waitress we decided on the Apple Cinnamon pancakes, Fate Elvis Waffles, Big Fork Maple Sausage and a cup of coffee.  So how did it all taste?  Insert expletives here.
