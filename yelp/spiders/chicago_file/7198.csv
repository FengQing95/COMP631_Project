Art Institute of Chicago//// I spent summers of my teens in art classes at the museum. The Spanish Baroque section is the first time I cried for art. I've spent literally, hundreds of hours of my life in that museum, and I still can't get enough of it, the pieces are so well chosen and these are major works of art that you see reproduced all over the world. Of all the museums in the world, I am in love with this one, mostly because it is one of the symbols of one of my favorite cities in the world, Chicago. GO BULLS!
