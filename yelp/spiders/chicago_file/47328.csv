Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////OVERALL: If you're not sitting at the bar (but rather, in the main dining area), you'll probably enjoy this place. Definitely order the baked goat cheese and paella valenciana. I don't think I'll come back just because there are so many other tapas restaurants to try in Chicago.
