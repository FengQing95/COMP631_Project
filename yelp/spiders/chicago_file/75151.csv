Little Goat Diner////Food: The food was the bomb dot com. We started with the bloody mary's ($11) each which were delicious and spicy. For an appetizer, we got the tempura mashed potatoes ($5), they are a must have if you haven't tried them before. My BF got the corned beef hash, which was flavorful and delicious. The same goes for the braised beef sandwich ($14) I ordered, it was savory and tender.
