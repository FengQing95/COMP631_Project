Art Institute of Chicago////Having said that, this is a sight to behold. Wether or not your interests run in the direction of art simply doesn't matter. Anyone with eyes will find something of interest, something to admire, to ponder or simply glimpse. The sheer magnitude of this museum still stuns me. The architecture, the paintings, the sculptures all offer a story and history that is amazing. On your way to your favorite art, you pass other art, and you stop a moment perhaps because you haven't seen it before or because it catches your eye. This is why I suggest spending a day here.
