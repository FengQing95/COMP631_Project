Smoque BBQ////You can't have it too much as the food is pretty rich and it stays with you all day...you smell like smoke, you burp smoke, you taste smoke.  Actually went here on a date....bad idea!  It is the least romantic thing one can do.  So I like to go here with my family when they come into the city.
