Little Goat Diner////My friend and I ordered the ritz crackers with crab dip, the pork belly sandwich, the breaded pork chop sandwich, and the smoked fries and spouts for sides. What...we were hungry! Crab dip was good and cheesy. Sandwiches we spilt in half so we could try both. The pork belly sandwich with slaw on top was fabulous, the flavors worked well together. The breaded pork sandwich was huge. I don't know who would be able to finish that. The breading was light and the bread was soft, good combo. The sides were also great. We shared a whoopie pie for dessert.
