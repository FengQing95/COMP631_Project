Art Institute of Chicago////One thing I wish the Institute would embrace more is the desire for interactive exhibits.  Children and adults alike, especially if they are tactile-inclined or are visually impaired, literally have nothing they will connect with as much as others in the museum, and that seems like a massive oversight given the prominence and prestige of the Institute.  I have to believe something can be done in the massive space of the Institute to mitigate this.
