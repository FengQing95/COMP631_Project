Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It even held up through the night to the next morning WITHOUT REFRIGERATION!  OK, clearly I don't recommend this on your normal dining experience, but we didn't have a viable fridge in our schwanky hotel, so kept it in the ice bucket for a wee little bit, then left it in the box till morning; and lo and behold, it was a delicious breakfast!  Who would have thought!
