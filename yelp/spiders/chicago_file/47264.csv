Smoque BBQ////We are so thrilled we picked Smoque to cater our wedding- can't recommend them highly enough. We knew we wanted an (affordable) buffet, stress-free planning, and a casual feeling for our wedding at a music venue in Chicago, and most importantly, we wanted the food to be delicious and not "wedding food". Smoque delivered- and then some. We got married in October and our friends and family are still talking about how great the food was ("best food we've ever had at a wedding")! We had been to Smoque to eat in person several times and knew the food was great- and it was just as good for 160 people. Peggy and Xiomara were an absolute pleasure to work with- they put up with tons of questions and changes in set-up at the venue at the last minute and were unflappable and solved every little issue that came their way. They were very responsive and easy to get in touch with throughout the process, and I appreciated how clear the pricing and staffing structure was from the beginning, so there were no surprises. We opted to have them stay and staff the buffet for our guests which was completely worth the extra cost. Â And it was SO affordable.
