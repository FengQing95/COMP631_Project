Little Goat Diner////My co-workers and I had sandwiches & coffee at the grab-n-go counter. We were impressed with everything. The turkey, shrimp, and veg sandwiches were all off the charts delicious! Kelsey, who was friendly and helpful, took our order and pointed out that Stephanie, the owner would be making our sandwiches today. He also invited us to check out their new roof-top patio! We are definitely coming back to do a happy hour up there. What a view!
