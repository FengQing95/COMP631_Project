Little Goat Diner////In any case, Little Goat's diner-style menu will set you back only an arm; if you want to lose the leg, too, try to score those Girl and the Goat reservations. The open, white-washed dining area is particularly nice on sunny days, especially contrasted to Little Goat's down the street corner neighbor, the much tastier Au Cheval. So it's definitely a nice stop to make when you're making the rounds with your tourist friends. And despite my begrudging comments about the cost, the bakery actually makes some really fantastic breads. So there's that.
