Art Institute of Chicago////The ambiance of the place is very soothing and I love spending time here, even if it's just sitting on a bench examining one piece in particular (...and since I'm usually there after work and in heels, you better believe there is a lot of bench sitting). The Institute is a school as well so there are always art students doing studies, and every time I see their talent I get a little jealous. But overall, great place for any art lover and the employees are really nice, too. If I move into the city itself one day, I'll most definitely get a membership.
