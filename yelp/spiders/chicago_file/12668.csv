Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Maybe it's that I was born and raised in New York.  We knew it'd be a wait for a table for seven, and it was.  90 minute wait for a table.  They handed us a buzzer, a menu, and told us that we could pre-order, since the pizzas take 45 min to cook anyway.  45 minutes?  What the hell is this, a pie?  Oh wait.  It is.  So we decide, order 3 pizzas (we were taking some home for 5 more people) and had a drink at the bar.  It gets really crowded, so expect to be bumped.  One of the guys in our party nearly accidentally took off the hostess' head with his elbow while telling a story.  They brought out a few thin-crust pizzas cut into bite size pieces for folks to snack on, which was a nice touch.  The whole time we were waiting, there was a distinct smell about the place.  The buttercrust, the copious amounts of cheese.  After about ten minutes, I placed it.  Chuck E. Cheese.  That's what this place smells like.  Minus the sweaty sneakers.  We sat down, ordered another pitcher of beer, and out waiter brought out our pies in less than ten minutes.  He served us all, and I made it through three slices, which was plenty.  It was decent, but I think I still don't get what the raves are all about.  Don't need to come back, for the wait, or the food.
