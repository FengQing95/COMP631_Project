Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Being a lover of Napoletan-style and NYC-style pizza, I had little to no interest in trying Chicago "deep dish"-style while visiting this gorgeous city - not to be a snob, but the idea didn't appeal to my appetite. However, we started out the day early and hunger struck, so we checked this place out, unaware that it's an institution. Being early and not realizing how lucky we were, there was no line and we were quickly seated. The attentive waiter informed us that if we were getting deep dish, we would have a bit of a wait for the food to prepare, so we split a sizable garden salad as an appetizer. The pizza, which we also split, was absolutely delicious - fresh and perfectly seasoned tomato sauce, excellent, crisp and tender crust, and tasty mozzarella. I couldn't believe I almost missed out on this treat and I highly recommend it to those who, like me, are otherwise close-minded about deep-dish. No, it's not traditional, but it's its own thing. Also, it is absolutely filling and powered us for the rest of the day. I recommend going early, because soon after we were seated, this place filled up very quickly! Hope to return one day!!
