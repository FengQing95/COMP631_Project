Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Well no need to go into details since everyone below already has already said the same.  But I will confirm that was the best steak I think I have ever had.  Seafood tower was very fresh, if you are in the mood, I would spend the extra $50 and get the Maude's tower.  I have had it at Maude's liqour kitchen and it's 3 tiers of amazing seafood.
