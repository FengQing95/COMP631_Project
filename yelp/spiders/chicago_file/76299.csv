Little Goat Diner////A dairy-free menu. On the one hand, it's reassuring to know that my food will, in fact, be dairy-free, and I appreciated that. On the other hand, the menu was rather limiting and communicated that the kitchen wasn't willing to make simple alterations - for instance taking cheese off a sandwich - to make a regular menu item dairy-free.
