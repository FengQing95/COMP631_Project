Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My first Deep Dish Pizza in Chicago, though not my last thanks to the Chicago Pizza Tour (seriously look them up, they're great)! Made this our tourist pick of the trip and came by on a Thursday for an early lunch. I really needed this to go well. I've tried deep dish pizza a few times out in California and they were all pretty terrible.
