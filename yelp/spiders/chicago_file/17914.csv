Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So i gave this place another shot because the manager was so kind to me and my part after my bad experience. we came back and the food was way better then last time. but it still took the servers a long time to always get back to us. if i ordered an appetizer it would take 25 min. if i ordered a water would take 10 min. i also ordered a cup of coffee and that also took 20 min. don't get me worn the server i has was awesome !! she was super friendly and nice but i just think that this place needs to hire more servers honestly. also orders some cake and that took about 15-20 min. good place but just needs some help in certain areas. but i would come back
