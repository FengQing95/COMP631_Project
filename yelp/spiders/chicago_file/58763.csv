Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!
