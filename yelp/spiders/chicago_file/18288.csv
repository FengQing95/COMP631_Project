Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Perhaps I'm just a New Yorker at heart, but Chicago deep dish is not really my style.  The pizza was average, but definitely way too cheesy for me.  The cheese was overpowering and I didn't get to truly taste the other ingredients, like the sauce, the sausage, and even the crust.
