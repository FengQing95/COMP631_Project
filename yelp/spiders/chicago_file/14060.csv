Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The crust on this pizza is so good, the sauce was great, I would have given it another star but this time when our pizza arrived the center was luke warm.  When you have a deep dish pizza it has to be nice and hot and gooey other wise you are chewing in to a block of cheese.  I've never had this problem so I will definitely be back, my other visits have been fine and I feel that anyone can have an off day. The waitress wasn't too happy when we asked her to pop it back in the oven but she did and it came back to the table perfect.
