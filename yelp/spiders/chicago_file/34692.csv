Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The server made my night feel at ease. Â He recommended us some of the dishes as well as explaining some of the fancy name from the menu. If the food is great but the server aren't good then it wouldn't worth it sometimes. Anyway, the food was delicious! Orders a sample of the oysters they offered, crabs stuffed avocado, lamp chop, and filet mignon. The meat were very well cook! The filet mignon was the best because not only is it well cooked, they have a really nice creamy dipping on the Side that help make the steak much more flavorful :).. I'm not a fan of lamp so I can't comment on how great it taste but my partner said he would give a five star for everything :).
