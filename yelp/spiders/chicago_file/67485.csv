Little Goat Diner////Just moved to Chicago and tried this hip diner for an early afternoon meal.  It was busy and we had to wait about 20 minutes but it was worth it.  Menu is robust and you can choose breakfast, lunch or dinner and people are nice.  We chose breakfast; I had the bulls eye french toast and my wife had the burrito. Both were very good; each meal includes regular breakfast items and they combine those with other foods that creates great flavored pairings.  Highly recommend and will go back to try other items.
