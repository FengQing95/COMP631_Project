The Purple Pig////I heard this place, chain?, was really tasty. so for a afternoon snack my friends and i were walking by and decided to see if they had a table available. my goodness even at 3pm there was line. It was about a 15-20min wait, and we didnt have anything else to do, so we decided to wait. We got seated on a tall sharing table. Tightly squeezed next to other people, it was a little awkward and very hard to talk to one another because the place is loud. I sat on one of the ends, and my chair kept getting bumped by people walking behind me, a little annoying, but the place is cramped so i guess its expected. i scooted in as much as i could, but i guess it wasnt enough.
