Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////deep dish pizza was supposed to be amazing right??  it was the first time i had it and it was ok.  it took a long time even though they said itd only take like 30 min?  and they serve it for you when it comes out.  we got one with pepperoni and..stuff.  and another with vegetarian ingredients.  i had a piece of each and it was pretty filling.  felt like i was eating a casserole and not a pizza, but as far as pizza goes, it wasnt bad.  a lot of cheese and well cooked.  probably would try another place next time just to see wassup with deep dish.
