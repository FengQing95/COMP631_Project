Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////By far the best dining experience I've ever had! I work in the service industry and I was really impressed by the service and food they gave. Our server was really great I'm not sure what her name was but she looked Asian and had what looked like orange or pink flowers tattooed on her right arm. She was great very knowledgeable with the menu and Leo the bar back was also great he stopped by a few times to refill our water props to him! My boyfriend did an amazing job for picking this place for our 1 year anniversary special. Also the host stand was very accommodating we had made our reservation for the wrong date which was our fault and they still got us in. Everyone was awesome thank you!
