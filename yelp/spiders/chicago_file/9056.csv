Art Institute of Chicago////Absolutely amazing.  This should be at the top of everyone's "must see" list in Chicago, even if you don't consider yourself an art lover.  I'm bored with many art museums, but I still loved the Art Institute and wished I could have spent an entire day here.  One morning just wasn't enough.  The museum is both huge and crowded, but the staff are happy to make recommendations for specific things you might like if you're short on time.  While there are some very famous works of art here, which are likely mentioned in other reviews, be sure not to miss the America Windows.  They're in a back corner away from most other exhibits, so when I was there, few people found them.  However, they were easily my favorite thing in the entire museum.
