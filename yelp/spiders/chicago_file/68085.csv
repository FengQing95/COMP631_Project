Little Goat Diner////With a little new restaurant forgiveness there is no way I couldn't give this place 5 stars. I will plan on coming in at an earlier time the next time I visit...which will be often. I am very glad they are in my neighborhood, and feel that they add a lot of value to the place I call my hood.
