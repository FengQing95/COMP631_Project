Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I ate at Café Ba-Ba-Reeba for brunch this past weekend. I really liked the idea of breakfast tapas! It was nice because I could order a couple of the "Pintxos" or bite-sized tapas and they're enough for one if you order a couple. I ordered the yogurt Pintxos and the citrus French toast and that was too much food! The vanilla yogurt and granola was SO good, I cannot describe it with justice. Who knew that simple yogurt could be so delicious! It was a thicker Greek yogurt, with just the right amount of sweet. I got the entrée size of the French toast and I regret it. It was good but I didn't need that much of it. I did like the goat cheese "butter" that came with the entrée though, and doesn't come with the Pintxos. In general though, I didn't think it was that great and I don't think I'll even be ordering a Pinxtos version of it in the future. In hindsight I wish I had ordered 3 Pintxos. I would also count the egg Benedict as essentially a Pintxos, maybe 2 bites instead of one though! My friend ordered it and it looked amazing, I will definitely be ordering that when I return! It's also definitely on my list to come back for dinner.
