Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Regular pizza is now ruined forever, because the pizza here is out of this world. We got the Chicago classic and it was heaven in a pan. Butter crust is everything to me now. Wait was shorter than they told us it would be- they obviously have a great system going here. Looking forward to my next trip just for this pizza!
