Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Very good deep dish pizza. Personal size looks pretty small but it's filling. My boyfriend got the small (larger than the personal) and he was pleasantly stuffed, as he's a huge pizza fanatic. He says it's great pizza and he's from NYC, so I think it's opinion holds some weight. If you want some Chicago deep dish, you can't go wrong here!
