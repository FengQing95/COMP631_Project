Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Although it is a deep dish pizza, it is definitely not as thick as Giordano's which has an extra layer of dough on top.  Giordano's is more of a stuffed pizza vs. Lou's which is more traditional.  I prefer Lou's as I don't need to be eating another layer of carbs.  Lou's crust is soooo buttery awesome as well.
