Smoque BBQ////There's a lot of great BBQ in Chicago these days but Smoque continues to be among the best if not the best.  Everything is good, but they are Texas-style which means brisket is king. And their brisket is hands down the best - very tender, very flavorful.  Worth going out of your way if you crave great BBQ.  It can get backed up during peak hours so plan accordingly.
