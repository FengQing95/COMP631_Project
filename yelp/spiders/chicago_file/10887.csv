Art Institute of Chicago////This is a terrific museum with an in-exhaustive amount of contemporary and international arts, sculptures and what-have-you. If I lived in Chicago, I would come to the exhibit, month after month and listen to the audiotapes and experience the way art is meant to be consumed (explained via a small uncomfortable pre-recorded tape).
