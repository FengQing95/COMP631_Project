The Purple Pig////Gnocchi: Even though it's not an Italian restaurant, they do pasta REALLY well. I found the flavors of the tomato sauce to be much more robust than Eataly and the texture of the gnocchi to be much more pillow-y than most other Italian restaurants. Spring onion pesto was my favorite!
