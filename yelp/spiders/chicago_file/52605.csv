Smoque BBQ////The portions were Texas-sized. The meat was tender, juicy, and smoked to perfection and the BBQ sauce was just the right amount of smoky and sweet. And for dessert, I had peach cobbler. It was the best peach cobbler I have ever had. The peaches were warm and juicy. The crust was crispy, yet moist and sweet.
