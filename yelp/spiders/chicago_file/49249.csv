Smoque BBQ////Long overdue for an update.  Since the original post (and we have been to Smoque no less than 20 times since it opened) we have gone back probably 5 times for carryout. The brisket is STILL the meat of choice here (my husband gets chopped, I get sliced). Maybe once in the last 5 visits have I noted that the meat was a tad dry - but it's always flavorful and generous. While we still like the fries, the integrity of them (like anywhere else) is lost when you do carryout and they are not piping hot and crunchy. Our new favorite?  The beans are awesome as is the brisket chili!  Highly recommend.  In the final analysis...we still love Smoque and it's definitely the best BBQ place in shouting distance of 60657.
