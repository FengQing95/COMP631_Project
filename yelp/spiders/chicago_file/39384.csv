Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Earlier in the meal, the fabulous Hope stopped by while the bf was in the bathroom and asked us if were celebrating anything, so I mentioned his birthday. When we were done with dinner, she came and asked us if we were interested in dessert but the boy was too full to even contemplate it. She still surprised us with a dish of the most delicious salted caramel ice cream complete with a celebratory sparkler. She showed up as we were devouring it and said she 'had to do it! It's your birthday!' to him which was so sweet of her. I liked that she went a little on the lighter side and brought us regular ice cream (although it really was the most sinfully good ice cream I've had in a long time).
