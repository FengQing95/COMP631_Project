The Purple Pig////I have been yelping my way around the Midwest for the last few days and tonight the purple pig got a five star out of me. We waited an hour for a table, and place on Friday was insanely packed and loud. That said, wine prices are fair and the menu prices are fair. I ordered a few yelp suggested things , but the pork shoulder and the gnocchi were life changing. Truly not like anything I have ever had. I am in town for two more days. If I can get another pork shoulder before I leave, I will. Really, really, good.
