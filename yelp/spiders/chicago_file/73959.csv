Little Goat Diner////All in all, a very solid choice for dinner. I'd probably come back to try some of the other sandwiches or the other breakfast items. Their breakfast menu looked amazing. I'd recommend this place, especially for its creative and interesting menu. There's something for everyone. With West Loop, restaurants can really come and go, but Little Goat has been around for a while and I think it's become a staple in the neighborhood.
