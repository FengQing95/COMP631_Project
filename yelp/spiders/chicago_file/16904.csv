Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm going to start by saying Lou's is my favorite deep dish in the city. The buttery crust is the best. BUT besides the food I have to say James is a phenomenal waiter.. Knowledge about recommendations, set great expectations on time, and provided a professional amount of wit and charm to our evening without interrupting our girls night. Go to Lou's on Wells and ask for James, you won't be disappointed.
