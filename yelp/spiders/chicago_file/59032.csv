Smoque BBQ////I love their St. Louis style ribs (I like my ribs meaty!), pulled pork, sausage and sliced brisket. Though everyone talks up the brisket, its my least favorite of all that. Their macaroni and cheese is pretty damn good, the chili with brisket is good as well. The beans are great as is the cornbread. I'm not a fan of the vinegar-y and onion-y coleslaw though. I wish they had collard greens, that would be amazing and they would be just about my IDEAL BBQ place then.They have pretty good peach cobbler too.
