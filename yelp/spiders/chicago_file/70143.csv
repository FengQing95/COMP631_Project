Little Goat Diner////We walked into Little Goat around 5:30 on a Tuesday afternoon.  The place wasn't too busy so we choose to sit at the counter.  You feel kind of special.  Our server explained the menu to me because it was my first trip to Little Goat.  Luckily, I choose quickly and settled on the Sloppy Goat.  My friend went for the Mac N Cheese and Chili.
