Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Café babareeba is genius disguised as a tapas restaurant for some.  First their location, in the heart of Lincoln Park is a perfect zip code for such an ambitious venture. The building itself is even better with its turn of the century style The neon light sign that says "Tapas" acts as a for what's to come, sort of like a book's cover that says "book."  Done to look like it was imported from Spain its ideally decorated for a restaurant that offers so many options on cheese. As you walk in two people taking reservations double as a tour guide.  I say that because the restaurant does intimacy like engineers at Cadillac specialize in fuel economy.  After they escorted me through the maze of rooms which gave me a full view of the restaurant which was fully occupuied by high income mostly Caucasian locals who probably see no difference between Spanish people and the Mexican's that serve them.  On this night I sat behind a well behaved baby who like everyone else had to listen to the man eating with his or her's parents.  Once you get the other noises out of your system and read through a pretty extensive menu it's easy to get yourself fired up for some Spanish grub.  Its kind of a waste of energy though.  The food itself is nothing special although the presentation tries to be.  Apparently the style of tapas that were given to us hailed from the region of Spain where they served food on blocks of wood cut like a cribbage board with wax paper on top of it.  The prices taken on a per tapa basis seem reasonable until you get the bill at the end of the night which makes you see the capitalist spin on such a socialist culinary tradition.  The sangria was good and was the most authentic of anything I consumed that night but that's coming from someone who would find something good to say about anything with alcohol in it.   In summary,  Café Babareeba is perfect for anyone looking for a faux tapas experience in an atmosphere that makes you feel like the other 300 people you have just discovered the next best
