Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We don't typically eat at corporate restaurants (this is one of 40+ owned by Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises), but Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba was convenient to our B&B after a long flight, and my girlfriend had eaten here before. Fortunately, we had reservations; as others have mentioned, it can get very crowded, even on weeknights.
