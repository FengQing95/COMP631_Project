Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Mmmm... buttercrust. That's really all there is to say that hasn't already been said. It's Chicago-style pizza. It's better than Pizzeria Uno/Due. My boyfriend and I disagree on where it falls in regards to Gino's and Giordano's, but it's somewhere up there. And, like I said before... mmmm, buttercrust.
