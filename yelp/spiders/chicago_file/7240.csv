Art Institute of Chicago////One of the world's great museums. We've been members for years, but are now enjoying taking our grandchildren to visit as well. They love to sketch the paintings and then have a look around the fun gift shop afterwards. The (relatively) new wing is a fantastic addition. A must-see for any visitor to Chicago.
