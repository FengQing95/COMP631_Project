The Purple Pig////My husband and I went here for his birthday dinner and it was worth the almost 2 hour wait... Yes, 2 hours! Luckily, we were able to get on the waitlist and walk around for a bit before coming in. Once we were seated, it made sense why this was a hot spot to be on a Saturday night. The restuarant looked really chic and elegant although seating was a bit tight to better accommodate more guests.
