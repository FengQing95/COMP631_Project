Little Goat Diner////The sides nearly stole the night... The tempura mash potato was so well done.  Creamy starchy interior was perfectly battered and fried to a greaseless crunch that was still crispy 10 minutes later.  Is it indulgent yes but whoever came up with this idea ... I love you.  The fish sauce pea greens was a nice Vietnamese influenced dish.  I really liked the sweet and pungent savory fish notes to the crunchy greens.
