Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went for dinner last night for a GNO. Great service was appreciated. Super packed night but felt our order came out spaced just fine. Recommendation of their specials were perfect, especially the lamb chops. Pomegranate sangria was refreshing and delicious. This place never disappoints.
