Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Apparently patrons are able to bring a bottle of their own wine without a corkage fee, and are instructed to share a glass of wine with another table. We received a lovely glass of pinot noir from another table, and some glasses of champagne to celebrate our anniversary. I love the idea of this and the sense of community it can create.
