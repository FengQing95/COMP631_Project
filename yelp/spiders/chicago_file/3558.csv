The Purple Pig////Ok. We were here during the Chicago marathon. Typically not a long wait but it was a 2.5 hour wait the night after the marathon.Thanks goodness for honest on the wait time..  We hit the Purple Pig at lunch time  the following day and this place bustles. We ate at the bar which is a a great place to observe and see incredible foods come off the line. It is not a place to have a deep and meaningful conversation but more to relish the fantastic tapa style plates. The cheeses are incredible and our waitstaff knew her stuff here. Plates ordered were the orecchiette and the pork belly. Omg. The pasta would have been perfect alone. Delicate  and a great scooper of a light sauce w sausage and rapini. Pork belly was tender, moist and flavorful. Impeccable service. Super helpful w guidance  and a great hope for return. A food experience. You will not be disappointed.
