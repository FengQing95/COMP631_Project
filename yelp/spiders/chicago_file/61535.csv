Smoque BBQ////The food is excellent. The employees are all helpful and courteous. A five star barbecue joint. I could give it an extra half star but I do not know how to give a half star. The problem is that they are not equipped to handle peak times. Which is when everyone wants to eat right? If you are dining in they sit you one on top of another. No elbow room at all. Too close for comfort. Better yet. If i get ribs , a salad, and some pork. And the guy with me orders some food because he is hungry. Our food does not even fit on the 4 square foot table we are sitting at. And if it is busy at a peak time. There is nowhere to sit.  Like, Hello? Where do I sit down with my food? Out side in the cold? Take it to go. And if you call in at a peak time to take it to go. They tell you they are too busy to do take outs or there is a two hour wait for take out..It does not affect me but these guys loose more money than they make. I go less often, and so do other  people I talk to. Jut because it is not worth all the extra trouble. You got that guys. No one wants to eat here on a Friday or Saturday night. Or even on a Wednesday at the peak lunch time. They have been here a while. Time for a newer bigger spot. And then it is a 5 star location. I will give them that....
