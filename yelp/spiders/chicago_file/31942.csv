Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ended up getting a small "The Lou," which is basically your super cheesy version of a veggie deep dish. I definitely liked the buttery and super crunchy crust. As for the toppings and sauce themselves, they were all super flavorful. The toppings were many. But I'm not sure if I was blown away. I sadly thought that the deep dish I got at Blue Line here in CA was more impressive.
