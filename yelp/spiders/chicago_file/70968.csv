Little Goat Diner////Here is an example- my boyfriend ordered the Fat Elvis Waffles and a bit into our stay our waiter came to let us know that our cook wasn't quite happy with the way his order had turned out, so he was re-making his waffles and that in the meantime they wanted to give him his choice of another food item on the house. In that act of honestly and generosity they definitely won us over with their customer service and I know that we will be back in the future to enjoy more of their creative meal options.
