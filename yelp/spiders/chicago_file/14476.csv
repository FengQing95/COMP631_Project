Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////P.S. One thing to note is that if you go when it's busy, be expected to wait a while.  The great thing though, is that once you get your name on the list you can grab a menu and figure out what you want - and then you can put your order in with the host/hostess so you don't have to wait as long for your pizza once you're finally seated.  Great idea!
