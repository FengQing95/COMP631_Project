The Purple Pig////This place definitely seems like a cool spot to hang out with some friends. Mind you it gets busy though. I was kinda glad it was only 2 of us. I think prices are fair given the type of restaurant, service, food presentation and atmosphere. I wouldn't say cheap, but fair. Will definitely plan on revisiting this place if I'm ever back in Chicago.
