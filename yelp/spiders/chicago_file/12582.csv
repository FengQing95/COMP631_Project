Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Got delivery tonight and was very disappointed.  Instead of a pizza with a nice crunchy and buttery crust, I got a huge soggy mess.  I had ordered it uncut and it arrived exactly in the hour I was told it would, but it didn't seem to help.  The crust was like mush, the sauce and toppings were poorly dispersed, and it was lukewarm at best.  I ended up heating slices up in my oven which helped crisp the crust and gave me an idea of what Malnati's probably intends their pizza to taste like.  Wanted to give 2 stars because it arrived on time and that it didn't taste all that bad after a trip to the oven, but one shouldn't have to cook the pizza they get delivered.
