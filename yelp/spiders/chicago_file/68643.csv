Little Goat Diner////OMG the fish tostadas, nachos, and tempura mashed potatoes are so good! I don't know what to say about this place other than you need to go. I've never been to Girl and the Goat but this is a great place if you don't want to have to make reservations months in advance. Casual atmosphere.
