Little Goat Diner////If you're with a group, be ready for a wait. I was alone both times and I wasn't too thrilled with one of the hostesses the 1st time around. I walked in and said I was alone, and she said sure, give me a minute and we can fit you at the counter... So I stood and waited for about 15 minutes. At the point I asked the other hostesss how long the wait was going to be and she handed me some menus and sent me over to the counter right away. SO yeah, I dunno what was going on there, but it was kind of annoying.
