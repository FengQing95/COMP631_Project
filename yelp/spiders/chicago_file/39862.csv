Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Went here for an anniversary celebration. We had made a reservation a week in advanced, but when we arrived we were told that it was full inside and the only available spots were outdoor seating. Luckily there were heating lamps which made it bearable, but it did make the food cold which dampened the experience a bit. Other than that, the food was top notch. We started off with warm sourdough bread served with butter. The slices were huge! I also tried the fresh oysters (never tried oysters in my life) and it was quite interesting. Very flavorful but definitley and acquired taste. The baked goat cheese... SO good and filling. It came with garlic bread and the cheese mixed with the tomato sauce was delightful. For the main courses: bone in dry aged rib eye with bone marrow, and truffle mac n cheese. I didn't care much for bone marrow (my bf wanted it) but it definitley was melt in your mouth good. We got medium rare for our ribeye. I think I was pretty full tbh by the time we got to the steak. But it had copious amount of flavor and was super tender. The mac n cheese and chocolate pie was probably my biggest takeaway from this place, and will probably be the main reason I come back. Definitely recommend trying these items.
