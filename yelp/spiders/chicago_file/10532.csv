Art Institute of Chicago////The greatest art museum and museum in general I have ever been to.  I feel like I could come here twenty times and never see it all.  It is THAT big.  My personal favorites are the impressionist wing (super crowded and filled with super iconic works) and the contemporary art section.  (Super weird, super cool.)  You can find pretty much any style of art from any era from any country- that's how extensive the collection here is.  Not to mention the building is beautiful from its marble entryway to its modern wooden staircases.  Even if you have just dabbled in the study of famous works, you will see something you recognize, or maybe something you recognize but didn't know the name of.  I can't wait to return here once more in January.  Also, I had the thickest Greek yogurt parfait of my life here.  It was pretty much the consistency of soft serve ice cream.  11/10.
