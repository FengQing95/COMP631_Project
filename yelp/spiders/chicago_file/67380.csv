Little Goat Diner////Service was fantastic, our servers were attentive and helpful. The atmosphere is designed to be a little upscale but feels relaxed and casual. A clean and fun place to eat. Although this just reminds me of Tyler Cowan's rule from an Economist Gets Lunch about trendy, good looking restaurants opened by famous chefs where the food quality nosedives after the first several months of being open.
