Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This was the first "nice" restaurant I have been to in a long time, and maybe it was the company, but I really enjoyed myself. It is much larger than it looks with 3-4 big banquet halls sized rooms to fit many people. The only thing I didn't like is that they don't like half your party come and sit down before everyone arrives. My girlfriend and I got there 10 minutes before my friends and we had to stand in the hallway. We were sat in the back when our group arrived and downed some Sangria. Now, I appreciate my drinks strong, and though these weren't TOO strong, still delicious. The tapas were also very good, with a wide array of different flavors and meats. The empanadas are to die for.
