Art Institute of Chicago////Dear Art Institute of Chicago. How do you justify having an entire Asian art section and nothing from the Philippines? Illinois has the third-largest population of Filipinos after Hawaii and California. And the only Asian-American group that outnumbers Filipinos are the Chinese. So yes, there more Filipino-Americans than Japanese-Americans, Korean-Americans, even Indian-Americans. Not only should your Asian art collection showcase more modern artists, but you also would be wise to move beyond China, Japan, Korea, and India, and enrich your collection to reflect the people around you. My friends and I enjoyed your museum, but we were all disappointed after looking at every single piece in the Asian section and realizing Â that we were looking for something that wasn't even there.
