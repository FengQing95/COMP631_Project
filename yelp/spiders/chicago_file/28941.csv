Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were seated at 7:40pm, which we were happy about because it only became more crowded with people waiting for tables. Bar seating was scarce. Our waiter came by with waters, introduced herself, and explained the menu. Appetizers, Minestrone soup, salads, deep dish pizza, and thin crust pizza. We took no time to decide. The menu was easy to decipher.
