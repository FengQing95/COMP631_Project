Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My friend's favorite place for pizza.  I'm definitely a fan of the deep dish here.  The only reason I give it a four instead of a five is because it's not particularly unique or different than any of the other very respectable Chicago deep dish locations in the city.  I love when a restaurant is clearly able to differentiate themselves and Lou Malnati's could easily be the same as any of the other dominant pizza places.
