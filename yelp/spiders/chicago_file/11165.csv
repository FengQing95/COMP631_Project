Art Institute of Chicago////I hope they shut this place down. The people who run it should be all fired from their jobs...I use to come here all the time and every time it is the same. Nothing has changed. BORING!!. They don't even run good exhibits anymore. And the price of admission is outrageous. I have seen better artwork displayed at an art fair show. I don't see why people even donate money to them. They must have some real suckers..I heard they dumped all their good employees so they can budget cut for the people who have no responsibilities and cant even work. People that have been working their for a long time. I won't support any non-profit organizations anymore. Especially this one.
