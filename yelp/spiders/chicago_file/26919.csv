Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's is hands down my favorite pizza shop in Chicago. The best deep dish pizza ever! The buttercrust makes everything that much better. I've also had their fettuccine Alfredo and wings, and I wasn't disappointed. Everyone rants and raves over Giordano's pizza, but Lou Malnati's definitely has them beat!
