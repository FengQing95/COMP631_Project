Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Quite possibly the best steaks in chicago.  Side dish portions are large and extremely good.  Everything from the Steaks on down to the bread and butter are done fantastically.  Love the vibe and atmosphere in the basement as well.  Very romantic and chill.   Look forward to dining there again.
