Art Institute of Chicago////This is a wonderful art museum that is family friendly. When we went into a special exhibit, an employee quietly pulled me aside to let me know of some images around the corner that may not be appropriate for my two children. I appreciated this, and the way he let me make the call of what was appropriate or not. When my children took a break after a couple hours of viewing the very diverse collection, they tried to lay down on a large bench, but another employee told them they had to sit up. I'm not sure why they could not lay down for a bit? Great little gift shops by the two entrances for souvenirs. There are so many don't miss well-known, and lesser-known art pieces. There is a lot to see as this diverse art collection of paintings, sculptures, ceramics, furniture, etc. I can definitely see why The Art Institute of Chicago is one of the best in the world!
