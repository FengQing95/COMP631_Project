Smoque BBQ////Best. Low and slow bbq ever. EVER. Brisket is soft and flavoured just right, beans are smokey and full of bits of brisket, fries are excellent and seasoned well. Apparently they're also the ONLY thing that's fried in there so it's also really gluten friendly. Beans are also not made with flour as a thickener so that's gluten free too! Platters are served on half bake sheets and lined with wax paper and come with a slaw side and two styles of sauces. Carolina and Memphis. I am more partial to the vinegary Carolina. It's a very limited menu and the place is better for it. It was crowded on a Friday night but the staff is friendly and the service is quick. They even clear your trays for you when you're done. Must return the next time I'm in town to try the ribs and other meats.
