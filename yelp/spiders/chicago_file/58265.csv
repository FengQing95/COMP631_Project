Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My favorite restaurant in Chicago! They always have the most amazing Sangria that is so fresh and no syrups. The paella is also soooo worth the wait and absolutely delicious. It is also soooo big can definitely eat between 3 people. All tapas are great, the spicy potatoes are amazing. I live so close which is dangerous bc I always want to go!
