Smoque BBQ////I drive from Wisconsin and pick up my Mom (who is either in a wheelchair or using a walker depending on how she's feeling) and we drive to Chicago just to eat at Smoque BBQ. The food is absolutely worth the trip. We have never been disappointed and we've been there at least 5 or 6 times. The chopped brisket sandwich with mac n cheese is fantastic. Very tender meat with the sauce on the side so you control the BBQ level. Note-- We finally realized that we can call when we are on our way and place the order for our food so that our order is ready when we arrive. This saves time so we don't have to wait in line for our food. Marvelous!!!
