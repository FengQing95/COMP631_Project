The Purple Pig////Creative combinations of fresh, quality ingredients made for a pleasant lunch on a rare, warm early-spring day on the outdoor patio. I recommend sharing, as we did, in order to try as many dishes as possible (unlike the family next to us at the communal table who had someone with them who clearly wasn't into sharing)..Charred cauliflower was our fave. We also enjoyed the Eggplant Caponata With Goat Cheese and meatball sliders. I'm usually underwhelmed by restaurant meatballs, but these are the exception. We had ordered the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder, but it was never delivered. So, when the bill showed up with it included, we informed the waitress, who we also had to flag down repeatedly for menus and then our drinks. So, a star lost for inattentive service..
