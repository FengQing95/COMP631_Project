Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////cafe babareeba is a spanish dream come true. the food is exquisite and a must-visit when one is in chicago. plus, the sangria pitchers (especially Â the passion fruit sangria) are life-changing and enhances any of the plates that you order. you order plates tapas-style (plus the paella if you choose to get it, but get ready to eat fewer tapas because the paella is hefty and will very quickly fill you up) and there is a HUGE selection to choose from -- i personally recommend the patatas bravas if you've never had them.
