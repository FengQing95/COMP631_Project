Little Goat Diner////Omg this place was so delicious!! One of many stops on our day adventure, we decided to break for lunch and stop in. All of us got a variety of dishes but I got the shrimp salad that had apples, red peppers, blueberries, tortilla bits and so much flavor. Every bite had a great combination of citrus flavor, shrimp and crunch. The salad mix of arugula and spinach provided a nice bitter counter balance and nothing was wilted or spoiled.
