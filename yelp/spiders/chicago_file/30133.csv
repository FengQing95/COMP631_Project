Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Alright alright alright, this place was pretty busy for a Tuesday evening, but why wouldn't it be for this famous deep dish pizza. Our wait time to sit was about 35 min and our wait time for the pizza was about 55 min over the original wait time (ordered about 10 min after we got in queue), so this wait better be worth it! Service is definitely not at par and overall wasn't impressed. The pizza was pretty good, but that's it. After we finished our pizza, I asked for the half eaten only large pie to go and the one slice from the other pizza thrown away. Waitress comes back with a check and the one pizza slice in a box. I asked her she misunderstood and said - sorry sir we already threw it out. Well, she didn't provide compensation for her error. I was unhappy when she said - sorry can't do anything for ya. A man with a love for cold pizza gets told - sorry we threw your pizza away - a pizza that I waited just under two hours to get. The one star is for the pizza because it was fantastic, but everything else is a 0.
