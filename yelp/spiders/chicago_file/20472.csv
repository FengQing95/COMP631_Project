Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza itself had mushrooms spinach and tomatoes (we opted to go vegetarian) and was quite tasty. However, coming from Houston, I feel that we've had pizza as good as this, if not better. That's not to say that we didn't enjoy this meal very much and the pizza was delicious, but for some reason I was expecting an out of this world, ethereal food experience. I would come back again.
