Smoque BBQ////Let's be honest though, for those that don't love a great smoky rib, or one that doesn't simply fall off the bone (read Twin Anchor style), then this might not be for you.  However, if the smoke flavor is what you're looking for (combined with great rubs and sauces), look no further.  Plus, while you are at it, be sure to at least try their sample portions of the pulled pork (nice and chunky), and sliced brisket (super moist/melt in your mouth).  Both of them were equally as phenomenal.
