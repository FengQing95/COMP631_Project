Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place was amazing. Their food was great and their staff were super friendly and even humored me and spoke to me in Spanish. Their food (I got chicken empanadas and paella) and I just wanted to keep on eating it and keep on eating it. The sangria was pretty good too. I would say this is a good place to go with the girls and maybe even a first date.
