Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The sides need a paragraph of their own!! The sides come in a large portion, but everyone was delicious! The brussel sprouts should not be missed!! They are charred and have parmesan on them, best i've ever had! The truffle mac and cheese was also unbelievable with a moderate taste of truffle. So cheesy and delicious. We also ordered the roasted garlic mashed potatoes, a little salty, but very creamy. Finally, we had the pommes frites which were crispy and served with a garlic aioli.
