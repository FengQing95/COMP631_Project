Little Goat Diner////Of course... there's been a lot of hype for this restaurant over the months past. I finally went over to west loop to try it out. Not having to wait for a table was definitely a plus but I have to admit that our table location was crappy and way off to the corner. This resulted in less than average attentiveness by the waitstaff and the feeling of being after thought.
