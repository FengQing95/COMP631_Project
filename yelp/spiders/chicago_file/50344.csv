Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Absolutely love this place.  I'm from Chicago but just moved out to SF and when I hear that someone is going to visit Chicago, I always recommend Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba.  The atmosphere is fun with the laid-back tapas style and very cutely decorated.  The menu has something that everyone will love and the prices are great too.
