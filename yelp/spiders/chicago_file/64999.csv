Smoque BBQ////If you're eating in, your food isn't started until your table is ready. It was super busy when we arrived and took maybe 10-15 minutes after ordering to get our seats. It's a small place with a lot of people. Food was ready about 2 minutes later. It's an energetic scene with a diverse group of people.
