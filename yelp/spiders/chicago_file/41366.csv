Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We went as a big group of 12, so we ordered a lot of food. We ordered patatas bravas, queso de cabra al horno, emapanada de setas, croquetas de pollo y jamon, datiles con cocino, emapanada de carne, calamares a la plancha, and paella de mariscos. I thought everything tasted good, but not amazing. The paella was very disappointing though, dry with few seafood.
