Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Here's what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I'm picking Bavette's. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there's something about Bavette's that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again.
