Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The tapas here are varied and great. My personal favorite is the garlic potato salad, a traditional dish, that's packed with flavors of garlic, chives, and dill. The beef tenderloin with horseradish was perfectly cooked and the horseradish sauce was fresh and strong. And I really dug the chorizo plate for something a little less flashy.
