Smoque BBQ////Finally went early enough to not have to wait to get in. Smoque has the best BBQ I've eaten since living in Texas. Had a sampler platter which included brisket, pulled pork and Texas sausage. Paired with lovely browned Mac n cheese and cornbread this meal brought me back to the BBQ I remember eating for so many years. The brisket was so moist and delicious there was no need to cut anything. Simply fell apart on your plate. They have 3 different sauces all wonderful. I preferred the spicy which was tangy but added a nice touch of heat. Â I can't wait to make my next trip to Smoque which will be very soon!
