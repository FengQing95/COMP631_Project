Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I went for the Chicago Classic with sausage pieces instead of the whole patty.  Lamar was very engaging at the bar while I waited for my pizza.  I learned that at Malnati's there is a 1 to 3 hour wait every day Monday through Sunday.  I had arrived around 12:30 and the place was about quarter full but 30 minutes later the place was packed and the bar was hopping with marathoners and spectators.  I think if a place has a 1 to 3 hour wait every day it tells you a lot.
