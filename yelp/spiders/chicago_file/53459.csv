Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Amazing service, atmosphere, and I can't even describe how good the food is. I've been there for brunch and dinner and food during both times are perfection. The cafe is extremely accommodating to large parties but be sure your entire party is present or else you can't get seated. There is also sangria on tap which is interesting. It's located in a fun area of the north side of Chicago also!
