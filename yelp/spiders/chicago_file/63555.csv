Smoque BBQ////As for the BBQ, I decided on the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich option, which I got half pulled pork and chopped brisket. Both were amazingly flavorful and juicy, and had a good amount of fatty juice that made it extra tasty. I also sampled the sliced brisket which is truly a work of art, gleaming pink meat with a beautiful charred black outside.
