Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is the place to go for Chicago style pizza, if you ask the locals.  I am not a fan of the deep dish, but here, I can vouch for the crispy butter crust and the ridiculously rich and bright tomato on top.  I hesitate to call it sauce because it's so flavorful, it's almost like a reduction of vine ripened gorgeousness.  That said, I didn't love it.  We had the Classic, which has a layer of hammered sausage which was way too much blanched boingy meat for me... but my husband loves it (although he says he doesn't need another of these for 10 years, so yay) and too much cheese (sacre bleu!!) but not enough of the tomato.  For me, I appreciate that this is the best of its genre ... a genre of which I'm not fond ... if I had to do it again, I would do a build-your-own with extra sauce (the Classic has extra cheese) and I think the ratio would be better for me, who likes regular pizza.  THEY ALSO HAVE REGULAR PIZZA which we did not try.  We had a salad and split it, a couple 'o beers and oh yes did I mention we were there St Patrick's day around 4pm and only waited about 25 min for a table so GREAT service and organization. Dude at the bar was fun and jocular and not stressed even though I would've wanted to kill everyone around me, so wow they were great people in there.  I'm not dreaming of the food, but it's the best of the thing that it is and I'd definitely go back next time I'm in Chicago.  Deep dish, I don't love you, but at least now I get it.
