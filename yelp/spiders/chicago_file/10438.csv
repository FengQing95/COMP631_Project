Art Institute of Chicago////I caught one of my favorite overheard exchanges of recent years in a modern sculpture room at the Art Institute of Chicago. "Am I allowed to sit here?" asked a boy of his father. "No," said the father. "That is art." The father paused for a second then added, "That artist just died." I sympathized with the son. I'm not that knowledgeable about art either, and when you're on your feet for hours (taking in an incredible range of priceless, beautiful art), everything looks like a chair--it's really a creative interpretive response that we should all applaud.
