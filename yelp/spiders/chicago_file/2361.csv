The Purple Pig////Based off of my experience, Purple Pig gets a 4 instead of a 5 because of the obnoxious waitress we had. It was raining when we went to Purple Pig, so my bf let me wear his rain boots. They were too large for me so when I got new ones and gave them back to him, he put them on the wrong foot. The first thing our waitress said to us as soon as we were seated was, "JUST SO YOU KNOW YOUR SHOES ARE ON BACKWARDS" (caps to exemplify her loud tone). That could have been whispered.
