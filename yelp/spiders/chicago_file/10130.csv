Art Institute of Chicago////The museum has a great collection and I could spend hours roaming its galleries! If it wasn't so warm inside and so beautiful outside, I probably would have stayed longer. You are allowed to take pictures (pictures of the pictures!) as long as you turn off the flash, which is great because there are some really beautiful pieces. Make sure to keep your eye out for some of the more famous pieces, American Gothic, Sunday in the Park with George, Nighthawks, The Old Guitarist (which a security guard pointed out to us is actually a painting on top of a painting, so look for the woman's face right around his head) to name a few.
