Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////OK, back to the start: email responsiveness was good.  I was late making a booking, and they were full in OpenTable, but nonetheless - and aided I am sure by my needing to eat at 5 p.m. - they found me a table happily.  The setting is dark heavy wood and Victorian, well-suited to a steakhouse.  Bar service on arrival was a tad supercilious, but to be fair I was ordering only a seltzer water as I waited for my dining companion and it was nothing overt - more of a snarky 'don't get too rowdy now!' attitude :-).  Table was available very promptly, and service from that point on was pretty good: not hovering but attentive.
