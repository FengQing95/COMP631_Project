Little Goat Diner////I was very excited to try this place after visiting the Girl and the Goat many times an absolutely loving it. I was severely let down though. The food is nothing better than what you'd get in a standard diner but with a premium price. Portions were very large and it was too heavy, greasy and fatty. I sampled both the Patty Melt with goat meat and the Fish Tostados, and both under-performed for me. Â I did not feel well after dining here. All the components are there for a great brunch spot, I just feel its not executed well. I did very much enjoy the Tomato and Apple soup however and that was a highlight of my meal.
