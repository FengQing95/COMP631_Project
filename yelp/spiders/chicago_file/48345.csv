Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////If you're looking for a fun place to go on a date or with some girlfriends, cafe ba-ba-reeba is the place to go. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, and the food is delish. Plus, for sangria lovers, it doesn't get any better than this. They have 6 different sangrias on tap, and they always have a seasonal special. If you are lucky enough to get the pomegranate sangria on special, I highly recommend it.
