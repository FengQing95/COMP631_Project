Art Institute of Chicago////This is a must see while in Chicago!! I would recommend to choose the areas you want to see first if you are on limited time. You could spend days here, for this art institute large and provides great learning for adults and children. For adults and children, there are audio accessible by the art institute app or you can purchase a player at customer service to get the in-depth scripts of collections. The staff is especially helpful and are eager to show you around if you get lost.
