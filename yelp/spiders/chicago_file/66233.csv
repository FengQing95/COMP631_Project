Smoque BBQ////We drive 40 to 60 minutes to come here and boy is it worth it. BBQ dinners sandwiches and sides plus dessert.  Try the sliced  or chopped brisket 1/2 chicken pulled pork and 2 style of ribs.  The fries coleslaw Mac n cheese are killer. Texas sausage, gumbo chili too.  Tacos on Tuesday are fantastic!  3 kinds of sauces the spicy Memphis is the best!  Go there with a big appetite the portions are great for the price
