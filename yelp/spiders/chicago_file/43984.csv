Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of my favorite spots in city! The food is always on point. I haven't been disappointed every time I go. For a while I would make time to stop by every time I was in city. They have some of the best sangria. Their bacon wrapped dates are a must. I love the shrimp they serve too. With at least 3 tapas and sangria you should be good. Oh yea ! Don't forget to try the potatoes
