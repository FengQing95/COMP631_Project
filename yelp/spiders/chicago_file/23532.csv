Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were asked to place the order for our pizza before we even got to the table to make sure it would be ready in time.  We ended up getting a deep dish with tomatoes, bell peppers and onions.  The wait was cruel. We weren't waiting that long (maybe 45 min especially in a crowded restaurant), but the smell of pizza permeated the room and made us start to drool.  When the pizza finally came out, I was disappointed with the crust.  It didn't have much flavor and I think the pizza could have used a little bit more tomato sauce.  Other than that, I didn't have any other problems with the food.
