Little Goat Diner////This place is hoppin'! Even with a reservation, which I would highly recommend making, you will likely have to wait to be seated. The food is gourmet diner food- decadent and artery-clogging and oh-so-delicious. My friend and I each got a cocktail, both of which were well-prepared, and split two menu items- the Bull's Eye French Toast and the GARGANTUAN Goat Almighty burger. Both were fantastic. The french toast/fried egg/fried chicken combo was a hit. And that burger- goat burger patty, braised beef brisket, and pulled pork, topped with giant onion rings- wow! It was insane in the best way! Though I did start getting the meat sweats halfway though, ha! I wish we had even a tiny bit of room for something sweet, as their shakes looked amazing. Next time!
