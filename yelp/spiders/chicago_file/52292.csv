Smoque BBQ////It really is not a big space, so although it's BYOB and their staff is very friendly, if you're really hungry or in a rush you may be better off calling ahead and ordering it to go (although I've had to wait for an hour for pick up before - so I guess that can go either way).    Whatever you do, just get there and enjoy some fantastic BBQ!
