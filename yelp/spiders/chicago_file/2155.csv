The Purple Pig////I don't normally give five stars but this place is definitely deserving. My wife and I came here with our two boys who are 4 and 2 respectively. For that reason I was a little nervous. The staff was unbelievably friendly and knowledgeable. The service was probably some of the best I can remember receiving anywhere and I'm from the south! The food was also very unique and equally delicious.
