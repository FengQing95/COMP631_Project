Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Obvi, they have a fabulous cocktail and champagne menu. I had the champagne smash and it was wonderful. There's lots of small ice pebbles at first but it melts down and makes it perfect. If I didn't have to get up so early in the morning, I'd get another one but I try hard to be a good girl during the weekdays.
