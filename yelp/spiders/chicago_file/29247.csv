Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my first deep dish pizza in Chicago and the ingredients on the pizza were really good but the crust wasn't anything special. I got garlic butter-crust, but I feel like they forgot it...even without the garlic butter- crust, it had a hard texture. I salute Dominos and Pizza Hut for creating a fluffier butter-crust and I am not even much of a bread person saying this.
