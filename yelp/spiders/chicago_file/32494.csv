Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visiting Chicago and a friend took me to Lou's. I had never had Chicago style deep dish before and I don't usually like pizza sauce. This was delicious! The ingredients were fresh and masterfully prepared. I was very impressed and will be returning with my family on my next visit to Chicago. Cal, the server, went above and beyond for us and we felt valued and taken care of. I can not recommend this establishment more.
