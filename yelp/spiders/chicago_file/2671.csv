The Purple Pig////My favorite restaurant in the city. Can't visit without ordering the bone marrow to start. The octopus is always a safe bet. Pig fat rosemary garlic roasted almonds are to die for (when available!). Pasta dishes are delicious. Berkshire shoulder dish is yum. Don't leave without ordering the Sicilian Iris for dessert!!
