Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////HOLY CRAP. Each SLICE is 730 calories. I had four of the 8 the large came with ... yeah, that's 3600 mg of Sodium. 200 g of Carbs. At least I got my 140 g of Protein? Haha, yeah just some side commentary on the lack of nutritional facts on pizza. No wonder we're so fat as a country.
