Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza arrived hot, oozing cheese all over the place.  The sausage had good seasoning, the tomato sauce was nice and chunky, and Buttercrust was crispy and buttery just as the name implied.  It's definitely a heavy pizza but at the same time didn't seem overly so either.
