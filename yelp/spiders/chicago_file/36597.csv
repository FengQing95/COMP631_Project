Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place is one of a kind and has to be either 1 or 2 on my list.  As soon as you walk in this place is amazing.  (if you are lucky, ask for to sit downstairs)  I have been here a number of times with my wife and friends and each time it has been outstanding.  Great wines and steak.  They have a nice menu for the Veggie crowd.  For a nice dinner with friends or a date night place,  This is the place to go.
