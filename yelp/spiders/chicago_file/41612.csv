Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Unfortunately I find most other things fried, or sautéed with an oppressive, heavy-hand of olive oil.  Example 1, octopus & potato a la plancha: potatoes were fried and the peppers and octopus were swimming in olive oil.  Octopus is such a delicate protein, all of the oil masked masked the fresh flavor I was seeking!  The only notable thing about it was that they actually cooked the octopus correctly--- too bad they ruined it with too much oil. Example 2, fried green peppers & coarse salt:  one of my favorite tapas to order wherever I go---- except once again, here they are swimming in oil. Put a paper towel under those things after your fry them or something!  It IS possible to fry things w/o excessive grease.  Example 3: prime sirloin, asparagus, shitakes & yukon potatoes.  Again, ENOUGH WITH THE OLIVE OIL POOLS AND PUDDLES OF BUTTER!!!!! The meat was ok but the veggies were doused in fat. So sad!
