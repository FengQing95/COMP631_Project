The Purple Pig////My husband and I walked in around 430 in a Tuesday and were seated right away. They had heated outdoor seating and indoor available. We had ordered the salt roasted beets which were delicious and could pass for dessert. The eggplant caponata was also delicious and I would order again. Also ordered the pig ears which weren't anything special. They kind of reminded us of the French fried onions. The Bavette steak was also cook perfect for my husband and he had no complaints about it.
