Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my first "Chicago deep dish" and I must admit I was kind of expecting the dough-full crust like the deep dishes from fast-food places or other pizza joints.  To my delicious delight the pizza was flavorful, ooey-gooey, with the authentic cheese that stretches further than you can reach to break it... and the crust was not too doughy at all.  It's kind of hard to explain without ordering one yourself, but it's almost as though the pizza is cooked in a deep dish to hold in all the wonderful sauce, toppings and cheese more than because the dough actually rises so much it needs the high sides.
