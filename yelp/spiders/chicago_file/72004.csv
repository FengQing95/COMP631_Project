Little Goat Diner////I ordered a patty melt the first time I went to Little Goat and last night I ordered the American burger. I have to say, Little Goat doesn't get credit for their burgers. They're actually really damn good. They're better than a lot of burgers I see on top burgers of Chicago lists.
