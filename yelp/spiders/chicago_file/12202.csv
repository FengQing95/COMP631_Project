Art Institute of Chicago////The only negative thing is that some of the staff's are rude. As your walking along the museum there is one of two staff members in each of the rooms. It's so sad that they just stare at you no hello welcome nothing but cold hard stares at people. But negative vibes and people don't steal my joy.  It's a wonderful museum with amazing collections and paintings  from all over the world. It's well worth the visit.  One of the most recommended museums in Chicago. It's a work of Art
