Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We had our anniversary downstairs. Food was outstanding. Service was top notch. We had a surf and turf option. We shared crab legs and a bone in filet. Was very romantic with the mood lighting. I do recommend requesting and reserving a table downstairs many weeks in advance.
