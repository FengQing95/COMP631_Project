Smoque BBQ////We got a combo for $22 of 2 half racks of ribs (1 St. Louis, 1 baby back), 2 sides (peach cobbler and BBQ beans) and it comes with coleslaw as well. To that we added "a taste" of sausage and of chopped brisket, for an additional $3 each. So, for $28, we really got quite a lot- and took leftovers home! Next time, I'd really want to try the chicken quarter. WOW, did that look phenomenal!
