Little Goat Diner////Our food offered memorable flavors, ample portions, and deft execution. Fried pickles and onion rings melted in the mouth with an airy texture and light crispness, pairing beautifully with accompanying curry mayo and house ranch. The pork belly pancake could've used more scallions, but was nonetheless intensely flavored with bitter bok choy slaw, crisp-tender pork belly, and hoisin sauce tying everything together. My bulls-eye French toast tasted revelatory, balancing the sweetness of strawberries and smoky barbecue syrup with eggy brioche, crispy fried chicken, and rich, runny eggs. The dish brought an ideal combination of sweet-savory flavors and textures.
