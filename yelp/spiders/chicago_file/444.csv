Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Great place for breakfast. Â Had the espanol omelette. Pretty good and huge portion. Tried the wife's florentine benny. It was delicious. Split an order of the signature berry bliss pancake. Probably the best pancakes I've ever had. Juice was fresh squeezed and everything was reasonably priced.
