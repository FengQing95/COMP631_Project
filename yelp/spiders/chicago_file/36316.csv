Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The Service:  Aside from a truly rude male hostess who seemed to love his role as gatekeeper the team of servers at Bavette's couldn't have been better.  From the guys at the bar chatting up the clientele to the runners who wiped down our table after every course and refilled water glasses with a near-invisible hand everything was smooth.
