Little Goat Diner////All in all, would be a nice place to go if you could just walk in and get a drink and dinner or if you had a hangover and wanted pancakes (then again, I don't know anybody who likes to wait in that condition). Not worth making a reservation or going all the way down there just for their food. If you are in the neighborhood try it out, but don't plan around it.
