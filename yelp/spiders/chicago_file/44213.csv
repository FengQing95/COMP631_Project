Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The mango sangria was outstanding! It was not too sweet and went down really easy (probably too easy!). We absolutely loved the mashed potatoes that came with the short rib, and the beef skewer with horseradish was cooked perfectly and was really tasty - this says a lot since I don't like red meat too much. We also ate every bit of the dates wrapped in bacon and the patatas bravas - these were also standout dishes among the ones we tried.
