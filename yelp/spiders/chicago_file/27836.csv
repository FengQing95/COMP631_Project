Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When in Chicago a deep dish pizza is a must! Lous Malnati's was recommended to me by my Chicago- native friends. This is the type of deep dish pizza that has so much cheese it's amazing! Apparently this is also where the locals go to (I definitely got that vibe) because there were no sign of tourists. I ordered the gluten free crust with tomato sauce and for a place that doesn't specialize in vegan/ non dairy this was honestly super good! I was very surprised when I finished the whole pizza pie by myself. We also got the malnati salad and it was delicious!I highly recommend this place
