Little Goat Diner////I absolutely love this restaurant- it's a new staple for when I visit Chicago. The menu is delicious, and the waitstaff are knowledgeable and helpful with the menu. We ordered the fish tostadas and the Reuben- both were absolutely delicious. The Reuben was piled high and packed with flavor- the fish tostadas were also GIANT and super filling. We ordered the Mac n cheese as a side, and I'll be honest... I'd fly back to that restaurant for the Mac n cheese any freakin day of the week. It was so delicious and creamy, topped with crunch breadcrumbs. So. Good! For dessert we opted for the ice cream sundaes the restaurant made in these adorable old fashioned diner glasses (makes sense, of course) and they were huge. The only frustrating part is that we couldn't really customize our sundae- or add any extra ingredients... so that part was a bummer. Overall, I highly recommend this place, hands down. We had a blast.
