Little Goat Diner////This place is ok, and maybe I just had my expectations set too high due to all the hype, but our party left a little disappointed. Some of the things we ordered were better than others, we really enjoyed the tempura mashed potatoes, but the corn was pretty salty. Two people at our table order the skirt stake medium rare, and both had it brought to them well done. I had the Goat Almighty burger, and aside from it being an impressively large burger, it wasn't the best burger I've ever had. Salty, but lacking much other flavor.
