Smoque BBQ////Smoque popped my BBQ cherry.  I had had a little experience with BBQ before Smoque, but I'm offically a BBQ brat now.  I mean if this is your first REAL BBQ experience, what the hell can POSSIBLY stand up to it?  The brisket is so good, I'm literally drooling thinking about it.  The staff here is great too.  One of my first times here we were asked to move for a larger party, and gladly did so.  One of the staff gave us free food (Sausage, that was pretty damn good though I'd never order it with the brisket on the menu!) for being so courteous!  A++!  You really don't find good service around very much any more, but Smoque delivers on ALL fronts.  Come hungry, leave happy.
