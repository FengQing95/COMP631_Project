Little Goat Diner////I finally made it to Stephanie Izard's second restaurant and I was so excited despite the weather being ridiculously gloomy. As soon as we were seated, the lady next to us was talking about how delicious her white fish tostadas were, so I decided to order that! The fish tostadas included crisp whitefish, with a shallot aioli, a chickpea and onion salad and that was all topped with harissa vinaigrette. I also ordered a side of tempura mashed potatoes which is mashed potatoes that is tempura fried and then served with asian bbq and ranch sauce. The tostadas were delicious although I am just not a huge fan of chickpeas. The aioli really added a lot of flavor to the dish and the tostada shell and fish were fried to perfect. The tempura mashed potatoes were also really good, although I enjoyed them more the day afterwards since I was so full from the tostadas.
