Little Goat Diner////My boyfriend and I decided last minute on a Saturday we wanted to go out for brunch which can be quite the feat in Chicago without a long wait. We ended up at Little Goat because we'd heard good things about it but also because they had same day reservations available. When we made the reservation it said we may have to sit at the counter, which we were fine with, but ended up getting a table outside. Score!
