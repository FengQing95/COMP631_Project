Little Goat Diner////Ok, so I come here incredibly infrequently due to underwhelming experiences but this last visit was pretty good.  The Banh mi style burger is good.  It is pretty hard to eat as the patti falls apart as you eat it.  Overall, it's not really a Banh mi sandwich, but if you like vinegar, you'll like this.
