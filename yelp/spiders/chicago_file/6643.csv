The Purple Pig////I would like to rate higher. The quality and taste is excellent for every dish. The one caveat my table noticed was after a few bites of each dish you start to realize the food is a bit too salty and rich when trying to finish the entire dish. We ended up needing to keep refilling our waters and wish there was bread or something on the side.
