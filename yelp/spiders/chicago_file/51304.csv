Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We had stuffed mushrooms, stuffed dates, piri piri fried chicken, the short rib, and garlic shrimp.  Every dish was delicious but I think the short rib and garlic shrimp are standouts.  The shrimp was so garlicy and the sauce was a perfect dip for the house bread.  The stuffed dates were an awesome sweet and salty unctuous umami bomb.  The short rib was so tender and fatty with beautiful potato purée and really tasty caramelized roasted root vegetables.  The mushrooms were tasty and satisfying, could use some crispness of panko for texture.
