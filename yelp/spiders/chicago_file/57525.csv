Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////However, they charge prices that I would expect not to be rushed out once we ask for the bill. They cleaned the table while we were waiting for the check, very invasively so, like reaching into our personal space. Then, the waitress could not give me 2 more mins for me to look up my lettuce eats number!
