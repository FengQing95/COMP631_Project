Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My second time at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba and I enjoyed it just as much as the first. A quick note, my first visit was during a second date after many other ventures (including beverages), and I returned this week with that same person for an early Valentine's Day. We both had Lettuce Entertain You gift cards and even after all of the delicious food we consumed, we had money to spare! The value in the product here is so incredible. Every dish is served with perfect timing, as tapas should be, and in a beautiful order that creates a want for more. Gabriel was our server this time around and he gave us a wonderful experience. He was just attentive enough but never bothersome and treated us to a little something extra at the end of our dining. I would 100% recommend Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba to anyone looking for awesome food and a great ambiance. Don't get turned off by the lack of reservation times, there's always room for more :)
