Smoque BBQ////Other than the small amount of seating this place is awesome! The baby back ribs are the best I've ever had. The pulled pork also the best. Good atmosphere and friendly staff. Well worth the money you'll drop here. But you'll save bringing in your own liquor! Â Highly recommended! Will definitely be going back!
