Little Goat Diner////First off, the place is SO ADORABLE.  I love the decor and their concept of a trendy diner.  The waitstaff was incredibly friendly and helpful and though we had to wait a while for a table, we didn't mind.  We got there at 10:00am and there was already a 45 minute wait!  We went to the quick shop attached to it where we had said Kimchi cream cheese bagel and I could have been happy if we left it at that.
