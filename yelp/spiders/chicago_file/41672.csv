Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Fantastic food and great service! I recently held a dinner here for 7 friends, and Caf√©-Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint. Our waitress advised us to order about two tapas per person, which ended up being the perfect amount. We each ordered something and passed it around so we all got a bite. Some of our group had never done tapas before and loved the variety of dishes everyone gets a chance to try. And don't leave with out trying the sangria, very good! I would definitely recommend as a fun option for groups.
