Little Goat Diner////Breakfast, lunch and dinner served all day with an absurdly eclectic menu with "Cereal Killers" (off the beat breakfast like Breakfast Spaghetti 'N Clams 'N Crab and Crumpets with chorizo maple syrup), Sandwiches, buggers, a section dedicated to taters (potatos) and dinner items with asian influences like Kalbi Beef ribs and Veggie Chap Chae.  It is a bit hard to figure out what to get since everything sounds so good.  Most everything we tried was good but more importantly memorable.
