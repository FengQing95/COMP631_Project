Little Goat Diner////For breakfast, I got This Little Piggy Went to China which is a dish made up of sesame cheddar biscuit, szechuan pork sausage (more of a patty than sausage IMO), sunny side up eggs, and a chili garlic sauce. The dish is as good as it sounds. I just love how Little Goat Diner takes your standard, popular American breakfast items and make it a completely different yet cohesive dish by interweaving Asian flavors. All my friends were satisfied with their dishes as well. Another restaurant where I don't think you can go wrong. Best part is that the prices are competitive with other brunch places, so you don't have to worry about putting a dent in your wallet.
