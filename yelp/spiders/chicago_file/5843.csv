The Purple Pig////On the Mag Mile, some consider The Purple Pig a "tourist trap", I think of it as a "tourist hot spot". Unfortunately, as a result of how busy they are, they don't take reservations, so expect to wait for a table. I got to the restaurant at around 5:45pm on a Thursday night and was lucky enough to get the last two seats at the bar, but from when I was there till when I left at 8:30pm, there were people waiting for both floor tables and bar seats.
