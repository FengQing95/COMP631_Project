Art Institute of Chicago////It's right next to the beautiful parks in the downtown area of Chicago.  After checking out some of the other sights in the city, I decided to check out the art.  I'm glad I went.  There's a dense, but varied collection in here with many floors to see.  I got to see Van Gogh and Monet.  The works of these two are some of my favorites so to see them up close was spectacularly awesome! I really enjoyed my time in the museum and being so big I got to really burn calories from my big lunch (see my review for Portillo's and you'll know why).  Staff was great, it was a great experience.  A great treasure in the city!
