Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Whilst in Chicago I wanted to check out an authentic Chicago pizzeria. I'm staying at the Acme Hotel on East Ohio, so I asked the reception and they recommended Lou's. The 10 minute was was pleasant and easy. When I arrived I was greeted with a smile and offered a seat at the bar - perfect for when dining out alone. The bar tender was friendly and took time to talk to everyone at the bar. The 'Original' was the pizza I ordered and it was delicious. The butter crust made the whole thing.
