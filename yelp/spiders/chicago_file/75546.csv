Little Goat Diner////Sister number 2 got the omelette of the day which was ham and cheese. This was the best looking ham and cheese omelette I had ever seen. The thing was huge, had a variety of delicious cheeses and the ham was well prepared. I wish I would've ordered this, but don't regret my patty melt at all.
