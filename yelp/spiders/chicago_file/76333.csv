Little Goat Diner////I was overwhelmed by their food choices, so I decided to ask the waitress her top choices. My eyes kept glancing at their apple granola pancakes (and I'm salivating just thinking about it) I was happy to hear that was her top choice, and my god, it was the best pancakes I've ever had. Â I don't even know where to begin -- the crunchy tasty granola on top...the fluffy thick pancakes, the syrup...man, it was that good and I will get it again when I come back.
