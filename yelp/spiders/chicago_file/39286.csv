Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As far as the side, the truffle mac n cheese was the BEST I've ever had. It had the perfect blend of cheeses - gooey and creamy in texture and a faint smoky flavor to it. The small cubes of bacon gave it that extra edge. The dish was broiled perfectly prior to serving for texture which gave it a nice appeal.
