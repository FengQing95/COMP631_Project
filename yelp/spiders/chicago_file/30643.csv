Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First experience with authentic deep dish pizza and it was good. Buttery crust, lots of Â gooey cheese and toppings make a good pizza. The place had a real old school look to it. Place was busy though, so be prepared to wait for a table. You can preorder tour food at the register while waiting for a table. Definitely expedites the process. But the pizza is worth the wait.
