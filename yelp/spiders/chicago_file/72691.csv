Little Goat Diner////When my gf and I got seated we ordered the lump crab cheesy dip with Ritz crackers and ate it quickly. They happily gave us a ritz cracker refill. I ordered the pork shoulder pancake with a side of mac n' cheese and my gf got the trout. Mine was excellent! The pork belly was very savory and salty (good thing) and my mac n' cheese was creamy, gooey, and super cheesy.
