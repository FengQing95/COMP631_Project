Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////First off, I'll admit I've never been a fan. Meaning just I've been before and not really cared for the establishment. There is just something about the service, decor, drinks and especially the food that rubs me the wrong way. But foolishly I came in thinking maybe this time will be different... flash forward... I had to take a day off from work due to severe stomach cramps among other happenings that I won't divulge. Some THING didn't agree with me to say the least. That thing was paella!! I generally eat pretty healthy so certain greasy foods just don't agree with me but it's never been this bad. So it could be one part me, two parts nasty paella.
