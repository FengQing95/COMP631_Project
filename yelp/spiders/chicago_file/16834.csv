Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The staff were kind, Â but disorganized. After minutes someone brought a pizza to our table which was not ours. We told the server and he seemed irritated at us. When our pizza finally came out, it was wrong because of server gave our pizza to another table. They quickly made us a personal size of what we were supposed to get on half of ours. No compensation or apology was offered for the numerous mistakes. Good pizza, good calamari.
