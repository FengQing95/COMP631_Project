Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Lives up to the hype!  Of course the seafood tower, steaks and side dishes are amazing. Ambiance is gorgeous - dark and cozy. Specialty cocktails delicious. Service was impeccable.  But what am I dreaming about the day after our visit?  The salad!  The server put it in the middle of our table and the smell of fresh herbs filled the air.  We all shared it but that won't be happening next time. I want my own all to myself! My new favorite restaurant in the city! (And favorite salad of all time)
