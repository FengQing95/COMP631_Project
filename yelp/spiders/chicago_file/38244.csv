Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I really enjoyed my meal and the service at Bavette's, but I gave it only 3 stars for a few reasons. First, I had really high expectations from what I've heard about the restaurant, and though it was good, it wasn't the best I've had in Chicago. Also, when I made reservations weeks in advance, I could only get in at 10:45. When we got there around 10, half the place was empty. We realized we could have gone much earlier and got a seat. Third, everyone around us seemed to have bread right away (which we were begging for because by 10:45, we were starving). We had to ask our waitress, but we figured it should have been brought right away.
