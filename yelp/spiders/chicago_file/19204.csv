Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ended up cheating the system on the second day and while we were waiting in line for Doughnut Vault (best donut I've ever had in my life), I discovered there was a Lou Malnati's down the street. So I ordered a small personal sized pizza to go. It worked out perfectly because as soon as we finished the amazing doughyness, we walked over and I snacked on my pizza. The personal size was $7.33 with tax.
