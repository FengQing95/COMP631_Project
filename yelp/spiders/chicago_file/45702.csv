Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I wasnt impressed but they were good enough to receive the lowest four possible....The half pitcher of sangria was good not phenom.  The tapas dishes (salmon and other was scallops)  both were again decent but just didnt give me the wow factor!  One thing I didnt care for were both dishes were served/dressed w/ the same bail pesto oil.  Yeah I understand restaurants need to be universal w/ some of their ingredients, it just happened to be the two dishes I ordered had the same accent flavors.  Always my luck, so im used to it.  ;)  Also the service was very nice and always asking if needed anything else.
