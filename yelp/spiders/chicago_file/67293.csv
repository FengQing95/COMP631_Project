Little Goat Diner////Please everyone, relax with the groupie 4-star ratings.  I dropped in here because someone told me to check out the Diner and the bread/coffee/shakes were good so I said why not?  Went with a dude friend of mine and he was visiting from the burbs, and well...let's be honest, the location is great and the venue does have a cool feel to it.  But I understood completely the wait...1 hour, whatever...no big deal.  While we waited, I checked out the Coffee area and beginning with the Coffee selection, umm...coffee from Seattle?  No thanks.  I have enough local roasters to spend $15 bucks for a 1/2 lb of coffee.  No thanks.  As for the bakery products, tried a couple of bread items while we waited for our seat.  I give this a 4 star....I admit the bread is legitimate but overall, nothing much to cry about to visit this place for coffee/bread.  I had a cup of latte, and it tasted a bit like Caribou like....again, not only is it well above the price-mark of a moderate priced coffee shop, the espresso in my latte wasn't anything that blew me away.  And why are they selling soaps and shit?  It's a bit weird man to buy toiletry shit at a place that sells bread and coffee.  Fine...sell it, but maybe I'm just a prick for calling you guys out on this.  As for the people who seat you, need to get some communication classes going man...not much to talk to them about, they think they are in New York at some high-end restaurant...relax girl, it's just a diner....not some fancy french joint.  Food?  Well...after finally getting seated...picked a couple of things - Salty...Salty...Salty.  Only thing that I liked were the fries, but $5 bucks for a handful of fries is a bit crazy, think i will stick w/ five guys.  As for your shakes...well, i tried the chocolate malt and it didnt taste any different than Steak N' Shake.  So $6 something for a mediocre shake was not worth it.  Needless to say, not planning to hitting this joint anytime soon again...I'm sure these guys will do well, people love waiting for their table...in a cool trendy location/venue....with lots of hipsters serving you food and stuff.  Also, I will make sure to tell Bed, Bath & Beyond customers to hit your location up for some soap.
