Little Goat Diner////I visited Little Goat for breakfast with the law school girls wanting to love it. And there's enough there to give it a second date but not love at first sight. The kimchi egg bacon pancake asian breakfast just didn't work for me. Hubby validated my opinion from the leftovers I brought home. Now my friend's crispy chicken french toast was amazing and she cleaned her plate. My other friend ... not so much with her brandade benedict, which was heavy on heavy but still better than my kimchi dish.
