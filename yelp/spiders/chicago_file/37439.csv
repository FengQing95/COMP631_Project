Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The oysters were good, crisp and fresh. If you like Kumamotos, of course you'll like these. The bone marrow was AMAZING and was a big hit with everyone! The foie gras was good but not the consistency my husband likes. The t-bone lamb chop was GOOD and cooked to perfection!!! Melt in your mouth good!! And the steak frittes + ribeye were equally as tasteful. You can't go wrong with anything you order here because EVERYTHING was good, like really good!! I'm salivating now.....
