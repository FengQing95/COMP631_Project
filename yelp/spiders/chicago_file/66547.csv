Little Goat Diner////So glad to have LG in the neighborhood. I will be back many times. My husband and I went with out out of town guests on New Years Day. Despite the wait, the service was great and I loved the set up and decor. More importantly all the food was a flavor explosion in my mouth. Glad we came with friends so we could share a bunch of dishes. I don't normally order breakfast burritos, but I decided to and I am glad I did. I have been thinking about it since I ate it. The flavor and texture combination was brilliant. My husband loved his eggs benedict. The biscuits were so light and flaky and the chicken gravy was good. The Elvis Pancakes were good but I probably wouldn't order them again. My friend didn't like the coffee. All in all great place and can't wait to have many more meals at LG and LG Bread!
