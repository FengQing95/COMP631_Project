Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////SERVICE: The service was incredible - my water glass was never empty! Our server was very respectful and came by frequently enough that we felt attended to, but not so much that it was overbearing. Our drinks and food all came out at perfect intervals as well. The only downside is that they seem to only have two single person restrooms for the entire restaurant and there was an extremely long wait.
