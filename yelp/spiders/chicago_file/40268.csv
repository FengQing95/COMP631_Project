Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We did not have a reservation and Bavette's but they seated us right away in the bar area. Shiza was our waitress. She recommended a couple things on the menu and we split them. I ordered a dirty Martini with hand stuffed blue cheese olives; which was excellent and my friend did an old fashion which was great.
