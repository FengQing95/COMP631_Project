Little Goat Diner////It's a diner, it's not fancy Girl & the Goat from across the street - my wife's, er I mean, Stephanie's higher end venture. So get over your snobby self and tuck in for some way the hell above average diner food, food. My table ordered the Bull's eye french toast (think fancy fried chicken and waffles), the pork belly pancake (think Asian fusion taco), the shrimp sandwich on fresh baked bread from the connected bakery (think mouth-gasm) and for the table we split the smoked pork and toffee crunch milkshake - that's right, I said it, smoked pork in ice cream. When the waitress asked if we wanted a shot of bourbon in it, the table answered in unison by saying, "duh." :) It's rich, very rich - it took 3 of us to work our way through it, but after each first sip (and until a pork chunk got stuck in the straw) we offered a moment of silence. It's blow your mind good. All of it, everything we ate was blow your mind good. It is hands down the best food I have had in Chicago so far.
