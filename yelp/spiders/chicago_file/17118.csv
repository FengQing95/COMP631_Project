Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The only reason I give this pizzeria 2 stars is the appetizer and pizza were quite good. This being said, we looked forward to ordering dessert. However, after dropping off the appetizer, our server, Gloria, never came back, not even to check for refills (we wanted more wine). After we waited a half an hour with empty glasses and plates, I finally flagged Gloria down. At that point, we still planned on more drinks and desserts. However, Gloria was rude and dismissive, losing money for the business and herself.
