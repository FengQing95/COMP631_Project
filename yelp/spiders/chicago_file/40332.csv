Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The Best Steakhouse in Chicago. My boyfriend and I split the Porterhouse and it was the best of both worlds: a filet and a bone in steak. I don't know what's in the mushrooms, but they almost tasted like Carmel, could probably eat a bowl of those to myself. Mac and cheese was also phenomenal with a bit of truffle, but not too overpowering. The ambiance is great: romantic, not too crowded, and a comfortable cute bar.  The champagne cocktail was my favorite: a little bubbly, but not too strong.  I say this steakhouse is the best because of the crisp crust on the steak: I don't think the other steakhouses quite master it like Bavette's. Obsessed with this place and already thinking about our next trip back!
