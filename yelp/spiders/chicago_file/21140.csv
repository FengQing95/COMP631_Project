Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My family moved from Roselle to Buffalo Grove in 1976 and one night my mom asked me if I wanted to join them for pizza and I asked her if we could go to John's.  She told me that we were going to try a new place that their friends had recommended to them.  I asked where and when told Lou Malnati's my first thought was "what the heck is a Lou Malnati's"?
