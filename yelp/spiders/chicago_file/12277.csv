Art Institute of Chicago////Being a child of the 80's this place has a special place in my heart... it was featured in that timeless John Hughes film of "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" the Museum scene of Cameron, Sloan and Ferris ditch day, while "Please, Please, Please let me get what I want" instrumental of the Smith's tune plays beautifully in the background.
