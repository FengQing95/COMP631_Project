Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////-Iberico Ham Hash: I shamelessly have a serious love for canned corned beef hash and this dish is the luxe, pimped up version of a childhood favorite.  The poached egg soaks into all the crispy bits of ham and potato and oh my word that HAM.  Iberico Jamon is generally regarded as the best ham in the world so yeah, it's DECADENT.
