Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I had a chance to eat at Lou Malnati's when I was traveling to Chicago. Overall I liked the pizza. I didn't get the "wow" factor on first bite, but I appreciated more after having several more bites. The sauce is not too tangy, the crust was buttery and cheese and sausages were generously spread over the pizza. Would recommend to anyone visiting Chicago.
