Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cleaning off my coffee table for the first time in months (that's what watching a marathon of "Hoarders" will do to you), I came across a gift certificate that was earned by attending the New Years Day Pajama Brunch at Ba-Ba-Reeba. Since it was expiring in November, I figured it was time to get off my duff and use it, and since I don't love sitting inside here and it was warm last night, my s.o and I made our way there to enjoy some tapas and sangria on their outdoor patio.
