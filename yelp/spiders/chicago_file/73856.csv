Little Goat Diner////We arrived and were offered the ability to either sit at a communal table or wait 10-15min for a 'real' table.  We elected to wait.  What's nice is that (after figuring out the confusing ordering system), is that you can go into the coffee shop/bakery/bar next door and order a beverage of your liking.  I elected a skim latte which (as other reviews have already stated) came with a heart on top.  That does make the high price tag more palatable, but honestly, I think it's about the same price as a latte at Starbucks and this one was way better.
