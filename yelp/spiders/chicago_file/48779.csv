Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great place for tapas! I had the goat cheese and tomato sauce dip and the patatas braves and both were delicious. The service could use a LOT of work. We kept having to look for the waiter and wave him down - it was a little annoying because we didn't want to have to do that, but he would not come by us and we had no choice. The food is great though and I don't want to fully rate a place on bad service. Check it out!
