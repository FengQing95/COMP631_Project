Little Goat Diner////This place was incredibly popular - I came in around 11:30am on a Saturday and had a SOLID one hour wait. I was getting hungry so went over to the bakery section and got a muffin and tea, which was very helpful, as I was starting to get "hangry" (so hungry that you start to get angry). Â The bakery area is a very nice touch.
