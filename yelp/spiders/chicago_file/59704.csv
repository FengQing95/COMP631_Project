Smoque BBQ////After waiting an hour in line and finally getting our food, my family could not find a place to sit - even though we were asked if were dining in.  So as a last resort, we made our order to-go and drove back to my apartment in Edgewater.  We were surprised on how well the food held up, but I'm sure it could have been better if we have eaten there. Two thumbs up for bad-ass to-go containers!
