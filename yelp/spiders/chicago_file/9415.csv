Art Institute of Chicago////My niece and I were here on MLK day until our feet gave out.  This museum holds many wonderful memories for me.  Where I was first introduced to art and fell in love with impressionist paintings.  Lucky for us that the Art Institute has a great collection and a wide range from textiles, photography, paintings, the miniature rooms, and the education wing for children.
