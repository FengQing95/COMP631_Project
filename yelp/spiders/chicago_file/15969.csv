Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Amazing pizza. The best Chicago deep dish pizza that I have had to date. The bread is flaky and rich in flavor. The tomato sauce is perfectly balanced. Since I live in LA, I order the pizzas online. It is fairly priced and arrives quickly. The sausage pizza is delicious. You will not be disappointed.
