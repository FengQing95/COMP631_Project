Art Institute of Chicago////There were many rooms and 3 floors. We initially took our time but noticed the time and had to go to dinner, so we started scanning through each room and couldn't read everything. The art work in here is cool- they had a Van Gogh room...we aren't art-loving people (but we enjoy seeing it) so we weren't sure if the paintings in there were the real deal because there's a Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam...do they share or something? Also the sculptures in the Asia exhibit were awesome...again we questioned the authenticity of it but asked a staff and she confirmed everything here is original and that just blew our minds!!! Crazy how well they are able to preserve it. We are glad we asked and came to see actual art!
