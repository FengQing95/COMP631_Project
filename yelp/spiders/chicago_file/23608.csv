Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The Chicago Classic had to be one of the best pizzas I have ever had , EVER. What made it unique was the the sausage was a giant patty, not crumbles like you are used to. This gives you a bite of sausage with every bite. The sauce and cheese they use was very good but what sent this pizza over the edge was def the crust. It was so buttery and flaky yet not heavy. The Lou we got since we felt like we needed some veggies. This pizza was ok, I preferred the Veggie pizza at Giordano's but the Lou was still good nonetheless.
