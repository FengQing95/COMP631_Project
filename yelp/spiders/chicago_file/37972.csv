Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////When the only possibly complaint I have is that other people found it too dark too read the menu and had to use their phone lights to see....I think it's safe to say this place is as good as it gets. Â I had no expectations going into Bavette's -- some friends had placed the reservation, I had never heard of it, and since I rarely spend time in this area and this was just not really on my radar.
