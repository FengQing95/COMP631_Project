Little Goat Diner////The manager did ask me how was my meal and I blurted out that it was so good that I wanted to rewrite my will and have my ashes sprinkled here. Ha! It's now really funny to me considering that whole "disrupted peacefulness thing" was the way that began this review.  Maybe I will find peace.  Maybe I'll have an everlasting cheese "to go." I hope you can take it with you.
