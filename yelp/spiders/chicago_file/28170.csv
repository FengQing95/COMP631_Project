Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So this is pretty touisty, but good.  We got the "Butter Thin Crust" which my mate suggested and it was very good.  I would say that I would have done the traditional deep dish next time but overall it had nice cheese, good sauce and a nice crust.  I stil would say I like NYC thin crust better.
