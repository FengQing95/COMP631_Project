Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I'm going to have to rock the boat on this one and disagree with just about everyone else to give you my honest feedback about Bavette's. First of all, I think it's disrespectful to your customers to open a restaurant in such a small space that you can only accommodate a handful of people each night. You can't call yourself a restaurant, you should call yourself a bar with option to eat. It's just a ploy to create hype for your restaurant, surely, you could have leased a space that would give you ample room for enough tables and chairs to let an average number of diners come there each night. Second, your hostesses are the rudest people I've come across and those are the first impressions on your customers.
