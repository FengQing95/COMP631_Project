Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time in Chicago means you must try deep dish. My friend and I waited about 30 minutes after getting their early around 5pm. I like that they have a wait time app to see where you are in line. You place and order at the front if you want to get deep dish and all the other appetizers when you sit down. When we got our table, our deep dish still took a while as if we hadn't placed it earlier. We were waiting for some time. The pizza itself was pretty good. Use your hands and bite into it so you can get the experience of eating deep dish instead of using a knife and fork. I still prefer NY thin crust pizza, but definitely fun to eat and experience.
