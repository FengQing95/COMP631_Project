Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Its a solid place but not worth the hype (and difficulty securing reservations). Steak came out similar to what I can do on my gas grill. The long dry aging process was nice and the fries were tasty. . . but the garlic shrimp was so so and the corn with lime was a soupy mess and not nearly worth it. Wine was good but overpriced.
