Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is delicious!  very good tapas, fun atmosphere and pretty good drinks.  Only issue was that with a big group they couldn't really figure out who ordered what and where so we were playing lots of musical plates.  It was a huge group and was busy enough i could empathize with the confusion but they had to have dealt with this issue before sigh...  Great food wonderful everything else Salud!
