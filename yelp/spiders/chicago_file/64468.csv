Smoque BBQ////I ordered a full rack of Baby Back ribs and almost all of the savory sides; corn bread, mac and cheese, coleslaw, brisket chili, and french fries. The ribs were very good and just the right consistency--delicate enough to melt in your mouth as you pull away from the bone. They serve the meat dry and give you ample sauce on the side to wet them to your liking; However, I liked the seasoning they used on the bark so much that I didn't dare touch my sauce. I liked the sides in this order: French fries (quality AND quantity, these bad boys have their own special seasoning), mac and cheese (full of cheesy-flavor with bread crumbs sprinkled on top), corn bread (chunks of corn inside but too small a helping to have adequate softness/moisture retention), coleslaw (just okay, the oil & vinegar kind), brisket chili (too watery, bleh).
