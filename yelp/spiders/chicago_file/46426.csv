Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////To my surprise, this place still packs 'em in, despite tapas being rather passé. This was one of the first (if not the first) tapas places in the city (not sure if Café Iberico holds that distinction) and it's still going strong, so people obviously still go crazy for tapas. I can take 'em or leave 'em.
