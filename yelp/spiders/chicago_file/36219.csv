Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The baked goat cheese with herbs is heavenly. I wanted to jump in an swim in it, it was sooo good! The decor is really nice and romantic too, if you're looking for a great romantic date spot, this is the place. Drinks are also quite good, with a nice selection of beers, though nothing on tap, but that's ok. Try the malted whiskey ice cream and the garlic shrimp, they'll make you want to slap yourself!
