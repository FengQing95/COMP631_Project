Art Institute of Chicago////As I have gotten older, I still have a penchant for the Thorne Rooms, but I also adore their curated exhibits and permanent collections.  My true favorite now, though, is that the Art Institute is a veritable melting pot.  It is a destination for locals and tourists alike which means that with every turn of the head you can hear different languages and spy different cultures.  That alone is worth the price of admission.
