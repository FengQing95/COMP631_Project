Little Goat Diner////I love the fried pickles and onion rings (and sauces that come with), tempura mashed potatoes, chocolate chip pancakes, fattoush salad, pork belly home fries, mac and cheese, and fish tostadas -- you really can't go wrong here. I've also been with a bigger group (I think 10-12ish people?) and they were super accommodating of people arriving at different times and splitting the bill 4 or 5 ways.
