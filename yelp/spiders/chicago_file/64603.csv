Smoque BBQ////My friend and I decided to take a spontaneous trip to Smoque BBQ which has been on our list since we moved here. On a late Friday night around 9, we walked in to a busy, homey joint eager for barbecue. We scanned the menu and walked straight to the counter to order. I got 1/4 rack of St. Louis ribs with cole slaw and Mac n cheese (felt like the perfect portion to me) and she got a 1/3 rack of Baby Back ribs with fries and Mac n cheese (hers came with cole slaw).
