Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Went for dinner and drinks with some friends and had a superb time. The atmosphere is warm and dark, with a speakeasy vibe. We had reservations so no wait time. All of the drinks we had were expertly made, strong, and sublime. One of the best old fashioneds I've had! I also had a sazerac, which was delicious, and the death in the afternoon, which was OK - needed more absinthe. Our waiter Eric was beyond on point and was attentive, funny, and knowledgeable. They had a chicken pot pie on special and he saved us the last one until we were ready to order. The pot pie was amazing! The crust was so buttery, crispy, perfectly golden brown, and just addicting. The surrounding mashed potatoes were creamy and garlicky, and the interior was hot and luscious, with a steam to take you back to childhood rushing forth - and flavor off the chain. We also tried to trout Caesar salad, which was dressed nicely and was super yummy and refreshing. The fries were also divine and perfect. Finally we had a steak, which was perfectly cooked and had a succulent flavor. The dinner lasted a long time and was well worth it. I loved being there and cannot wait to go back and try more dishes. A must go.
