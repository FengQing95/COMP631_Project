Little Goat Diner////Good food. I had some french toast with egg inside of it. Definitely one of the more unique things I've ever eaten. Food's a bit pricey and it was super crowded when it first opened (seems to still be pretty crowded around lunch time), but I'd go there again. Seating is plentiful and the food actually is really good.
