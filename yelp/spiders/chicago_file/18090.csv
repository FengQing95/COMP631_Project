Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have eaten deep dish pizza maybe twice in my life before and wasn't crazy about it. I like pizza, but I don't love it. Â Despite all that , this was the most amazing deep dish pizza I have ever eaten. Buttery crisp crust that held up to the massive filling of fresh cheese, tomatoes and sausage. The salads ( the Malnati and the Caesar ) were very fresh and tasty, though I wish we hadn't wasted the stomach space so I could have had more pizza, I barely was able to finish one slice. We sat at the bar, and the service was prompt and friendly and my martini was perfectly prepared. It was a madhouse in there on a Saturday night, packed on both floors with a line out the door, but we got there fairly early and ordered ahead of time, even before we were seated and ended up snagging seats at the bar where we stayed.
