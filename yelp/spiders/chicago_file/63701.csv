Smoque BBQ////I was very UNIMPRESSED with Smoque. I love Texas brisket BBQ, and this is no where close. The bark on the brisket was excellent, but beyond that, it was a total let down. I lived in central Texas; that's where I learned to love great BBQ. Now I'm in the Midwest, so whenever I travel, I'm always looking for the above average BBQ. Smoque is not above average, despite the soaring reviews. The first tip off should have been the smell - or lack thereof. Doesn't smell like smoke or wood outside the restaurant or even inside it. I got a pound of sliced brisket and a large mac-n-cheese. Beware, a "large" mac-n-cheese is 2 very small little containers. The sweet tea is pre-made syrup; they can't even brew sweet tea. I give 2 stars because of the good bark and because Chicago is so lacking in great Texas-style brisket that this is ok. I will never go back to Smoque.
