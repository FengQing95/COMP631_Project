Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!//// The only reason I would not give this place 5 stars would be the service. The first time I went, we waited a very long time after being seated even to be greeted and have our drink orders taken. By this time we were ready to order everything already. We did have to grab a different server at one point because we didn't see ours much at all. It was not too busy at this time, either. The second time was early, around 10am when they opened. The service was prompt, but we had a different issue. I understand when the restaurant first opens there are not many tables to attend so the servers stand around, but we felt down-right uncomfortable eating because we were being watched by different servers who were not busy. It was hard to relax and enjoy the food when we could see them just standing there watching us. Quite uncomfortable. This is more a note to the business, just something to keep in mind. Other than those two issues, I love coming here. The prices are fair and the food is excellent.
