Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The portion was big enough to share with 3 people. I was so full after the appetizer that barely had any room for the main star, the deep dish pizza. The Malnati Chicago Classic had a crunchy crust but the sausage patty tasted alright. It was a huge thick sausage patty which lacked some flavor.
