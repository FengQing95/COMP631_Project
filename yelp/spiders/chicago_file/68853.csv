Little Goat Diner////Quality and consistency of reviews says it all... This place simply rocks.  Had brunch on a weekday and it was packed to the gills.  Supremely enjoyed sidling up to the bar in lieu of waiting an hour and enjoying a meal with chatty personable waitstaff and patrons alike.  Wanted to try the most ingenuous and odd dishes - and Kimchee thing and Onion brioche French toast with fried chicken delivered.  Just make sure you're ready for a food coma... Or leave yourself some time to walk it off.
