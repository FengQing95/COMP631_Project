Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Be prepared for a long wait...but it's worth it. If you're gluten free or keto, note that there is an option to get your favorite pizza toppings on a lean sausage crust (comes with red sauce and mozzarella). It is more filling that you might think--my husband and I shared a medium and had plenty of leftovers, would definitely order a small next time.
