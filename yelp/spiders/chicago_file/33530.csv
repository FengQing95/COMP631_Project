Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food was solid, per usual. Maybe richer and saltier than I remember. We were seated late, maybe 8:20 on an 8pm res. Not too big a deal. I was a big fan of this place, but in my opinion, it's slipped. Took my family from out of town here to impress them and we were all underwhelmed.
