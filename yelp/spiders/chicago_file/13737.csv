Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I am not a fan of pizza, but I love Lou Malnatis. I usually get their thin crust but only because the deep dish is just way to filling for me. I have only had delivery from this location. The pizza is always good. The only bad thing I will say is that the delivery takes a while. Sometimes an hour or more, so order in advance if you are getting delivery.
