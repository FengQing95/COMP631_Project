Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When we came by for lunch it was extremely packed on a Saturday afternoon. The good thing is that you can order your pizza ahead at the counter so that it comes out once you get seated. Just grab a couple beers at the bar and you're set. My party got 2 pizzas here, The Chicago Classic and the Lou.
