Smoque BBQ////But before we get to the awesome food, here were a few notable things - 1) on a weeknight, we walked into a packed restaurant with reasonable wait, to both get a table and our food (~10-15 min).   2) AWESOME SMELLS coming at you from every direction, torturing my starving boyfriend.  3) it's BYOB - don't forget.  4) Their awareness of TX BBQ and Rudy's in general is apparent by the fact that they actually get their sausage from Rudy's - a good sign for things to come!
