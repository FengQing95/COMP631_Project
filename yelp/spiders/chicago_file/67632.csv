Little Goat Diner////since i had already eaten breakfast and it was noon, i had the veggie quesadilla because i honestly couldn't decide on a sandwich. it was THE BEST quesdilla i have ever had! to me, no meat/all veggie options are usually not as fulfilling, but this one was loaded! broccoli, mushrooms, peppers, cheese, more cheese on top, beans, avocado, jalepenos who knows what else.. and the flour tortilla wasn't just your average floppy tortilla, it held its shape and made eating the meal really easy! my fiancee had the bullseye french toast which was an awesome version topped with fried chicken, strawberries, and bbq maple syrup.
