The Purple Pig////The sweet corn was simple and refreshing, but I probably wouldn't order it again. Pork secreto was surprisingly delicious - the meat was lean but tender and super flavorful. The pickled watermelon that came with it was a little overwhelming. The pork belly was cooked well and also very tender. For dessert, we got the fig tart which was paired with espresso mascarpone. It was definitely an interesting flavor combo but wasn't bad! Not too sweet, which I liked.
