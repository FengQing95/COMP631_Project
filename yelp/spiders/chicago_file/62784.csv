Smoque BBQ////ok so Im sorry but I dont really get this place. i didnt like the food, at all. The meat was tender enough, but definitely didnt have the delish smokey flavour that one wants from bbq. The mac and cheese was rather insipid, the best that one can say for it is that it was browned and crispy on top and that made it worth while.
