Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////You cannot go wrong with this deep dish pizza. My opinion of what makes this so good, is that they are not trying to get all 5 star chef on you and add all kinds of ingredients, but they stick to the basics. Firstly, the crust is so wonderful, that if you are a bread person, you can just eat on that by itself.  The cheese is and sauce are so simple, and that is what to me, wakes your mouth up and you begin to wonder, how did you go your whole life not eating this. There is always a wait, but that is to be expected. I personally think it is worth the wait. When we use to drive there after a 9 hour drive, we were always willing to wait, even after we were already tired.  In all of my 12 years of visiting this place, it never disappoints. You can't hold it against them for the wait time, and customer service wise, all I expect is the basics of taking my order and filling my drink at my clean table.
