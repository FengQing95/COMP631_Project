Smoque BBQ////Full disclosure: I'm not an experienced ribs eater in general and therefore have little to compare theirs to. The star of the menu for me is their superbly tender, nicely seared, and mouthwatering brisket, which comes in either sliced or chopped form (don't ask me why, but I prefer sliced). Other protein choices: sausage is terrific, and high marks for the pulled pork and chicken, though I have less experience with those. The sides are mostly very good (mac & cheese, brisket chili, beans are my favorites, and the slaw has a nice light vinegar, not cream, base, perfect in the context of an otherwise heavy meal). Fries are excellent and plentiful, though personally I tend to avoid ordering them to avoid additional damage to the arteries (though I always secretly hope someone else in my party orders them so I can steal a few). Not many dessert choices, but besides cobbler, there's a great bread pudding with pecans and caramel sauce that has a great texture and depth of flavor.
