Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I live close to this place and forget how much I like it. The sangria is solid though not inexpensive. It's hard to go wrong with any of the small plates and I always love the paella. You can pace yourself here and order as much as you like and not feel like you're overdoing it. Brussels sprout salad was really unique. And the Moorish chicken was fabulous. Best empanadas in the hood. And those dates wrapped in bacon are to die for
