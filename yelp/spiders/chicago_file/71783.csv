Little Goat Diner////I saw literally photos of food (or decor) of this place at least one per day for two weeks on my Facebook feed OR instagram.  It became one of restaurants on my list to try out.  Because I am a Korean, their idea of adding Kimchi to some of their food seemed very interesting even though the owner or chef was NOT a korean.
