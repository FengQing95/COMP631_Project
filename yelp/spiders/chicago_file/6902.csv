Art Institute of Chicago////I love the Art Institute.  For me, it's Chicago's best museum, especially now that the Modern Wing has opened.  The museum has an extensive impressionist collection including quite a few spectacular and famous pieces, including a study of straw huts by Monet, several Cezannes, Manets, Reniors, and Van Goghs, etc.  The museum also has a very nice Renaissance collection.  The older biblical exhibits are studded with El Greco.  But by far the best collection (to me) is the modern art from around 1900-1950 (I think).  There are several rooms that chronicle this important era.  Picasso's famed portrait of the old guitar player is prominently on display.  The collection chronicles the founding of cubism with several works by Picasso and Braque, as well as Gris, Kahnweiler, etc.  This museum houses one of the best cubist collections I've seen.  Matisses, Miros, and other important artists of the era area also scattered throughout.
