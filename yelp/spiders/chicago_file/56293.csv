Smoque BBQ////I got the sliced brisket. They put the marbled ones on top so that the first bite is deliccccious. The ones on the bottom only have a layer of fat on top so it's a big tougher on the bottom. Â The sliced brisket gets cold FAST. I sat down and started eating and my second slice was already cold.
