Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We ordered the big boy seafood tower, there were four of us there and it had the right amount of portions to accommodate all of us. The thing that set this tower apart from others I've had is how fresh everything tasted, and the variety of food. It has both East coast and west coast oysters, it came with every consistent you could need, Â the shrimp was huge and amazing just wow wow wow. Next the main course was just as amazing. The table all ordered steak and they were prepared to our liking.
