Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I'd heard so many good things about this place, so I was super excited to try it.  The tapas were insanely delicious, and came out super quickly - the fried chicken, the garlic shrimp, and the scallops empanada were some of my favorites.  A friend recommended the sangria, but it didn't live up the hype - a bit watery and not enough alcohol.  I will definitely come back - this is a great place to go with a group and try a bunch of different things on the extensive menu - but I'll order beer or wine instead.
