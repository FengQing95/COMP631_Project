Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Definitely one of the most difficult places to get reservations. We were a bit disappointed that we still needed to wait about 20 minutes after our reservation time. And because they were very busy, the drinks took a while too. But the food makes it all worth it. Highly recommend the dry aged steaks, which I assume is what most people came here for. Seating situation is a bit tight - you are very close to other tables. They also gave a free mango sorbet for a birthday treat.
