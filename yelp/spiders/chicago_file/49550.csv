Smoque BBQ////This place was awesome!!  After reading all the reviews, we took the kids and had a great meal.  The Mac and Cheese is wonderful, the brisket was great both shredded and sliced.   It was crowded on a Saturday night but only had to wait a few minutes!  Would recommend this place anyday!
