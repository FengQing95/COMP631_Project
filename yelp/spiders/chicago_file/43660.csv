Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////First experience here for myself... my date had been there years ago when they still had a large outdoor seating area.  Went Thursday eve around 8pm... busy of course... young crowd overall and very noisy.  After it all was said and done our 1st word was "Bland" amazingly bland food :(  The best item we had that gave us that savory/sweet burst of flavor was the #67 Roast Dates w/bacon & apple vinaigrette $6.
