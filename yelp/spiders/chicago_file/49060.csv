Smoque BBQ////Everything was perfect!  Smoque was there on-time with their staff....setup was done before guests arrived....and the food was EXCELLENT!!!  I can't believe (well, I can, it's Smoque afterall!) how many people came up to me during and after the wedding to let me know that this was the best food they've ever had at a wedding!  Well done Peggy...and well done Smoque!  Thanks for making our day awesome!!
