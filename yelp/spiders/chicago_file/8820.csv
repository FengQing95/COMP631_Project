Art Institute of Chicago////I took about a week to escape to Chicago during a particularly annoying and stressful time at work.  I've been to Chicago tons of times, but I have never visited Art Institute until this most recent Chicago getaway.  I love art museums, but I'm not the most educated on art theory or history.  I took one humanities class in high school, and that was about it.  Still, I was excited to see some classic works of art like American Gothic and Warhol's Mao.  I also was thrilled to see a lovely Diego Rivera.  But the reason I really loved the place was Marc Chagall's windows.  The cool blues and the ethereal feel helped me calm down and forget the crazy things happening back at home.  It gave me a moment to disconnect with the world, where I could just live in that moment and appreciate the breathtaking beauty around me.  And for that I'm thankful.
