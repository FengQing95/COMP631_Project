Little Goat Diner////I have been following Chef Steph from her Top Chef days and recently on her adventures in Instagram, so when I was at a conference in Chicago, I knew that I needed to do a stop at one of her restaurants. I am an educator on a budget paying my own way from Hawaii and taking care of all my own expenses, so I could not go to her more expensive restaurant but Little Goat is a fun romp with really exceptional food (although a bit salty for my taste). It is definitely family friendly, young people friendly. and as long as you're not trying to have an actual deep discussion, this is a great place for casual dining.
