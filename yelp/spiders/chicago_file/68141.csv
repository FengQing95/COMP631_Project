Little Goat Diner//// !! Cinnamon buns were so delish I was licking my fingers ( no shame ) and we all tried to order different dishes to try as much as we could ! I order a side of bacon wherever I can because it's my favorite thing in the world and this bacon was spot on ! We also tried the porkbelly egg dish , shrimp and grits , burrito , fired chicken and french toast , banana peanut butter waffles , and chocolate pancakes! Everything was scrumptious!! We left brunch with full tummies and great moods ready to take on the cold!
