Little Goat Diner////Overall, it was a satisfying, nutrient-filled breakfast! I liked the fact that the size of our food was perfect, enough to make everyone full and happy. However, I thought the price could be a little lower, since we could probably get a bigger portion had we gone to a different breakfast place. Easy parking was another bonus! Our waitress brought out one bill but was willing to split it accordingly to our preference, so we appreciated the service. Will make it back another time to try the extensive cocktail menu!
