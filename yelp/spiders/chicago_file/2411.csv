The Purple Pig////One of my favorite restaurants in the city! Have come for both lunch to sit at the bar and dinner and both have exceeded expectations. This is a small place where they cook everything on induction burners (fun fact) so it may take a bit to get a table but it's well-worth the wait. Everything is served as small plates so it's meant for sharing but it has a Mediterranean twist (my favorite!). If I had to recommend one thing, it would be the chicken thigh kebabs with fried smashed potatoes and tzatziki. And I know what you're thinking "I eat chicken all the time, why would I get it when I go out" but believe me, it's better than the chicken you eat at home.
