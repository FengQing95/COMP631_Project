Little Goat Diner////Another wonderful restaurant from Stephanie Izard. Just like the Girl & the Goat, a lot of the breakfast menu items incorporate Asian flavors and popular Asian dishes. There's also a bakery attached to the restaurant that offers coffee and baked goods - worth checking out during your wait. I tried the chocolate croissant and the goat latte. The chocolate croissant is surprisingly good - it was nicely flakey and not dense like other croissants you get from coffee shops. The goat latte is not for me though; the goat milk has that prominent 'gaminess' you get from goat cheese that I did not like.
