Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////It's worth the wait (just plan for it), and for $10 you will get enough food to last you for the entire day and half way into tomorrow.  Service is friendly and fun, the atmosphere is casual and vibrant.  The only downside is the ridiculously long wait and inability to make reservations and the lack of a veggie meat option.  Oh and the fact that after I eat at Wildberry, I have to starve myself for 3 days to get back to normal.
