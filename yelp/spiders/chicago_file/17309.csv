Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Tell me if I'm wrong people!  We were in town from Charlotte and had been looking forward to trying pizza in Chicago fresh vs having it shipped dry ice.  We went to Gino's East the day before and it's no contest, Lou Malnati's is so much better.  We only had a ten minute wait so grabbed a drink at the bar first.  We ordered the pepperoni, sausage, cheese and oh my - i'd kill for a fresh slice of it right now.
