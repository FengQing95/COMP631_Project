Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My fiancee and I came to Ba-Ba-Reeba before a show over at the Park West.  I'd normally avoid Lincoln Park like the plague but we wanted to eat somewhere in walking distance of the venue.  The valets were fast and friendly, the host staff and servers/table clearers were quick also.  Everything about the service itself was great!
