Smoque BBQ////I would call this a solid BBQ place. Not the best in Chicago area by any means. Try Steamboat BBQ in Wheaton area, similar quality, better prices. Don't get me wrong, it was a good meal. $35 for 2 adults to eat a BBQ dinner, no drinks, no dessert. MAC and cheese and ribs were not impressive, but good. Brisket was nicely done. Not worth the 20 minutes waiting in line but as first timers we had to wait in order to give it a try. It's byob which is cool. A bit grimey and sticky but I expect a bit of that in a BBQ place. To me this review is to convey a solid experience. But 4 stars would be saying they do it really well; we won't return because there are other places doing it just as well. Maybe 3.5 stars but a little pricey for BBQ.
