Art Institute of Chicago////Best museum in the USA for sure!!!  You can't walk in any direction without seeing some phenomenal works by known and unknown artists.  The vast collection from Monet to Dali to Picasso to Renoir is incredible.  I loved coming across paintings that I was familiar with but never knew who the artist was.
