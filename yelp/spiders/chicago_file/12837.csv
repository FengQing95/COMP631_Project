Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Fabulous.  Finally, our third meal in Chicago and we hit the jackpot!  The drinks were  superb.  We did have an extraordinarily long wait but the server was quick to keep us apprised of the delay. We had the Lou Pizza with their special sausage added.  This pizza was everything we had hoped for and worth the wait.  we would eat there again any time!
