Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Every time we come to Chicago we always stop by Lou Malnati's and bring their frozen deep dish pizzas back home to the Bay Area friends to share and try. When we bring home the frozen pizzas we put them in the oven to bake and head up and we add extra butter on the bottom of the pan. It just makes Â the crust even more buttery.
