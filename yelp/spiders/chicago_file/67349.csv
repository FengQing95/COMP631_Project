Little Goat Diner////Innovative and creative dishes for brunch throughout the menu. We got the Piggy goes to China and the Spanish Omelette. Both were fantastic and completely new takes on breakfast items I didn't even know were possible. Piggy goes to China had this great tasting biscuit that when combined with meat was one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had. Spanish Omelette was a truly original take on a well-known dish. The tostada-style tortilla chips perfectly complemented the onions and tomatoes in and on top of the omelette. How come I hadn't thought of that! Very delicious brunch. That was probably the best vegetarian breakfast dish I've ever had. Service on the other hand was truly a hit and miss. Server took 5-10 mins to hand us menus, ignored us for most of the meal, was hard to find when we wanted the check and was in general so-so. Barring the service, however, the meal was honestly hands down a very good brunch place.
