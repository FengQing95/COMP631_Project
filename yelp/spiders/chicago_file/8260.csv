Art Institute of Chicago////Although pricey at $25 for an out-of-towner, the Institute is a must see and this is coming from a native New Yorker. Â With a superb Monet room, Tiepolos to rival the best in Italy, Manet's pair of haunting beggars and the almost cliche American Gothic, it's a feast for the eyes!
