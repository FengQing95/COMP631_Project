Little Goat Diner////Came here for breakfast while visiting in Chicago. Every employee we encountered was super nice and helpful, and even gave us other Chicago recommendations. The corned beef and hash was good, and not pictured are the biscuits and gravy. They were mostly flavorless which is kind of a bummer because it's a more expensive spot to eat. Other than that it's a really beautiful environment and nicely decorated.
