Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We got there around 7 and the wait was 1 hr. There's a waiting area and you can eat pizza samples while you wait! How great is that? You can also pre order your deep dish so it's ready when you sit down. Anyway, the wait ended up being way less than an hour, probably closer to 30 min.
