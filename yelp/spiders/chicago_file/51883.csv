Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My boyfriend tried their Bloody Mary bar which was a lot of fun! You get to choose from a glass of vodka/bourbon/gin/tequila and add your own juice and add-ins. They have everything from your classic celery stick to bacon strips to cocktail shrimp on skewers. Would recommend if you like Bloody Marys.
