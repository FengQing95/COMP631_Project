Little Goat Diner////Pretty good but definitely more of a tourist trap than anything else. I had the Bull's Eye French toast and it was very good although nothing more than diner food in my opinion. I also had some of the breads and they were okay but extremely chewy. I went here because I heard the food was amazing but all I found was mediocre food. Fortunately the service was great and the guy behind the coffee bar was extremely friendly and helpful.
