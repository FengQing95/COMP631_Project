Little Goat Diner////I think I loved EVERYTHING about Little Goat except for the food I ordered.  I loved the branding, the atmosphere, the restaurant decor, the stellar staff, the bakery shop next door...everything else but the food. Perhaps I need to come back and order something else.  Oh and I thought it was so cute to have a free button machine right in front! Gosh I love the branding of Little Goat!
