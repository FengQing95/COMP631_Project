Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Sensational pizza, Chicago's favorite and for a good reason. The deep dish pizza sets the standard for Chicago style. I happen to prefer a thin crust, and it turns out that they also do that very well. As a bonus, our entire family likes their sweet vinaigrette salad dressing (I even found a way to buy it online). Note that since every pizza is made from scratch, the wait at one of their restaurants can be long. We usually call ahead and do carry-out, which turns out to transport very well.
