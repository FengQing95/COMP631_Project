Little Goat Diner////Amazing pork belly home fries! The bullseye breakfast was sweet and savory and really got the spot. I've never had fried chicken with French toast and it was better than any chicken and waffles I've ever had. The wait was relatively long, so we just waited till a spot opened at the bar. Great food though!
