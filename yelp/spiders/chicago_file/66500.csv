Little Goat Diner////This place was amazing!  We even saw Stephanie in the kitchen, working away!  The food was fantastic.  The service was great too.  Our waitress checked in regularly and had a very pleasant disposition.  At the end of the meal, a man who I presume was the manager swung by our table to check in- he was so nice.
