Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////First we tried a pitcher of their mango sangria.  It was VERY good and quickly got us into the mood to order several dishes that were all excellent.  Everything was seasoned and cooked perfectly, served quickly and tasted delicious. Despite the smaller sized portions, we all had plenty to sample and the variety made the meal interesting as well as tasty.  Soon we had another pitcher of their sangria (special of the day) and that was very refureshing and fruity.
