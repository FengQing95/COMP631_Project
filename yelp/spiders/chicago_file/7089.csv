Art Institute of Chicago////And around a corner I shockingly came to a painting I was just at that moment recalling, a woman reclining in bed, one breast boldly yet naturally exposed. And there she was, as if I had dreamt her up. I was so shocked, I said to the guard: "they rearrange these galleries a lot, don't they?" "No, ma'm," he replied. It was strange because I remember her differently on, another wall. I felt as if I had finally visited enough, that I was being greeted. My friends were saying hello.
