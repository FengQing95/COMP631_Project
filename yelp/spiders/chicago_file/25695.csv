Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I lived in downtown Chicago for over 3 years and this is my favorite Chicago style deep-dish place. It was just blocks away from my home and I went there often. The pizza is outstanding. Crust, sauce, cheese, and pepperoni will rock your world. And for a starter I would recommend getting the garlic bread. Best in the world! Nothing even compares to their garlic bread. Go there, eat there, and maybe fall in love there.
