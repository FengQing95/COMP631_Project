Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Not worth it.  After a night of boozing (Prohibition Tour), we came to Lou Malnati's for some pizza.  We checked in, pre-ordered our food, and waited patiently.  When we were finally seated, we still had to wait quite a while for our food.  When we finally were served, the pizza was just so-so.  The sauce was too garlicky, the crust both doughy and crunchy, the toppings too heavily proportioned.  It was good enough to take back to our hotel for a midnight snack, but not so good I plan on going back.  My search for the perfect Chicago pizza continues.
