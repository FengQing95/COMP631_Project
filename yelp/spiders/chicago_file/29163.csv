Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Alas, my pizza arrived..half pepperoni half sausage. Omg, so good. The crust was nice and crispy and my first bite and a burst of flavor. Pizza was expertly made as it left me to wonder how the toppings don't fall off.  You can taste all the ingredients in every bite, pepperoni, cheese, sauce, crystal working in perfect harmony.  So glad I made the decision to go here.  Now I need to go back to giordanos and have myself a little contest.
