The Purple Pig////Excellent place, but if you don't want to wait go during their down time.  My daughter and I had a late lunch and sat at the bar for quick service.  Bartender had great knowledge of wine pairing!  Loved the bone marrow and the eggplant bruschetta.  Truly a food adventure!  We were initially disappointed that they were out of the mushroom shawarma but after our meal, we didn't even care!  We will go back and order that next time!  Can't wait!
