The Purple Pig////2) The bartender informed me he would not be able to serve me until I had a seat. So I stood there with ice water (which at least he offered while I was waiting) and a seat opened in less than 20 minutes. Â It took another 10 minutes for the bartender to clear the plates of who left and acknowledge me sitting at the bar. It took me waiving and asking for a menu. First he only handed me the wine book, I had to separately ask for the food menu. Very strange in a place with such popularity!
