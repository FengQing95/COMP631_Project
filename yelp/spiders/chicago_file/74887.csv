Little Goat Diner////A perfectly cooked salmon served family style (with a szechuan chile sauce, veggies, and a yogurt sauce) was divine. Had a crisp layer at the top but was perfectly flaky and tender inside. Bowls of a green curry roasted pork shank. I don't know where a shank comes from, but these were some big ol meaty bones that melted in my mouth. At no point was a knife needed. (There was def some parsley or cilantro in this dish, and I hate them both. But it was so good, I didn't care. I went back for seconds and thirds). Â
