Smoque BBQ////This place blew my mind.  Easily the best BBQ in Chicago.  Just walking past the doorway you can smell the goodness.  It's a little bizarre how you order and then the employee next to the register tells you where to sit, but nonetheless I found the employees all very friendly.  Try the mac n cheese, it's unlike anything I've had before.  I plan on taking all of my friends here at some point.
