Smoque BBQ////We came in with a group of 9 and they quickly accommodated us. Very good service, the guys working the tables were so friendly. The food is so tasty and you definitely can taste the smoke. I love the mac and cheese you can tell it's homemade. We definitely will be back to try more items on the menu.
