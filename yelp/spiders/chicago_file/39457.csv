Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We started with shrimp cocktails and oysters brought out on the iced platter. Those were all very good and ice cold. Followed by salads which we ordered 1 large size and 1 small size. These were shared between the 6 of us. Next we're steaks. 1 rib eye, 1 filet and 1 steak and fries (I think it was a rib eye). All were cooked great. The rib eye flavoring was better than my filet and the medium rare on the filet I though was more to the rare side, still good but not as good. Sides were baked potato and asparagus which were very good. The baked potato order was actually 2 potatoes with sour cream and bacon. Loved em.
