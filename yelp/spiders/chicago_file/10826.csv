Art Institute of Chicago////If you don't want kids in your museum maybe best not to have a family day. Staff was rude and acted as if we were goi g to touch an piece we were several feet from, repeatedly told me to be careful and we were just standing there. Perhaps you need better trained staff or markers to keep people back but we weren't any closer than anyone else. Sorry to have wasted our time to come here
