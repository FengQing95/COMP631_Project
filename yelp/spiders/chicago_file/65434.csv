Smoque BBQ////Always a good time at Smoque. I usually go for their pulled pork sandwich (a half sandwich if we're stopping in for lunch) but I recently tried their Texas sausage and it was divine. It looks like they just introduced a spicy version of one of their BBQ sauces, and it went incredibly well with the sausage. I haven't tried their brisket, but my dad is a big fan of it. The coleslaw here is great: light, vinegar-y and a good counterpart to the rich meats and side dishes. I always enjoy their Mac and cheese side, and no meal here is complete without their fantastic pecan bread pudding.
