Smoque BBQ////This is some good ol' Smoque BBQ with some great Southern Sides.  Now I think of myself as a bit of a connoisseur of BBQ.  Let me tell you about my tasting Resume: Salt Lick, City Market, Black's and Rudy's to name a few.  This place is great and I will add it to my favorite BBQ joints in Chicago....oh wait!?  This is the only place so far in Chicago to make me review, desire more of, and want to tell friends about!
