Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Move over Zachary's... but I've just tried the REAL THING... don't get me wrong people... I will always love Zachary's... closest to the real thing to a Chicago style deep dish pizza... but Lou Malnati's Pizza just melted in my mouth with every bite!  With a oh so tasty buttery crust... the sauce having just the right amount of tomatoes and the cheese wasn't as overwhelming (as it can at times with Zach's)... but none the less... pure joy!  We had the sausage deep dish, a Lou Malnati's house salad which had the crunchiest, yet very flavorful bacon bits that were real and not artificial... and don't forget to order a beer!  For me... pizza and beer... can't beat that!
