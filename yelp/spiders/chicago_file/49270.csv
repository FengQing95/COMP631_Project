Smoque BBQ////My husband is from the Kansas City area so finding BBQ in Chicago that lives up to those standards is a challenge. When we first visited Smoque a few years ago we weren't terribly impressed but because everyone loves it so much we decided to give it another try and I'm glad we did; I thought our meal was much better this time around. We had the sliced brisket with sides of fries, mac n cheese, and cornbread and everything was really, really good. The brisket was very moist and had a nice smoke flavor although my husband did comment that there wasn't the nice smoke ring that some people think is The sign of great brisket. No smoke ring needed here in my opinion, it was great without it! The small order of fries is HUGE and more than enough for 2 people to share. There will almost always be a line so be prepared for a bit of a wait, although they do a great job of getting people seated quickly. Smoque is also BYOB so if you're dining in bring a bottle of wine or beer and enjoy!
