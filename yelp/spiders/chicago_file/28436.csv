Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou's deep dish certainly lacks the cheesy goodness and volume of toppings that Giordano's or Art of Pizza boast and it also doesn't have that light fluffy crust that Pequod's can boast. Plus I find the wait, especially at this location, to be much lengthier - Giordano's especially just seems to turn tables a little more quickly.
