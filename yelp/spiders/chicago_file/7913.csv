Art Institute of Chicago////I have been here twice, and it did not disappoint either time.  The AIC has a great balance of cutting edge, classic and modern art.  Their exhibits incorporate interactive pieces, everyday life, and classic art.  Some of the highlights include the mural sized Seurat in their impressionist section, the Lichtenstein special exhibit, and some of the Jackson Pollock's.
