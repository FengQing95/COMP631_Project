Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My first time in Bavette, even though I like steaks in Chicago. We could not make a reservation for Monday which was surprising, however they have 3 walk-in tables, we walked in and got a table. The restaurant was full on Monday all night long, we had a great  dinner: the food was good, wine list was decent even though not a long one. Asparagus side tasted very good but in general food was a little bit  over salted, I ordered RIbeye steak CHICAGO cut, it was very tasty but overstated. Another guest ordered lamb which was Colorado lamb!
