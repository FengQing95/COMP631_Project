Art Institute of Chicago////Culture at it's best in Chicago. They have a coat check off the modern wing entrance. Also, use that entrance. You get in much quicker there with a way shorter line than off the front entrance by the lions. Very clean and well maintained. I love the light fragrance of their polish. Not everyone can smell it but I can. The gallery attendants are a little too quick to jump in you are getting too close to the art. There's no way I would touch anything. I'm just severely myopic (so extremely nearsighted that I need to get close to see even with glasses on). There are plenty of benches to rest on or enjoy a piece of art that you are particularly enjoying.
