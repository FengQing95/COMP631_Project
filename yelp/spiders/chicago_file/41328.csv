Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love this place, food is always good, Sangria is easy and not badly priced and I will say, its a great first date place to go.  I will say its my favorite Tapas place in the city of Chicago.  I do recommend making reservations.  If you do not want to be at a place with a huge crowd and that can be loud, I would not recommend it for you.
