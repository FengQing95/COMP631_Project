Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here last week with a group of 10 and met beforehand in the bar. We came here to honor my son. My experience as I've been here several times before is that the bar service is just too slow. Which is why I took off a star. They only had one bartender and it was dinner time and getting drinks for our group was slow. This is happened in the past so I don't know if that's just how they operate their bar area. We had pictures of the red sangria and the carve a sangria. My recollection of the cava sangria wasn't the same as what we were served. So I don't know if that recipe has been changed. You can't lose with any of the sangrias that they serve there. A few people in our group and individual drinks and they were quite happy with them as well.
