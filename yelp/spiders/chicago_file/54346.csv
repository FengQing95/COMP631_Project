Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Oh, my gosh! Our daughter and son-in-law treated us to brunch here for my birthday.  It was our first experience and w loved every bite and every minute. The staff is high energy and friendly.  The Tappas are beautifully presented and oh-so delicious. I hope we get to go again sometime. It was the best birthday brunch ever!
