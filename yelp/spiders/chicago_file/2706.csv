The Purple Pig////A must visit! Service is great.. James our waiter at the bar was friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating. The food is amazing. Really enjoyed watching the kitchen chefs work in tandem preparing a myriad of delectable dishes, tasting the every prepared dish before sending to customer . Have only been in Chicago 2 days and this is a second visit! Â Absolutely no complaints with the braised duck, hot dog wine choices,.....! Continued success and best in of luck as you expand!!!
