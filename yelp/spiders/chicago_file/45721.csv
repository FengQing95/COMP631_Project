Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Food = amazing. Did a bunch of stuff....chicken and chorizo skewer things, goat cheese in tomato sauce, chicken empanada, calamari, skirt steak, some kind of salty ham (amazing), and a paella. Said paella was amazing and had a smoky taste...and I wish I had a never-ending supply of this inside of my oven --- just open up the door and, hey!, paella! how much would that would rock?
