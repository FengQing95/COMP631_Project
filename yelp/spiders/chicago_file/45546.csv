Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////With this many reviews, what else can one really say? Get the bacon wrapped dates, and the spicy potatoes, and the goat cheese. We also had a yummy chicken and artichoke paella that filled my belly right up. The food comes quickly and my sangria glass always finds a way of staying filled. I would advise getting their black raspberry sangria - I like sweet but it was even a little too sweet for my liking. Go with the traditional or the peach is really great too.
