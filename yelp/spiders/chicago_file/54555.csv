Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I really love this place food wise, definitely a place you go with other people who all want to share food. I can't stress enough how great the food is! There will almost always be a wait, a long one. But a couple times I've been told and hour and half wait or more, then been messaged 15 minutes later saying a table was ready....?..... And the service can be very slow.
