Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The deep dish pizza was extremely heavy. We carried both pizzas through the O'hare International Airport. People all over the airport stopped us to tell us how much they love Lou Malnati's pizza. By the time we had both pizzas at home they were cold. We reheated them in our convection oven and they tasted absolutely heavenly. The crust on the deep dish pizza was buttery and had the right amount of crunch, the sauce was zesty and flavorful, and they had a good amount of toppings to make the combo. The thin crust was delicious, the cheese and sausage were made to perfection.
