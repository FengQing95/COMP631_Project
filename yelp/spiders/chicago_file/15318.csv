Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Take advantage of the pre-ordering when there is a long wait.  We showed up a little after 6pm on a Friday night and there was more than an hour long wait.  We put our order with the hostess so we were able to have our pizza on our table within 10 minutes of being seated.  Good thing too, because I was starving!
