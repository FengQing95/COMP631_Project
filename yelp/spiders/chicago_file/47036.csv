Smoque BBQ////I wish there was such thing as 6 stars!!!   Oh my goodness this place is so good.  If you haven't been there, shut the computer off right now, grab your car keys, and go.  It's so good.  A buddy and I went up there for lunch.  It was pretty busy, but went really quickly.  I ordered the half and half.  It's half a pulled pork and half a sliced brisquet.  When they called my number, I noticed they only gave me a half brisquet and forgot the pulled pork.  I must have looked puzzled or something because from behind me a manager or something came up to me and said, "did we forget something?" I said, "yes I thought I ordered a half and half but looks like maybe I only ordered a half".  He said, "oh my gosh I'm sorry about that, no problem, go ahead and sit down and I'll bring you the other half".  WOW!  That's awesome.  Within a minute here he comes with my pulled pork.  Both were so good.  The cole slaw is a great oil based one and the mac n cheese was the bomb!!!!  My buddy got some fresh cut french fries which I tried and I would also recommend.  I'm going again as soon as possible.
