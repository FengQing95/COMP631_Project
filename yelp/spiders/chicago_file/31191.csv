Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was the first place we went once we landed in Chicago! We got The "Lou" which was the veggie pizza. So easy to over order! You may think you need a medium because you're hungry but you only truly need a small for 2 people. We had most of the pizza come home with us and ate over the course of our stay.
