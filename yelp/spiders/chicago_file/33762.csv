Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////On my first night, on my first visit to Chicago I was treated to this special restaurant.  I experienced outstanding service and delicious menu options.  Loved the fact you could bring your own bottle of wine with no corkage fee, only proviso is that you must share one glass with someone of your choice, or theirs, in the restaurant.  What a lovely "pay it forward" policy.
