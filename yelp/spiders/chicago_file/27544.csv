Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered the 9" pizza because I'm a hungry girl. The single probably would have been sufficient. They pride themselves on Wisconsin mozzarella and California tomatoes for the sauce. There was a nice sweetness to both, and the crust was crisp on the bottom yet doughy. I thought the crust could have been more buttery and lacked salt. They put the cheese on top of the crust, what we call an "upside down slice" in New York. That is followed by lean sausage, and then tomato sauce on top. It was tasty.
