Art Institute of Chicago////The collection is overwhelmingly good, even in comparison to the National Gallery and the Metropolitan. We (my three kids and I) somehow spent five hours here. The facility is gorgeous and very peaceful even with hordes of people there. We had a lovely if over-priced lunch, and the cafe upstairs is a nice resting coffee & treat spot if you can find a chair.
