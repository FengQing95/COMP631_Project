Smoque BBQ////Okay, so this place must be good. An hour later we sit down with a sample of everything on the menu--pulled pork, brisket, chicken, ribs, mac & cheese, fries, cole slaw, and baked beans. Was it worth the wait? Hell yes. Everything was fantastic. The long line did not lie. My favorites were the pulled pork, mac & cheese, and fries.
