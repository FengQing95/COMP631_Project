Little Goat Diner////I love love love LOVE this place. I love the atmosphere /decor! It's a mix of the old diner vibes and a new modern take! You NEED to try the little goat chili cheese fries! They are my absolute favorite guilty pleasure :)! One thing I love is compared to the other restaurants around the area Little Goat gets you seated faster! The most I have ever waited was 30mins (and that was on a saturday night)! It's a great place for brunch for small or big parties.
