Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When we come to Chicago, we want to make sure we get pizza. We had to wait for the pizza, which is standard. However, when the pizza showed up it was cold toward the middle, which was disappointing. We were hungry, the server had too many tables, and we really didn't want to wait for more pizza.
