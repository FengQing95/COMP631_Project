Little Goat Diner////Have been here several times and they rarely disappoint. You need to be a somewhat adventurous eater to go here because some of the flavor combinations are out there. If you like good food and like trying new things this place is for you. Reasonably priced, always great service, and great food. The only reason I've ever been disappointed is that they took the Turtle Pie off the menu :( it was the best dessert possibly ever. RIP Turtle Pie.
