Little Goat Diner////The chocolate chip pancakes--this was a huge portion. Three chocolate pancakes studded with chocolate crispies and served with chocolate malt butter.  My son was content with just dipping pieces of the pancake in the chocolate butter so the syrup that was brought out was forgotten.  He was so right, that's all the pancake needed, just a bit of that chocolate butter.  Delicious! and chocolate butter? Ingenious!  This was a huge portion so leftovers were appreciated at home later for dinner.
