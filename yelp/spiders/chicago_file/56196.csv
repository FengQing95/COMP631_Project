Smoque BBQ////This is excellent BBQ! I have had the pulled pork sandwich (my favorite), have tried the brisket (if you get it as a sandwich sliced is juicier and chopped dryer but leaner FYI), and I've enjoyed the sides of cornbread, baked beans, like homemade mac and Â cheese, and the fries!! All excellent. Every time I bring someone here, they are hooked!! Just yummy! You'll thank me later!
