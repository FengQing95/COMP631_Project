Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////A busy dinner for a Wednesday night, but can't complain about it because that's not something to lose a star over. The host staff was friendly and quoted us our wait time with accuracy to the minute. Our server for the night was helpful and joyful as well as timely. Perceived our needs and met them. Even recommended a few other local eateries and touristy things to do (we are from LA). The calamari with its chunky marinara dip and wings with Gorgonzola cheese sauce Â were both cooked wonderfully. We were asked to order our pizza when we put our name in for seating which worked out well. The pizza was amazing!
