Smoque BBQ////Everything else is superb.  The cornbread was the best I've had in my life, and I've had some cornbread a time or ten thousand.  Holy crap.  Everything was just great.  You must go here.  It's cheap and not too far away and there's street parking...so really, you have no excuse not to go.  Dine in, get carryout, whatever, just get up and go already!
