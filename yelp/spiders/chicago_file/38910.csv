Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food is fabulous, definitely one of my favorite steakhouses in Chicago. We ordered the bone marrow which was smothered in cilantro but other than that was delicious. The Traditional Filet Mignon and Dry Aged Bone In New York Strip were cooked perfectly and you could tell that the quality of meat was amazing. I definitely recommend the New York Strip and the Wild Mushrooms to any foodie.
