Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The space is nice and the food is generally good, but at no point was I ever wowed. Given the cost, I'd like to think that at least one one savory item would be memorable. Contrast this with a recent trip to Swift & Sons, where every item we ordered was at least a full notch above comparable items from Bavette's. I left there thinking about a return trip; I left Bavette's wishing I went back to Swift & Sons.
