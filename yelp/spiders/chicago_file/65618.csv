Smoque BBQ////Other notes - the sliced brisket is the best thing since sliced bread. Get a fatty slice with bark and it's a perfect bite. Recently, I've been into popping the candied jalapenos like they're m&m's. Their sides ain't no slouch either. have had a one off experience of somewhat dry brisket catering once in all my visits. It stood out so much because it was an anomaly and it was still good.
