Smoque BBQ////Sides...  this was not southern-style cole slaw.  It tasted of vinegar and seasonings with a little oil of some kind.  Cole slaw dressing is mayonnaise, sugar, vinegar and seasonings - which seasonings depends on who's making it.  My GF (initially very excited about eating slaw) took one bite and spit it out.  The mac & cheese was the same stuff I got a Luby's Cafeteria with my grandma as a kid.  I don't what BBQ beans are but we don't have them in Texas or NC.  We have baked beans, which should be a combination of pinto beans, ketchup, brown sugar, bacon and seasonings.  These were swimming in a thin sauce with onions tasted like they had Liquid Smoke in them.  Cornbread was from Jiffy Corn Muffin mix - $1.00 at the local supermarket.  It wasn't bad, I like Jiffy Corn muffins.
