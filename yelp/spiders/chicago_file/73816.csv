Little Goat Diner////Wow. I have to say, I wasn't expecting anything amazing from a little diner, even if it was a new, hip type of one. My boyfriend and I went because we couldn't get into Au Cheval originally, but I'm so glad we didn't get in and went here instead. We got the nachos as a starter (which were really big enough to share for a meal on its own!) and ate them all in stunned silence sheerly out of being so in awe of our food. I have never tasted nachos like that. They were tangy, sweet, cheesy, meaty, and a little bit spicy. I know, I'm overwhelmed, too. So many flavors that seemingly shouldn't go together that worked in sheer harmony. It then turned into a race to see who could get the piece with the most meat and cheese. Did I dream about the nachos that night? You bet I did. You probably think I'm being funny, but I'm not. Now I'm wondering if that says more about my obsession with food or the nachos... definitely still the nachos.
