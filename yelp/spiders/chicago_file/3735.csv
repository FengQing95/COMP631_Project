The Purple Pig////Tapas like menu, extensive drink and wine list.  Make sure you order to share.  Location is super solid as it is a few steps from Michigan Av and the River.  They don't take reservations so go at off peak times.  We got there on Sunday (summer) at 4 and they gave us table in 15 minutes.  Best of food was: pork belly w Sirloin, fried broccoli and beats.  Bear in mind I am a meat eater, so including 2 mostly vegetable suggestions means they really do a good job on both.  Their pig shoulder and roasted octopus were also tasty.  They had interesting non alcoholic drinks for minors (orange is the new).  Service was very attentive to details and our waiter was very adept in suggestions that were spot on.  Will give 5 stars if they enable Yelp's add me to the line or take reservations.
