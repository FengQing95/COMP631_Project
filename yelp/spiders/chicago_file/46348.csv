Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place has pretty tasty items on the menu. If I had the stomach for it I would probably try one of everything in one night!  Our waiter was awesome about answering our questions about some of the menu items.  We thought about ordering the paella but made the mistake of eating A LOT of bread with each of our tapas choices.  We ordered [I'm going to put the separate dishes in parentheses since it usually just lists the ingredients] the (wood roasted peppers, eggplant, and tomato), the calamari, the (goat cheese, pistachio, mint and nispera preserves), the (niçoise coquillo olive tapenade), the (fried green peppers and coarse salt), and the (shrimp with garlic, olive oil, red pepper flakes).
