Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My my my! This is by far the best deep dish pizza I have ever tried. Tip for the wise, PRE ORDER!!!! Deep dish pizza takes an hour to make. I recommend ordering about 45-50 minutes ahead and sit down with appetizers. The calamari is exquisite. I'm a classic girl and I got the original. It was great. We added meatballs and it made my day.
