Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We went without reservation on a Saturday late night (after 9pm) and was able to find a seat at the bar downstairs.  It has a nice speakeasy vibe. But it does get very loud and it's pretty dark downstairs. The bartender was really nice and attentive.  Drinks are good.  Ribeye was pretty good but when it's paired with the bone marrow.. OMG! The pairing makes the steak is so much richer and juicier.  Roasted brocolli was just that.. but for $14?? that's ridiculous.
