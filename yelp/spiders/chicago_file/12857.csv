Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The butter crust is what makes Lou's the best pizza on the planet. I am partial to deep dish as it is and I love Gino's but nothing can top this. I have been going to Lou's since I was barely able to finish a slice. Now, there is fight over how many pizzas to get shipped to Scottsdale to last until our next trip home. While the frozen pizzas are no where near the feeling of dining in, they make you feel like waiting for the next trip to Chicago won't be that bad.
