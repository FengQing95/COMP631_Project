Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I visited this restaurant for the first time a few weeks ago and really enjoyed it! The service was really amazing, we sat in the basement which I also thought had a more fun vibe then the main floor. My boyfriend ordered the Oysters which were definitely his least favorite part (he has had better else where), but the rest of our meal was wonderful! I tried the fried chicken which was better than I expected as it was boneless which was a nice surprise! Would definitely return here again, great atmosphere and good food!
