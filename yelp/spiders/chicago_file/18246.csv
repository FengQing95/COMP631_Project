Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This one is my favorite of the popular deep dish pizzas. I actually really recommend doing the veggie stuffed pizza - it's delicious! The environment is also fun and the waiters have always been super nice. I live right next to one and the temptation is always there! Be prepared though because deep dish pizza is heavy!
