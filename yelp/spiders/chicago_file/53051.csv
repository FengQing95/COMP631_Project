Smoque BBQ////The food is prepared to perfection and is delicious. BBQ is amazing, the fries are fantastic, cole slaw is really good - try it even if you don't like slaw. (it comes with anyway) The atmosphere is nonexistent unless you consider metal prison trays and people yelling numbers atmosphere. But hey - If you go to a BBQ joint for atmosphere you are probably leading a disappointed life already.
