Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////At first I wasn't sure I wanted to come here because it only has a collective 3 and a half stars here and I put a lot of trust in what Yelp has to say. But someone in my party of four had heard from a friend they trust that this place was good, so we went. And I've got to say, sometimes you just have to try places even if Yelp doesn't give them 5 stars because, get ready, sometimes everyone's perceptions and opinions aren't the same! Shocking I know!
