Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My favorite Chicago style deep dish of all time. Their incredible tomato sauce is what separates them from the competition in my opinion. My go to is usually pepperoni and spinach, but they have other excellent options. Not a fan of the chicken sausage, but that's not a big deal. Great salad and appetizer sampler as well.
