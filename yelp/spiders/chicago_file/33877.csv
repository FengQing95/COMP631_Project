Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Started with the beef tongue, then the shortrib stroganoff, and the classic ribeye.  Beef tongue melted in your mouth, the way it's supposed to.  The ribeye was cooked perfectly too, but the real standout was the stroganoff.  I don't know what kind of high-grade crack cocaine they sprinkled on it, but it definitely did the trick.
