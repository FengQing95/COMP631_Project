Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////What a terrific spot! Came here to help a friend celebrate her business successes. This place seems like a small place on the outside, but it's plenty big inside. Nice crown...even on a Thursday night. The food is delicious and served tapas style so you can try a number of dishes without over eating (that much). Here is something on the menu for everyone to enjoy. The sangria is outta this world. Flavorful, light, smooth...and served in big glasses. Be careful tho, the alcohol in stuff creeps up on you!
