Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Absolutely impeccable service and food! This is certainly one of the best restaurants we've been to in Chicago. We came for my wife's birthday, and had a blast. Every dish was better than the next, coupled with awesome service. Our waiter gave great recommendations, fast and kind service and it was just SO GOOD. You should come the next time you visit Chicago.
