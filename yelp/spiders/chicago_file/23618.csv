Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Excellent gluten free pizza! Usually pizza places under cook the GF pizza and its soft and just...gross. This crust was thin and crunchy. Perhaps a bit too crunchy for some, but I loved it! **For those with Celiac or severe gluten allergies, the menu does warn that Lou's GF pizza does come into contact with cutting/prep surfaces that are also used for gluten-iferous foods.
