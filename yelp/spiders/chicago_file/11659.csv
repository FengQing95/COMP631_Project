Art Institute of Chicago////It's amazing! You have to stop by for a look, if you are in Chicago. I was lucky enough to make a visit recently and I love it here. My friend and I were in the city for the day and we had a lot planned... but this place is huge and we pretty much spent 90% of our day exploring the amazing art.
