Little Goat Diner////The first time I went I was mesmerized by the place, by this last trip the wonder has worn off and all I am left with is a monster stomach ache.  Think greasy spoon (I mean REALLY greasy) meets stuffy, pretentious pan-asian highbrow dinning. Corn beef and hash was nothing but slimy bacon DRENCHED in oily cheese.  I am talking inedible quantities of oil, butter, grease, cheese.  Their asian burger was gross, squash bun with kimchi.  Fries are unexciting.  Hashbrowns are so greasy and cheesy you cannot consume them.  Tuna melt mixes pickled vegetables, the richest cheese sauce I have ever consumed soaked the entire bread and pungent fish meat.
