Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////How AWESOME is it that they deliver nationally?!?! My boss ordered the Best Value (6 small-9" pizzas for 99.95). We got the 3 pepperoni/3 sausage; we ordered on Wednesday and they were delivered to us on Friday morning, still frozen thanks to the awesome styrofoam box and dry ice! The moment our treasure trove was delivered, we opened it immediately and popped one into our toaster oven. The cook time was 45 minutes so as it was cooking and the aura of pizza heaven wafted our office, we were all ready to eat when it was done! As soon as it was done, we popped in a second pizza to cook while we ate.
