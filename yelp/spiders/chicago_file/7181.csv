Art Institute of Chicago////The best museum in Chicago and probably one of the best collections of impressionist works in the entire United States.  I recently saw the Lichtenstein exhibit there, which was great, but don't miss out on all the Renoir and Van Gogh's.  Awesome stuff.  Free to Illinois residents on the 1st 2 Wednesdays of the month! Yee!
