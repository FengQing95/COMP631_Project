Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had lunch today at Lou Malnati pizzeria . I don't understand how the restaurant has such a good reputation . The three different pizzas we ordered had the same taste . Where is the culinary touch ? They were so heavy, all we can taste is butter. We had to wait 40 minutes to get the order . So deceived :( Never again .
