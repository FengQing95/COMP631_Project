Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I first visited this place about 15 years ago and it was great. And it still is. I love the goat cheese, the patatas bravas, and sangrias.  It is a busy place and you might have to wait a bit but its worth it.   The service is good, the food is great and I love the ambiance.  Good date place and good family-friendly place.  Try the passion fruit sangria. yum
