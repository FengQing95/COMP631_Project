Smoque BBQ////Basically, I tried everything and everything was OK. It wasn't mind blowing. And if I'm being critical, the meat was just too bland. Without the sauce their wasn't much "Smoque." Really, where's the smokey flavor from properly smoked BBQ? If your joint is called "Smoque", shouldn't Â the food have that signature BBQ flavor/smell?
