Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It's been too long since I've tried a real Chicago deep dish and Lou Malnati's did and excellent job reminding me how different a deep dish from Chicago can be than the one you get at your home town.  The crust was absolutely delicious.  It was buttery, crispy...simply breathtaking.  The sauce and cheese were also wonderful.  I shared a deluxe medium with my friend and it was so filling I could barely breathe afterwards.  The deluxe comes with sausage, peppers, onions, and mushrooms.  The sausage wasn't the best I've tried, but the crust and sauce more than made up for that.  If you come here, I recommend going for the front room.  The front room feels more like a Chicago pizza.  The back room can get noisy and is a pretty standard room with some sports memorabilia and two TVs.
