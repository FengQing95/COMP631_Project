Little Goat Diner////The Fat Elvis Waffles are spectacular.  I'm still having visions of thick waffles doused in peanut butter-butter, and bacon maple syrup.    The kimchee egg & bacon pancake is another great dish; I loved the interesting mish mash of flavors although it could have used a bit more "zing".   We all could easily envision a return trip just to eat platters of hash browns and bacon; they were so fabulous.
