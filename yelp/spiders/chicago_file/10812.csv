Art Institute of Chicago////Tip:  I recommend you buy your ticket in ADVANCE and have a copy of it with you either in paper or on your phone because we were able to bypass the general admission line and use the fast line.  We didn't know this, we just took a chance and asked one of the line guys.  Keep in mind we bought our tickets across the street at the drug store on our phones.  So it makes ZERO sense to NOT do this.  We also bought the general admission ticket and NOT the more expensive fast admission.  Maybe we just got lucky and bypassed the line?  Who knows.
