Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Me and my sisters meals were really good! The Sourdough bread was really good! And the waitress was really nice and she knows what she's doing! The service was really good! They got me another iced tea with out even asking! Way to go! I will come back here! Â It's worth the big bill! Everyone was really nice and friendly!
