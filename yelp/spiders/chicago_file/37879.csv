Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We sat down at a corner, our waiter came off a little snobby at first. But after I gave him a couple of dirty looks ( ask me how), he actually turned out to be fine. The drinks were very good, we had the Bavette's punch, the martini, and old fashioned cognac, and some bourbon. I could think of only a few places that I'd just go for drinks and now Bavette is one of them.
