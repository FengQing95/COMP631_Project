Smoque BBQ////Last night, though, I felt like I had returned to the Kansas City mothership when I ordered carry-out from Smoque. The sliced brisket is truly amazing, and both types of ribs are great. It really is smoked BBQ heaven. Also, the mac and cheese (piping hot) rocks and the peach cobbler is the perfect perfect way to finish off the meal.
