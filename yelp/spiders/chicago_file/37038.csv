Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As I enter the restaurant, I am slightly unnerved.  I tell the host I have a reservation, which is acknowledged.  I am told to sit down on couches and wait.  I do.   In stroll a couple who are Ken and Barbie knockoffs.  They are seated immediately.  I am still sitting on a couch.  I am hungry and I have spent most of the day in a Cops episode.  I kindly ask the host if they are having a problem seating me.   The host clues in that I am mildly annoyed.  A table is found.  I don't like the table.  It's not as nice as Ken and Barbie's table and in my crap mood, I am not prepared to settle.  Inside, there's a lot of 20s and 30s music, which I am not feeling.
