Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Having visited Art of Pizza when my family was too full to enjoy it, we opted for another go around with the windy city's pizza after spending a few hours in Millennium Park and wandering about Michigan Avenue.  Parking all the way back at the park and hiking the three quarters of a mile was not my mother's idea of fun given the city's street/sidewalk quality, but the weather was beautiful and a walk was in order after the gluttony of previous days.  While Chicago foodies will argue back and forth until the end of time about whether Uno's founder Ike Sewell or employee Rudy Malnati (whose sons own both Lou Malnati's and Pizano's) originally invented the deep-dish, all I wanted was an excellent pie.  As my sister had been to Uno and we'd all tried Giordano's in the past, the choice was Lou Malnati's or Gino's East - we opted for Lou's.
