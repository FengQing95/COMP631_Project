The Purple Pig////Being a typical tourist, I practically ordered everything that were recommended and most popular. We started with the beef tendon chips and some rose sangria. The chips were crunchy and savory; rose sangria was refreshing and perfect sweetness. Truly 5-star experience and great for Happy Hour.
