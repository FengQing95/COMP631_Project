Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My first Chicago pizza experience was terrible! We arrive and order a pizza so it cooks while we wait for a table. 1 hour later, we are seated, which takes 5 more minutes just to be greeted. Our server was not attentive the entire time. After waiting about another 20min at the table, the pizza comes out. I'm not joking, the pizza was cold to the point that the cheese was solid in the center. I other tables' food looked great but ours was sad. We just paid and left because we couldn't sit around another hour for a new pizza because we had a show to catch. Very disappointing service and food!!!
