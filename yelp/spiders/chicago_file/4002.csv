The Purple Pig////Worth the wait! Â This place is always busy. I came here for dinner and the wait was 2.5 hours... Which meant I would have to eat at 11:30pm which I couldn't do. But i did come here the next morning right when they opened and we didn't have to wait. I actually got really lucky because it was already packed and there were only a handful of seats open.
