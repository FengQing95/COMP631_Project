Little Goat Diner////I can't believe how amazing the food is at the price point. If you like smoked salmon, please please try the everything everything crumpets!! A good portion (my friend shared some and it was still plenty) and the crumpets were heavenly and not too rich! I had such an all around amazing time, I would've expected to pay a lot more that $15 for the meal quality!
