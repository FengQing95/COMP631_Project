Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Amazing place to socialize with friends/family all while eating great food! Been here multiple times and every time I bring someone for the first time they instantly fall in love. Highly recommend the sangria, it's not too sweet or too bitter. Literally perfect drink, especially with the paella. Haven't tried out the Bloody Mary bar but heard nothing but great things. Vegetarian options are very limited but delicious nonetheless!
