Little Goat Diner////Third visit: even more mac and cheese and the goat kimchi burger.  It took a lot of willpower not to get the sloppy goat and/or French toast but given how large the menu is, I thought I should branch out.  I'm so happy I did!  The burger was as amazing as the other things I've eaten.
