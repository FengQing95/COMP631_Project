Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My husband & I went here while in the city for the weekend. It was the first night of our Anniversary getaway. One of if not the best deep dish pizza we've ever had. Perfect blend of sauce & toppings. The crust wasn't too thick, & had a nice light buttery crunch to it. High recommendations to go here!! Oh, let's not forget about the spinach cheese bread for an appetizer. Yum!!!
