Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I LOVED the crazy atmosphere of this location; the hostess was calm and friendly despite the four thousand people bumping into her and knocking her around, and we actually got our table BEFORE when she had expected it would be ready.  And I had the BEST conversations with other people in line waiting for a table, with perfect strangers coming up to us to chat about the game!  I'm even a bit claustrophobic in some situations, but the close atmosphere at the restaurant was actually like being somewhere for a jazz session, or at some small party after an indie movie; it was fun, lively, and everyone I could see was full of enthusiasm and having a good time.  VERY MUCH APPRECIATED the sample snacks they made available to people, as a few of us in the crowd were doing the low sugar dance, and it was really cool to have a tiny something to try while you waited.
