Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I came here on a Thursday night with an old friend of mine. The average wait was fourth five minutes to an hour but the bar seating was immediate. The only difference from what I saw was that the bar area lacked natural light. However, it had a really nice date ambience with the candles and dim lighting. We of course sat at the bar tables.
