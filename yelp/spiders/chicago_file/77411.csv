Little Goat Diner////When I die I want this to be where my ethereal body resides. Like hell yes. And they are GLUTEN FREE FRIENDLY! They had a separate menu and everything which always makes me feel loved. I got their omelet of the day, but man- you can't really go wrong here (except my breakfast mate got the bibimbop bowl and said it left much to be desired... but besides that!) Prior to being GF I would always get the Bullseye French toast and I would happily have let that kill me if I wasn't here for work. God bless Stephanie
