Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is an absolute madhouse on the weekends so prepare to wait at the bar for 1-2 hours for a seat. It is well worth it though to hang in the bar despite the fact that you may crammed closer to your neighbor than on a morning red line commute. Â I've tried every flavor sangria, and I love them all! There are abundant veggie tapas options here, so you can go with your carnivorous friends and everyone will be satisfied. The staff are attentive and prompt. This place is great for groups, not as much fun for dates. It is wonderful when summer rolls around and the 4 season room looses it's plastic.
