Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////What a great dining experience . The atmosphere is amazing! The food was excellent. We had the filet mignon, corn, baked macaroni , wedge salad and chocolate cream pie...all were 10's! Great size portions as well. It was the best meal I have had in a very long time. Highly recommend this place!
