Little Goat Diner////The Goat Chilli Cheese Fries as starters is the bomb! I love how you can order breakfast for dinner. For some reason, breakfast food tastes better at night. There's nothing wrong with ordering Dark Chocolate Chip Crunch Pancakes at night. It comes with this awesome chocolate malt butter. One of my favorite side items is the Mac and Cheese. Also you have to try the Sloppy Goat at times. It comes with a tangy, sweet sauce. Also the portions are pretty good for what you pay.
