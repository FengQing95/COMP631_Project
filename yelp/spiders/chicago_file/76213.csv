Little Goat Diner////Nice place in the neighborhood. I usually come here to grab the oatmeal and a latte to go. The oatmeal definitely stands out as a little different to try (pricey but good). Make sure to ask if they have any oatmeal left (if you get there anytime after 9am) as they tend to run out quick.
