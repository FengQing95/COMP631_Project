Art Institute of Chicago////There are a few smalls problems. The first being the lay out. The museum has been expanded over the years, and because of the location near the train tracks, the building is super confusing and hard to navigate. I had to keep back tracking, and going through exhibits I wasn't interested in to find the exhibits I did want to see. I just did not like the set up at all, and found it to be super confusing, and I wasted a lot of time just trying to figure out where to go, and how to get there, etc.
