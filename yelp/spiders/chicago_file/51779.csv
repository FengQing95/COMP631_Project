Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Price is reasonable but keep in mind, because these are small plates, and depending on the size of your party, it may take you quite a few to get satiated. In other words, don't be surprised if your bill falls into the $30-40 range. The one cost-effective tip I'll give you: if you have a party of 2-3, split a sangria pitcher, instead of going glass by glass. I split a pitcher of red with another person and felt like I got a whole lot of sangria out of that thing...definitely my money's worth.
