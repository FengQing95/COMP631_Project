The Purple Pig////Delightful dinner with attentive friendly service. The menu is strong with attractive bits and bites and an extensive wine list. The pork and bacon pate was creamy and flavorful, loved the grape mostarda. The octopus was delicate and roasty. The soecial of the evening was a succulent cut of tender pork - perfectly cooked. Absolutely pleasurable dinner from start to finish.
