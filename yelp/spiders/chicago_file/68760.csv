Little Goat Diner////I have grown up loving corned beef hash, and you have now ruined that dish for me everytime I order it away from LG.   It's been a couple hours and I am still dreaming of your corned beef hash, the finely long thin shreds of potatoes, chopped onions, and thin slices of perfectly tender yet with a terrific slight crisp corned beef.    I took a star off because the over easy eggs were overcooked a bit.  But I will be back.
