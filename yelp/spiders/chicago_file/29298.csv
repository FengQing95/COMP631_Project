Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was super excited about Lou's since a lot of friends told me it was the place go to. Probably the location that I went to really just had an off day, but it was nothing of what I was expecting. There just wasn't enough tomato sauce on this pizza to call it a deep dish. Could the fault be mine because we ordered two pizzas that serves one and not a big pie?
