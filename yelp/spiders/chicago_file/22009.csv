Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////substance sloshing on the pizza, probably from the veggies, the pizza looks like it had been sitting out for ages. I already in my head told myself there's no way this pizza is cooked. I have a tiny bite and it's cold. Not sure why you'd even bring this pizza to someone by the way it looked. They clearly rushed this pizza, probably forgot to bring it out, I don't even know, nobody could explain to us why this took so long or why our pizza was so bad. They offered us another pizza which we accepted but at this point we are just over being there for so long. Waited another 30 minutes, finally got another pizza. Was alright. I guess the whole experience overall made me lose my appetite. We watched 3 sets of people sit and leave by the time we finally got to eat. Not how I wanted to spend my day.
