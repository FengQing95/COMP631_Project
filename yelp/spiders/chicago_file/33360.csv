Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The restaurant is very impressive, beautiful. The food is also pretty good but I ordered a medium rare stake and came medium. My wife ordered a medium and it came medium rare. Not a big issue at all specially because both stakes were delicious. They should have less expensive wines to offer.
