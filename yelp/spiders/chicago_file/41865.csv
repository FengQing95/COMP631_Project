Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////SIMPLY DELICIOUS! We had the pinxtos for an appetizer, then tapas, and finally the dessert pinxtos. The place was popping. It was a 2 hour wait on a Friday night - so don't forget to make reservations ahead of time! Despite that, our server (aka bartender), was so attentive. He kept on refilling our sangria glasses (great sangria btw!) and taking away our dirty plates. The food, although it comes in small portions, was amazing and very filling. It's perfect for sharing. My roommates and I had a little bit of everything that each of us ordered. With so many different flavors, my palette was in heaven :) Definitely recommend to anyone in the mood for some great tapas! (keep in mind though that this place is a little pricey)
