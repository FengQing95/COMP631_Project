Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The waiter comes by and seems perturbed that we don't know what we want as he did come to the table about 2mins after the main body of the party (my friend and her daughter).  We said asked for a few mins and as so much time had passed we got sidetracked about time with conversation, but again the server came to our table 5min after the first time, then told us that the order usually takes 30 min to prepare and get out, after saying this I said oh , is that why you seem so pressed for the order to go in? thanks for the heads up. I order a small cheese pizza  and she orders the chocolate pizza. the Chocolate Pizza is a must have they did a great job, also a cosmo and a dirty martini.
