Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Well it definitely didn't live up to the hype .... I was expecting a lot more . It was busy and packed so I understand if service was slow . Our sever was nice but he forgot to put in our appetizer order . He also forgot about us completely when we told him we needed to pack up the rest of our food and the check .
