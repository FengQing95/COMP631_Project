Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This was my first tapas experience, and I enjoyed it. The server was friendly, and we were seated quickly. I know tapas is not about veggies but I would love to have more options... in any case, I was satisfied with the quality of the dishes I was able to try -- endive salad was awesome! -- and I left surprisingly full.
