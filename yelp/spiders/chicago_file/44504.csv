Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////4. The reason why it goes from 4 to 2 stars: The bf and I ordered a beef empanadas as did two of our other friends.  When the first order came out, we gave it to our friends and we waited.  When we noticed they weren't coming out, we flagged down our server and asked her if there was only one order or two orders of the beef empanadas.  When she told us that there was only one, the bf called out our friends and loudly called them "assholes."  Now, I understand that profanity can be a bit much at dinner, especially if it's said pretty loudly, but the entire restaurant was buzzing and we had to speak a little louder even for regular conversations to be heard.  As soon as the bf called our friends assholes for taking the one order, he quickly ordered another.  As the server was walking away, she gave us the biggest stank eye I've ever received in my adult life and apologized to the table next to us.  Let me repeat that: SHE APOLOGIZED TO THE TABLE NEXT TO US.  Umm, I'm sorry.  Are we children?  Are we not allowed to swear in a public setting?  Even when she apologized, the guy didn't know what she was apologizing for, looked confused and said, "it's okay...?" as she walked away.
