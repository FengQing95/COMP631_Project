Smoque BBQ////I haven't been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here. Â And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals.
