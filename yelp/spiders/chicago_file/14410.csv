Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was in Chicago recently for business and was implored to check out Lou Malanti's, famous for their deep dish Chicago style pizza. Unfortunately I bought into the hype and left underwhelmed. I went for lunch with 2 other coworkers and we each got the personal sized pizza. The service was efficient, albeit very business-like, which is standard fare for the lunch time crowds. Coming from Manhattan, the price was unbelievable. But when it came down to the pizza I felt the crust was too dry and the pizza drenched with too much tomato sauce. I had a tough time locating my sausage topping midst all the sauce.
