Little Goat Diner////So. I appreciate the manager's appropriate attention to detail. And I would like to return at some point to try the food, but will remember to do it when I have no place to be. But the host staff are just outclassed. It just looked like they needed some training before they'll be ready to run a place that's this busy.
