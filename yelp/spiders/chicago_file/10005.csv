Art Institute of Chicago////The special exhibit for Impressionism, Fashion and Modernity was amazing! So many Manet, Monet, Renoir and other pieces right in front of us. Accompanying the art were wonderful period dresses that I heard were even more difficult to put on display due to the fragile nature of the material!
