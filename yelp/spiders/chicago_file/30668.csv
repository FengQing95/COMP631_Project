Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came here on a Thursday night with a party of 5 and we were seated right away. The tables are all seated pretty close together so i didn't really like that. We ordered the spicy wings, calamari, and the Lou (medium size). The wings were realllyyy good! Me and my friends were really blown away by how good it was. It was buffalo sauce but not too tangy and it did have a little bit of a kick of spice! We got the 12 piece and wish we ordered another one! The calamari was disappointing. No flavor or salt and the sauce wasn't good. Now that was too tangy. The Lou was pretty good at first but as i continued to eat it, i got bored of the taste. It was really filling and the server said it was enough to feed 4 people, but we felt it was enough to feed 8! We didn't even finish the pizza and there were 5 of us.
