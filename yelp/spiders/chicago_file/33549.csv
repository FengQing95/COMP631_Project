Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great find..the food, atmosphere, service, decor, all are amazing. Reservations are somewhat difficult to get, but, worth it. The have a full bar and an extensive wine list, both by the bottle and the glass. We ordered the beef stroganoff, the rib-eye with hand cut fries. A side of broccoli, which was grilled to tender perfection. We started with sharing a wedge salad with the best, homemade bacon, blue cheese dressing. The pork belly bacon is worth it alone. The salad was excellent. The beef stroganoff with wild mushrooms and short ribs was also excellent. The rib-eye was cooked to perfection. Serviced with perfectly seasoned fries with a garlic aiolli sauce. The sliced rib-eye was favorable and cooked to perfection. Since it was a Birthday celebration they brought a complementary ice cream sundae with a sparkler. The service with John was excellent. Perfect timing, excellent suggestions made the evening perfect.
