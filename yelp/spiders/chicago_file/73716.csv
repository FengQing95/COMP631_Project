Little Goat Diner////The food was pretty good, as many reviewers have said before me.  We've eaten at Girl and the Goat and loved it, and while this was nowhere near as amazing, it was still pretty good.  Big portions for the price.  We had the bulls eye french toast, which was a good mix of flavors and not overly greasy like your typical chicken and waffles.  Also tried an omelette, which was very good as well but nothing too spectacular.
