Smoque BBQ////My husband and I (he more than I) love BBQ food and have been wanting to try this place for a while. We both had a day off, and went on a Wednesday for lunch. We got there right around opening time, and there were only a couple of people in front of us. We came at a good time because the crowd came more at around 11:30 - many there for take-out rather than eating in. The gentlemen that greeted us at the door let us know to order at the counter and take a seat anywhere. My husband had the baby back ribs with slaw, baked beans, fries, and a taster size pulled pork. I had the sliced brisket platter with slaw, Mac and cheese, and cornbread. We both tried everything. The ribs were excellent, as was the brisket. The pulled pork was a little dry for our taste. The meat is served dry, and you get sides of sauce. Â I liked both. I'd say the beans were our least favorite side, but we really enjoyed the rest. We drove in from The south suburbs just for lunch, and it was well worth it. One of the best BBQ meals we've had in Chicagoland. We'll be back when we can!
