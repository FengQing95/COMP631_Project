Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////came here on a friday night and expected to wait for more than half n hour, but we got seated within 15 mins or so prob because there were only 2 of us.  the service was great here, everyone was friendly.  the pizza were good, but not super delicious maybe because the deep dish pizza was too heavy for me.  but overall, the pizza both deep dish and thin crust was better than the usual pizza.
