Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered the Classic deep dish pizza, and sure enough it did not disappoint! The sauce on the pizza is definitely the star of the show. It was so tasty and it does not compare to anything we have had before. This probably ruined all the other pizza's we'll ever have again to be honest. The only thing that we have had better is the butter crust. It wasn't that great and to that my girlfriend actually didn't want to eat it. It tasted bland but the sauce or some ranch saved it ;)
