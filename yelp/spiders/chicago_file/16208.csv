Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Okay this is Chicago and everyone has their own personal opinions about who has the best pizza in town, and what constitutes 'good' pizza.  I think there are three main categories of pizza, you have the thin stuff, the 'pan' stuff that has some depth, and the 'deep dish' or 'stuffed' pizza that is just massive.  Lou's is hands down the best middle of the road 'pan' style Chicago Pizza.
