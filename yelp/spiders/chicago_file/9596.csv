Art Institute of Chicago////I was fortunate to have two (free) opportunities this week to visit the Institute and having been to this collection many times in the past, I was blown away by the improvements over the past few years. Piano's Modern Wing simply adds an incredible new space to the current gallery setting and moves Chicago ever closer to becoming that Midwest art Mecca...a sure and significant "hadj" for art aficionados.
