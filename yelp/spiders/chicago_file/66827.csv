Little Goat Diner////The night at little goat was just okay. After the night was over no one in our party could figure out what all the fuss is about. This was my second time there...my memory of breakfast was better. The service was lacking...we felt rushed by our server, water was not refilled automatically, a Â $12 drink was barely cold. The restaurant carries our the theme of a dinner. Keep in mind the space is very loud! If you like that then you are in the right place. The food was fine, the pork pancake was tasty but nothing memorable or special. I would not go back and would not recommend for the value for your money and overall experience.
