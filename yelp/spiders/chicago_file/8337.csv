Art Institute of Chicago////You need to have a goal when you visit the Art Institute: there's no way you can cover the entire museum in one go. We took advantage of the free admission between 5pm and 8pm on Thursdays and were stunned by the impressionist collection they have. It seems like an endless string of Monet, van Gogh, Gauguin, Degas, Manet, Sisley, Pissarro, Seurat paintings (and sculptures), just to name a few. We also made sure to pay homage to Grant Wood's "American Gothic".
