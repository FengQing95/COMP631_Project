Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is one of my favorite steak houses in Chicago! It has a speakeasy look to it and a really cool vibe. I took my sister for her birthday and we ordered the Salmon Caesar Salad, Truffle Mac & Cheese, and the Pommes Frites to share. The fries are the same fries & garlic aioli served at Au Cheval. All of the sides were amazing, honestly the best salad, fries, and Mac & cheese I've ever had. As for the steaks, my sister ordered the princess duchess cut filet and it was delicious. I had the Ribeye Steak Frites and I ordered it medium rare but when it arrived it was cold, but I assumed it was because they let it rest before cutting it up. The steak was pretty marbled & still melted in your mouth even though it was cold. In terms of steak I would recommend the filet mignon over the ribeye steak frites. I also had the Bavette's punch and it was both tart & sweet, I would highly recommend trying it. Overall great service & food, I recommend trying their sides and salads as they were my favorite thing there!
