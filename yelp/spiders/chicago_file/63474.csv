Smoque BBQ////Came here on Tuesday night and was lucky that there was hardly any people in line. The guys attending the dining room area were super friendly. Great customer service. I wish I wasn't by myself so I could have tried everything. Had the opportunity to try the Mac & Cheese, Sliced Brisket, Pulled Pork, Corn Bread and Slaw. SERIOUSLY! SOME OF THE BEST BBQ I'VE EVER HAD! And no shame, but I even enjoyed my cold leftovers in my hotel room lol I recommend everything. I wish I could have tried the ribs and cobbler. The BBQ sauces were so delish. They give you two types. This place is everything you imagined would be for the best hole in the wall place you've ever been to is. You gotta try it!
