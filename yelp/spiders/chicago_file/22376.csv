Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Large portions and the service is good. The real innovation here is they'll take your pizza order while you wait for your table, so it's not 90 minutes from getting in line to eating your slice. Wings were quite good. IMO Chicago-style pizza is the most overrated food in America, and this place didn't change my mind. But it's Chicago, you're gonna wind up in a place like this, and if you're here you're gonna be just fine.
