Art Institute of Chicago////The Modern Wing really elevated the status of this museum. Before it was certainly good for education or just appreciating the collections, but now it has a great selection of new and interesting modern pieces that truly love. The Modern Wing is pretty flawless, and combined with the rest of the museum, definitely makes it worth the admission fee.
