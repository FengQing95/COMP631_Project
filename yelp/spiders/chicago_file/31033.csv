Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was the second Chicago style pizza place that I tried on my first visit to Chicago. The place was jam packed when I got there and it had a 45 minute wait. Good thing is that they allow you to order in advance and they text you once your table is ready. This really helps otherwise I would have waited 45 minutes plus another 40 for the pizza to be prepared and baked. Was the pizza worth the wait? Yes and no. The pizza was definitely delicious but I've tried better Chicago style pizza in Los Angeles if you can believe it. (It's called Black Bird. Give them a try if you're ever in LA. You won't be disappointed!)
