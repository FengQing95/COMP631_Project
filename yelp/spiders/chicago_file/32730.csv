Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This was one of the better meals we've had in Chicago this last year, and we already look forward to coming back.  We snagged 2 spots at the bar last night (NYE) around 6:30p and let the very knowledgeable Bartender do his thing.  We started off with the Baked Goat Cheese, then split the 24oz Prime Bone-in Ribeye steak with 2 sides - Elote Style Corn and the Pommes Frites, and then finished with the Chocolate Cream Pie.  Everything was outstanding, the food, the service, the atmosphere - it is worth the higher prices considering the quality and larger portions as well.  We've only been once, but i feel that this is already our favorite Sodikoff spot.
