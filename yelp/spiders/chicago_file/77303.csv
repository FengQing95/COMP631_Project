Little Goat Diner////The patty melts were delicious both the beef and goat patties. The Goat Almighty is really ALMIGHTY. Its a burger made of beef brisket, with a goat patty ( took off the pork) but its too much burger for one person. It all goes together really well but it was just too much for me to handle. But hands down my favorite were the onion rings. The onions are marinated in a dressing and fried to perfection in a tempura batter. Definitely worth getting.
