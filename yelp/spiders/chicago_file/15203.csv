Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Maybe I am just not a Chicago Deep Dish type of guy.  The service was very good, but I don't think the wait is worth it.  We checked in about 7:55 on a Tuesday for a party of 5.  We were seated at ~9:20.  At least we could order the pizza in advance so it was served not too long after we were seated.  Perfectly time after we finished our salad.  I will say I LOVED their Malnati's Salad as did everyone elese in our group.  I had Gino's East during my last visit and I may prefer their Pizza but that is a personal choice and not due to something Lou's did.  I think next time I want pizza in Chicago I am going to try some thin crust Chicago Pizza.  Lou's has a nice crust and can taste the butter.  The sauce is nicely balanced.  They put one big covering of sausage instead of chuncks/crumbles.
