Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food here is very good and the service as well. It's a bit pricey but very good. They are not generous with the tapas portions so if with a larger group expect to order double or triple of everything and a entree for each person to really fill up. Their red sangria is very delicious and if you order a pitcher expect a nice buzz. Some of their other sangrias not as strong. They do have a brunch with a Bloody Mary bar that's amazing. It can get crowded so I would recommend a reservation or atleast call first before heading over for a walk in.
