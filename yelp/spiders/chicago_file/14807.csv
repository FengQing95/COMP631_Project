Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Say whatever about the beer...it washed down some great pizza.  I was starving and these pies surely hit the spot.  The butter crust was amazing and the pizza was well worth the wait (we waited about 20-30 minutes for the two of us, but then again on St. Patty's Day in mid afternoon during March Madness, I'd say it was pretty good, because the line was way longer when we left).  I could see why it was the "original" and one of the hottest venues to come for the deep dish pizza.
