Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I was looking forward to this meal since my friends who've visited raved that this was the best in Chicago.  We had the filet mignon,  22 öz. Ribeye and I had the lambchops.  Overall experience,  I loved the lamb chops. I was cooked right and was very tender.  My kids however did not find it special.  First off, or appointment was for 9:45, moved from 10:30. We got seated initially at a crappy place since we wanted a booth.  You're paying a lot to sit but then after the delayed flight not to mention the extreme cold,  I begrudgingly agreed.  Lo and behold,  the booth beside the crappy table was free. I said I wanted that,  she checked and we sat there.
