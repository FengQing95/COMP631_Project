Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious! Wait time was about 30-40 min but totally worth the wait. Honestly the only bad thing is that the place was packed and loud. Otherwise it's got that warm and cozy pizzaria feel and the servers were super friendly. If in Chicago, it's a must go to!
