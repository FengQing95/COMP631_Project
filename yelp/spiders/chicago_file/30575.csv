Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The cheese is of course of the star of the show here, and there is a lot of it. It's thick and gooey and velvety all at the same time. It's has a nice stretch/pull factor but doesn't cross over into tough or rubbery territory, which is absolutely vital to good deep dish and something that propels this pizza forward.
