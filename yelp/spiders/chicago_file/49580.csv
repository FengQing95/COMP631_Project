Smoque BBQ////OMG, killer mac and cheese, killer pulled pork...totally worth the wait, though if you call ahead for carry-out, you can bypass the line.  If you actually want to eat in the restaurant, it can be kind of a pain, but if you plan ahead it's manageable.  Before I went there, I figured it can't be *that* great if every likes it so much, but it really was, and the authentic smokey (or shall I say smoquey) bbq flavor is tough to beat.   Plus, their sauce is completely amazing.  Definitely check it out!
