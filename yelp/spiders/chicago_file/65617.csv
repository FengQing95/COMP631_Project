Smoque BBQ////While diamonds have the four C's, this has a similar scale: consistency, cut, quality, clarity vs. other BBQ. Years and years of visits and, unbelievably, this is my first review. Consistency - anytime you visit from the time they open til the last hour of the day, you'll get the same quality and fresh off the smoker cue. Cut - each portion is equal and each cut is even never leading you to think you've been shortchanged. Quality - always premium barbeque, moist, flavorful, delicious. Clarity - Smoque is the standard which I judge other Chicago BBQ by.
