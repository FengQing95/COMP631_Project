Little Goat Diner////LOS DROWNED 5/5: Juicy braised beef, Havarti cheese, avocado, pickled veggies and mayo all bundled up in a warm, toasted hoagie roll and Au Jus on the side. Not exaggerating, but it was the best French dip either of us had experienced. I think I liked this sandwich a teeny bit more than my chicken sandwich and that was after some careful speculation. This was one simply more juicy and filled with flavor.
