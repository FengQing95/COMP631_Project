Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My wife and I both have ravenous appetites but portions were so enormous we ended up only being able to consume half our dessert and had enough left of the savories that we had a full dinner's worth today (and everything tasted just as delicious the day after). Not only were we fighting over who received what of the leftovers (as it was all so amazing) we also already have booked a return visit; definitely signs of a fantastic dinner. Most of the food is rich, so this is not a place one would dine at real frequently, but what is nice is the menu is so varied that one can have a blow out meal with a luxurious seafood platter and high end steak worthy of a special occasion or opt for a shaved beef sandwich, short rib stroganoff, meatloaf etc. and have a relatively inexpensive date night (they even have an unusual BYOB policy where there is no corkage provided that you gift a glass of your wine to another table; additionally there is a great cocktail list and vast wine list with options at all price ranges). I look forward to a long relationship with Bavette's Bar & Boeuf and this is clearly the best steakhouse I have frequented both in terms of ambiance and cuisine.
