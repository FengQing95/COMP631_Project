Little Goat Diner////Loved!!  What a fun brunch, the wait was a tad long... but we went into that knowing we'd be in for a long haul.  That is where the coffee bar comes,in handy- to snack on something before you eat. The service was great- and we were able to avoid a community table- a huge plus in my book. We went a little overboard and a brunch for 4 ppl. was about 160.00 but I wouldn't change a thing. I can't I wait to go back.
