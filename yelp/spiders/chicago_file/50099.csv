Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////It's definitely a party place with all the noise and so many people around, but great for a date as well. My favorite is the patio, though. The prices are decent and the food is pretty great. The staff is friendly and accommodating. I just wish they took reservations because they're always crowded. That's a good sign, though.
