Little Goat Diner////I'm honestly EMBARRASSED at how often I've been to Little Goat. This is my go-to spot to bring friends and family who are visiting from out of town and my favorite restaurant in Chicago as a college student looking for a decent meal with a reasonable price attached to it. I've even skipped a morning lecture to meet a friend here for brunch once. I have a Little Goat Photobooth strip on my wall. Once, when I was drunk, I made a 9pm reservation for a table of one on my birthday. Months before my actual birthday.
