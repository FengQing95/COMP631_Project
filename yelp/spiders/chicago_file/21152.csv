Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My father and I got there on a Tuesday night and were told to expect a 15-20 minute wait. Not bad, we figured it represented how good the restaurant was. They asked us to give a phone number and said they would text us when they were ready to seat us, and to place our pizza orders at the counter to expedite our food getting to us when we were seated.
