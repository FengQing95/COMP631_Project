Smoque BBQ////I've tried the chopped & sliced brisket, pulled pork and the texas sausage. The brisket melt-in-your-mouth moist, the pulled pork is juicy and the sausage was pretty flavorful (for the one bite that I manage to steal from the boyfriends plate.. oops). Highly recommend the mac'n'cheese, some of the best I've ever had (and even reheats well.. if you can mange to not eat your entire meal in one sitting). Also had the cornbread, brisket chili, baked beans.. all good.
