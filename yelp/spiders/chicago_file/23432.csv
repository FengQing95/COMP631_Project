Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I started with the Giant calamari served with lemon and marinara with the cake. Marinara so good you could drink it. Then I had the Lou special which I added onions to. This is the best pizza I've ever put in my mouth. It's like making love to your taste buds. Because it was my birthday, they gave me a complementary deep dish chocolate chip cookie with vanilla bean ice cream whipped cream and a cherry on top. I will definitely be back.
