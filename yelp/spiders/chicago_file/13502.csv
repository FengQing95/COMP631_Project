Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When our table was ready she yelled out the front door for my name. The remote buzzer never rang so we were a bit confused. we all walk over and ask but she was long gone.  She had walked all the way to the back and when we look down the room at her, she just waves us in and points to a side room and walks away.  I give the remote to the other hostess and she says "Do you still need a table?"  I just tell her that I think we just got one, but the remote never buzzed.
