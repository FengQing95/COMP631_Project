Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great place! I've been here twice. Last time for my aunt's birthday. This place is great for larger groups, because you get to try more things on the menu this way. We tried the goat cheese (amazing!!), chicken empanada, spicy potatoes (they were not kidding about spicy, but so good), calamari, stuffed mushrooms...and a few more things that I can't even remember at the moment. The food was delicious. Sangria was pretty good. You have to remember that this is a Spanish tapas place, so portions are small so you can share and mix and match your plate. The food came out pretty quickly, unless you order paella. It was a little loud both times I was there and I would recommend calling ahead and getting a reservation, otherwise you might have to wait a while. Or you can sit a the bar if there is a spot.
