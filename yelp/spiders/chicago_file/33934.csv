Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our 2nd time here over the past few months, and once again the food and service were absolutely great.  But once again the host that greeted us upon our arrival seemed indifferent, and on this particular night we had literally climbed over 2 snowbanks to get from the street to the restaurant.  I mentioned this to the host who looked at me like "Yea, ok, whatever", so of course when we left we had to climb back over the snowbanks again!  As we were leaving, I asked how long it could possibly take to clear a path to the street.  Same response.  Very confusing that an exceptional restaurant like this can't follow up on small, but important details like this.
