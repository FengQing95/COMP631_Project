Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza itself was very good.  From what we are told, it's classic Chicago.  I enjoyed the pizza a lot and I'm sure I'll find myself craving it when I'm back in NJ.  Heck, I can always have it shipped back to my house.  This pizza is much different than NJ pizza as you have to eat it with a fork and a knife.  It's almost like a much messier sicilian, because the sauce is on top, whereas with the sicilian the cheese is on top.  The cheese almost glues everything together, in a way.
