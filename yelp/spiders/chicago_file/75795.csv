Little Goat Diner////Guess all the hype from the mother store - "Girl and the Goat" got to me to try little goat and there is no line to grab a bite here. We got a seat right away and near the kitchen where I like to see the real action that prepares everyone dishes. To my surprise that day I actually saw Stephanie in the kitchen (it was a plus to see the owner/celebrity and actually working in the kitchen).
