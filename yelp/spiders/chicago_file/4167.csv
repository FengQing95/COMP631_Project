The Purple Pig////Andi did an excellent job taking care of us. Dishes came out from the kitchen as they were ready, instead of all out at once (Andi asked us what we preferred and we chose the former). A Purple Pig branded glass bottle of water was left at our table so we didn't need to wait for refills on water. All of the staff we interacted with were welcoming and friendly.
