Smoque BBQ////So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that's good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn't the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I'd go again.
