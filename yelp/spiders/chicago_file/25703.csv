Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////"Best Layover Ever" started off here at Malnati's Pizzeria. My wife and I were seated promptly upstairs in their dining area. The place is nice and clean and the atmosphere was exactly what we were hoping for. A lot of people our age were there and grabbing a bite on this Sunday afternoon. We were glancing over the menu, taking our time...waiting...waiting...about 15 minutes went by without anyone coming to our table. Major bummer, cause I was really hungry and I thought they were better than this. Eventually after making an obvious glance at one of the waitresses, she helped us with our drink order and we eventually got our pizza order in as well.
