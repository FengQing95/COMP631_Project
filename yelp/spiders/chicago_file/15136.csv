Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////enjoyed the malnati house salad better than the deep dish pizza. Â it was prolly the best salad of my life but probably not because I say that a lot..but still, croutons were crisp, feta cheese was MMMM and each piece of salad was perfectly drenched in dressing and there was just good proportions of each ingredient.
