The Purple Pig////This spot is amazing! A friend had been before and made us a reservation, I wouldn't otherwise have ever known about this place as it's located inside a larger building off Michigan Ave! A great place to grab lunch or dinner while you shop. The purple pig has Mediterranean small plates - we tried the whipped feta (incredible), corn salad, anchovy bread crumb broccoli (wow!), and salmon and pork tenderloin dishes. Everything was so great! And with those 5 dishes us 5 girls were full! The staff was super friendly and were very cautious with health and safety during these COVID times! I would recommend this place to anyone!
