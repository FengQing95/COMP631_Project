Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is one of my favorite places to go to. It's a great place to meet up with friends and get some drinks. Definitely my go-to for girls nights or a date night. Tapas are good but not always an ample serving for a group.  The highlight of my dinner here has to be the pitcher of sangria.  My favorites tapas: spicy potatoes, chicken croquettes, garlic shrimp, and the goat cheese plate. Truly love this place but often feel rushed for there's always a wait.
