Little Goat Diner////We had a few disappointed team members in our group after this meal but I'll go back this summer once they smooth out the kinks.  My biggest vote is to shave this menu by at least a third...no one in Chicago can successfully be all things to all people!  (You know you're too flexible when I can check all six boxes on Yelp's "Good for which meal(s)?" survey.)
