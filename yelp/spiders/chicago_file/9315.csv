Art Institute of Chicago////As we'd dedicated the day to this museum, we explored a lot more of what they had to offer.   (I) had no idea just how large this museum was... I had assumed it would be about the size of the Musee D'Orsay in Paris.  Wow, was I wrong!  One full day was not nearly adequate.  Despite having wonderfully gracious staff helping us to navigate around the areas closed for remodeling, we found ourselves feeling more and more pressed for time... even with a very efficient visit to the Court Cafe... By the end of the day, we were dragging... and had seen little more than the highlights of this wonderful institution.  This demands a return trip!
