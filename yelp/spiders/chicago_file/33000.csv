Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I would list this as top 1-2 steak house in Chicago and top 5 in the US.  While the atmosphere is on the dark side it has a great vibe and the service is spot on.  Chicago has endless Steakhouse options, I've been to all the best ones new and old.  This should be one of your top choices if you want a fantastic steak.
