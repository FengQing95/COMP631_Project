Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We waited 20 minutes even tho we made a reservation. They were running behind so that part was a little annoying but overall great restaurant. Good atmosphere. Got two pitchers of sangria both were great. Would recommend the bacon wrapped dates! The bar is open seating but if you want a table be sure to make a reservation.
