Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I really like tapas. REALLY like tapas. It's my favorite way to eat because you get to try tons of different menu items instead of just one, and the meal turns out to be a couple of hours long because it all comes out staggered and what's more fun than a couple of sangria-filled hours?
