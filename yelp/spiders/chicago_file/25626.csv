Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Got a classic deep dish pizza, and BBQ chicken salad. Don't trust that you are hungry and can eat a lot pizza. I saw while waiting a couple walked out with a leftover box, handed it over to a young dude waiting to get in, saying they ordered too much and could not finish. Ours was a medium, gosh, it took a great effort to chew down just over half a pie. It was a great pizza, great size and very filling. Not tomato paste, it's crushed tomato and pulling yard long yummy cheese.
