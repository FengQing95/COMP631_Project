Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Date night was a success here! We went in early on a Saturday night@5! Got seated right away and pleasantly served. Our service was timely and our meal was excellent. I was surprised when the influx of patrons went from no one at 5pm to a full house by 6pm and the quality of our service did not change. Our waitress and the bus staff cleaned our plates rapidly and filled our water cups regularly. Our evening was perfection. Â We will be back with friends!
