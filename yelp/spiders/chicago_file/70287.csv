Little Goat Diner////The first time I went, I had the Bull's Eye French Toast. Prime example of why I appreciate this place: its' french toast with an egg cooked right into the toast, with fried chicken and strawberries on top to compliment. You won't find this dish anywhere else. On my last trip, I had the Fat Elvis waffles, which consisted of waffles with bananas, peanut butter butter (you read that correctly), bacon, and syrup. It was the absolute perfect way to rejuvenate after NYE. Both items were outstanding.
