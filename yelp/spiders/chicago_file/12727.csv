Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////i am also reminded of high school when i made scones in my home economics class.  as i added this class late, i got paired with the resident beavis & butthead duo of two stoner metalheads('sup Mark and Ricky?!) with pencil-thin mustaches.  when these cats weren't preoccupied with trying to set the other's textbook on fire or boiling the toilet crystals or debating the merits of Judas Priest's first album, they often contributed to my earnest efforts by fiddling with the oven temperature and telling me i was a dumbass.  i'll leave it to you to decide who was the dumbass(es)(HINT: my SAT score: 1320).   i suspect some divine intervention, but we managed to crank out a batch of these scones and they tasted exactly like the raw ingredients that went in - flour, lard, baking soda, and salt.  ok, we added currants too but they are basically like retarded raisins and added almost nothing to the finished product.
