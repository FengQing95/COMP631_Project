Smoque BBQ////I would say this is the best BBQ in Chicago.. Great Beef Brisket, Mac and Cheese, Peach Cobbler and Fries.. Service is great.. staff always friendly.. and it is BYOB.. not much seating, but we always take ours to go.. that way you don't have to wait in line.. call ahead and do it early as they sometimes run out of ribs..
