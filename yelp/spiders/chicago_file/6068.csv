The Purple Pig////I had to flag him down multiple times to request refills and to send an item back for being too salty. Initially I thought maybe he was just having a bad day until I heard him thoroughly reviewing the menu and specials with a smile to the couple next to us. The food was pretty good overall, but the service ruined it for me.
