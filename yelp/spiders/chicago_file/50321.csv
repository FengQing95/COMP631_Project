Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been coming here for years and I love, love love it.  Of all the tapas bars in the city, I find the food here to be the most consistent and delicious, and the atmosphere the most fun.  Grab a bunch of friends and make a party out of it!  This is a great place for any type of celebration.
