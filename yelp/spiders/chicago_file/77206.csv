Little Goat Diner////This place was very lively. The menu has a lot of interesting choices, but not too many where it's overwhelming. I got the pork belly pancake and it was pretty tasty. It's a savory dish that has a juicy piece of pork on top of a savory pancake, all covered in a type of slaw. It's definitely worth a try. The only down side about this place was that the service wasn't that great. My waitress rarely came by to check on the table/refill beverages. But I saw Â other servers that looked more engaged so I would definitely recommend checking this place out. I would go back and try something different. I don't think you can go wrong with whatever you choose.
