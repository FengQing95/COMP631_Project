Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////On our last day in Chicago we decided to go to this place because it was close to the hotel. so we walked in and we're seated the staff was really nice and we ordered a medium sized deep dish pizza butter crust.we also had tomatoes put on it and garlic put it in it which to me is kind of odd because you would think Pizza would have garlic in there already or whatever.... When the pizza came out the toppings were only about a half inch thick and the crust was a lot higher than all of the toppings which is not what a deep dish pizza is. The taste also wasn't very good.I don't know if it's because of the tomatoes on top but it wasn't very appetizing. We also ordered bruschetta. It's over said I was basically just tomatoes and cheese and it just really wasn't all that good. because it was the last day I really didn't feel like saying that I didn't like it and I didn't want to change I'm pretty sure they would have... but overall it still was a real deep dish pizza that shouldn't have been that hard to understand.
