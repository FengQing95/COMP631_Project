Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Coming from SF/Bay Area I can't help but compare it to Zachary's in Berkeley. To be honest, I'd have to say they are very close and I'd have to call it a draw. I'd say the toppings at Lou's are more fresh and traditional; they have great flavor and the combinations are excellent. However, I'll give Zachary's Crust the edge in terms of flakeiness and flavor.
