Art Institute of Chicago////Fantastic museum! A must see if visiting Chicago. The museum is huge and very diverse, covering everything from American, Asian, African, and European art. The Impressionist paintings are beautiful and there are several Monet and Van Gogh's. The rooms are spacious so everyone has lots of room to spread out. I also found the Native American and South American artifacts fascinating. There is art from many periods from BC to modern. There is a ton of art here so if you like to read the captions, you can be here all day. Not sure if kids will appreciate it as much but otherwise highly recommended.
