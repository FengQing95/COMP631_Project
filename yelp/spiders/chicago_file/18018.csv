Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had a bottle of wine a couple of appetizers and a medium pizza and everything was amazing and delicious. We also had an amazing server that took care of us all the way. Her name was Kristen and she was just amazing always checking up on us and asking if we needed something else. I would definitely recommend the place and If you get Kristen she will take care of you!
