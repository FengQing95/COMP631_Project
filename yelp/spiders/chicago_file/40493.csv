Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The icing on the cake was their carrot cake!! The perfect ending to a wonderful meal! We were all so full but satisfied! I highly recommend visiting this Steakhouse the next time you are craving a melt in your mouth steak, or even delicious fried chicken because they have it and they do it well!!
