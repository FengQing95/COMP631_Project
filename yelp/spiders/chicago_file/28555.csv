Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Definitely felt like this place was overhyped. We went on Super Bowl Sunday and it was empty so it was perfect for us visiting. The crust of the pizza is my favorite part and I disliked this crust so much. I felt like I was eating a bland cracker. We got the original pizza and added pepperoni.
