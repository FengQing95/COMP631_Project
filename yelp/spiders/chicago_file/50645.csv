Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Hands down my favorite restaurant! I love the tapa style and we ordered all the popular dishes on the menu! The burrata, octopus and paella were awesome and we loved the white sangria we well. The paella was very rich and creamy, and the seafood tasted really fresh with a natural sweetness. Pork belly was very crispy and rich, and the potatoes were out of this world! Would definitely recommend if you are looking for Spanish food and family style dining!
