Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////For food, you really can't go wrong on their extensive menu of tapas. I always opt for the bacon wrapped dates which are crispy, sweet, chewy and so yummy.  The Burratta is phenomenal, as is the goat cheese in tomato sauce.  The shrimp with lemon and red pepper is another favorite, as is the brussels sprouts salad which has manchego cheese and a yummy citrus dressing.
