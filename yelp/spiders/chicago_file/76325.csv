Little Goat Diner////I've had this place bookmarked ever since reading Brian K's review & his 10/10 rating for the fat Elvis waffles. Finally came here with a friend- 30min wait for 2 on a Friday at 8pm, compared to 3hrs at Girl & Goat. The place was bustling and a bit loud, but it was still a fun, lively experience.
