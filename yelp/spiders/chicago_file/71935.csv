Little Goat Diner////Ohhh Little Goat. I just think this place tries too hard to be innovative with its food....The menu is diverse and kinda crazy and you get excited. But when it comes it just doesn't match up to your expectations. Unfortunately I have spent the last 3 months living in LA and thanks to that, my expectations are extremely high. Maybe that's why I just didn't like it.
