Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I went to the River North Lou Malnati's for lunch with a group of friends, and we had a good time dining on their deep dish pizza.  It's a casual, family-friendly and group-friendly restaurant to have Chicago deep dish.  I tried the Chicago Classic with green pepper, and it was delicious.  The House Salad is also good, especially Malnati's own sweet vinaigrette dressing.  The ice cream sundae is good too, particularly the vanilla ice cream.  I only wish the brownie included in the sundae was served hot.
