Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Besides our faves of the Brussel Sprout Salad, Fried Calamari and Goat Cheese with garlic bread, we tried a few new items. The Piri-Piri fried chicken thighs were excellent and the Meatballs had a spice like I have never tasted before, so good. We always get the red Sangria(like no other) and this time ended with a Chocolate Truffle for dessert. Everything was awesome!
