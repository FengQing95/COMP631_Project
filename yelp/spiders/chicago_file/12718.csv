Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////we ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic (blend of lean sausage, some extra cheese, and tomato sauce on their butter crust) and we ordered a sausage pizza and added mushrooms, onions, green peppers, garlic, and hot giardiniera.. both were really good and flavorfull! the butter crust on the malnati made the crust more enjoyable to eat.. they also didn't cheap out on the amount of ingredients that they put on the pizza either..
