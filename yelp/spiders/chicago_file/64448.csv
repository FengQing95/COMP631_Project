Smoque BBQ////We came by for a lunch stop at 1:45pm on a Saturday and had a pulled pork sandwich with mac'n cheese, a sliced beef brisket sandwich with peach cobbler, and a 1/4 slab taster portion of the St Louis ribs.  The ribs and pulled pork were like 4 star good, but the beef brisket was out of this world good!  The ribs were just slightly dry, and the comparison was amplified by the juicy and tender brisket.  The brisket looked meaty and hearty, but you could almost have sliced it with a feather, and that's only a slight exaggeration.  Wow!  As some others have said, the beef brisket is the place's signature offering, and I'm in agreement.  The other amazing observation for our second visit here was that for the 45 minutes we were there, the line length just maintained itself from the counter to the door, with a sure and steady flow of incoming customers.  It only took 15 minutes to get to the counter to order as both counter service as well as table service were excellent.   A guy checks with you if you're taking out or eating in, and keeps an eye out for a table opening, which we readily got when our number was called.   Anyway, we'll surely be back to have the brisket again plus the chicken which was also highly recommended to us.
