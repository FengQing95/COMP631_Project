Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Probably one of the best tapas places I've been to in chicago! The ambiance is perfect for both date night, or just a casual meal with friends/family. The staff were extremely welcoming and we were promptly seated. In regards to food, the portion sizes were bigger than I expected for tapas, which was a nice surprise! If you're feeling extra hungry, I would definitely recommend getting the paella as well. The flavor combinations for each dish were unique and complementary and I could tell a lot of effort was put into each one. My only negative would be that the service was extremely slow that evening. Not sure if they were understaffed that day, but our sever was balancing a table of 14 plus 3 other tables in addition to ours, so we ended up waiting a long time in between drink/food/dessert orders. Aside from the wait, the service was exceptional, and we even got a free dessert for the birthday boy! Would definitely recommend checking this place out!
