Smoque BBQ////The chopped brisket was so tender and delicious, no question I will be ordering that next time I go. The fries are very good, fresh cut and hot. The baked beans were also fantastic. I thought the mac & cheese was pretty good, but there were first 2 side were better. (I must admit I went a little overboard ordering 3 sides that day!)
