Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you are coming from out of town and want to eat a real Chicago pizza, this is the one.  I'm tempted to give this place a 5-star rating, but it is not quite as good as it was five years ago.  Maybe it's me.  Whatever, no one should ever rate this place below 4-stars.  It is the most consistent experience in town.
