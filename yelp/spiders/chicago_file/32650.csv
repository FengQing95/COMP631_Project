Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food as always was excellent, but the service was poor.  From the moment we were seated our server was in an obvious huge rush to get us out of there.  We ordered a nice bottle of wine and she checked with us approx 5 times within 10 minutes to order food. So we ordered apps and then dinner, which was out within a couple of minutes while we just started on bread. This after we said we wanted to take our time. Meanwhile our server kept filling our glasses to the top, seemingly to get us to chug our wine down. It was very irritating.  We had 3/4 bottle of wine left when we were finished eating, then immediately on to the dessert menu.  I had to tell her to please keep the bottle on the table.  We dine out frequently including many times at Bavettes and never have I experienced service that was so rushed, almost like it was a race against time.  Especially with an expensive meal.  It was disappointing.
