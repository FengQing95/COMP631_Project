Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our waiter gave us some crap for being "techies" when we told him we were from San Francisco, but we get that stereotype a lot (even though we're not) so we just laughed and shrugged it off. It's a pretty neat spot and a Chicago staple (depending on who you talk to, I suppose), so I personally thought it was worth the wait to experience!
