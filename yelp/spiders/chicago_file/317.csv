Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Delicious food and super quick. We got in just before the rush and were sat immediately. I got the fig and walnut pancakes, hubs got the omelet special. We both licked our plates clean. We considered going back the next day but wanted to get out of town asap. We'll be back!
