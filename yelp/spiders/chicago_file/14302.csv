Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time visiting Chicago, wanted to try deep dish. Choose Lou Mainati's and I am sorry I did so. Got there around 5:30 on a Saturday, there was little wait time. Waitress had a shitty attitude from the get go. Since I am not a meat eater we ordered a veg pie and salad. Choose lemon garlic dressing which was thick mayo based glop that tasted neither like garlic or lemon, brought this to attention of shitty attitude waitress who gave us a hard time and then took a long time to bring us another dressing. On to the pizza, the veggies were tough to find amid a pool of grease, runny cheese and undercooked crust that had the texture of apple pie crust Not pizza crust. Overall I was highly disappointed.
