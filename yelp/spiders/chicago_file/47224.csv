Smoque BBQ////The smell of this place alone gets 5 stars, I just wish it wasn't so middle of nowhere and replaced the so-so smoke shack near my place in LP. I had the brisket and promptly devoured it, the smell and taste had me drooling like Pavlov's dogs. Cole Slaw was so-so, but its cole slaw, and this place is all about the meat. Damn good cornbread too!
