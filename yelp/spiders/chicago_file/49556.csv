Smoque BBQ////This was fantastic BBQ!!! Best I have had I want to say. I got a combo...pulled pork and brisket. I also got a sausage. All was fantastic. Brisket and Pork were amazing. The sauces were also amazing. I was very happy with this place. I am from the south where BBQ is well known and I was amazed at the quality of BBQ in Chicago!!
