Little Goat Diner////After a pre-employment medical screening downtown, I decided that it was time to try a new place. While not too familiar with the area where my physical was being held, I found out the facility was just a short walk from Ogilvie Transportation Center. That being said, I searched Yelp for some Breakfast/Lunch type fare, and Little Goat piqued my interest.
