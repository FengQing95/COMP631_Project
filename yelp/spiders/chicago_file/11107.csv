Art Institute of Chicago////KNOW before you GO: Before you pay for general admission, check with the staff on specials. We went with a combo admission deal of both the Art Institute and the Skydeck which saved us a few $$ on admission for that visit. Also note the rules on photography with cameras and smart phones. They do watch out for that.
