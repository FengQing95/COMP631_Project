Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is outstanding. My wife and I came here on a Saturday night as a fun night out. It was our second time dining at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba and both experiences were excellent. We made a reservation for 7:00 and were seated promptly and 6:55. We tried a number of different tapas, the pintxos board, and a bottle and a half of wine. Everything was delicious. The tapas came out at an appropriate time without over crowding the table or feeling rushed. The food was prepared perfectly and presentation was well thought out. Our waiter, Karl, was fantastic. He was a wealth of knowledge. He was able to assist our decision making when selecting our food choices. His knowledge of wine was that of a sommelier. I highly recommend Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!
