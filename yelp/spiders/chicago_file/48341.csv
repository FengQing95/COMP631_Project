Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////As far as bloodies go, this place is a 10. There's a bloody mary bar with everything you could ever want in a bloody. Peppar Vodka? yep. Three different kinds of tomato juice? yep. Bacon? yep. Shrimp? sure, why not. You literally can't go wrong when you can make it exactly how you like it, just make sure you leave room for everything they have to add to it.
