Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Onto the steaks and sides... We appreciated that the meat was cut off the bone for us already, taking away the only real con of choosing a bone-in steak. The steaks were cooked perfectly to the temperatures we requested. The dry aging gave the steaks a wonderful depth of flavor. For the sides, we got the loaded baked potato and truffle mac and cheese (our waiter's recommendation). To our surprise, we got two baked potatoes! They were just okay, though. They came with bacon on top and shredded cheddar on the side. The bacon was thick and chunky and tasted like a nice ham -- elegant for sure, just not our preferred take on bacon. The truffle mac and cheese was rich and had so much of that luscious cheese sauce. I would order this side again.
