Smoque BBQ////Smoque's hand cut french fries are world class; no need to say more. The baked beans were fair to middlin', the slaw was thin sliced cabbage in a vinegar based sauce with thin slices of a red onion; different and better than a lot of them. Â  The mac-n--cheese was a great choice with a crispy top.
