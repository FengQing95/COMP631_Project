Smoque BBQ////Eh.  That's all I can say.  I was SOOOO excited to try this place.  If I remember correctly, one of the owners took a sabatical and went all around the country finding the best BBQ and taking those recipes and molding it into one.  And I have to say I wasn't that impressed.  Will I go back?  Sure.   But I seriously think all the hype and the crazy long wait to get your food just isn't worth it.
