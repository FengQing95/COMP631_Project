Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of my all time favorite places. Bunch, lunch, happy hour, dinner - it's amazing for any time of day! Have always been able to call ahead for parties of 5+ the same day and get a table. Each dish is amazing but the staple patatas bravas is a frequent order along with the goat cheese in tomato sauce. Sangrias are also phenomenal and you can get such a wide variety. The ambiance is also very warm and homey. Come check it out!!
