The Purple Pig////I'm really disappointed! This place has such GREAT reviews. But - there are so many buts. First was the limited table space as most of the restaurant is shared table seating with other diners. We ordered one cheese and two meats that came with crackers, pickles and almond/honey spread that was just okay - how could you possibly mess up a meat and cheese plate right? My only complaint on the cheese was that the piece of cheese we were served had a side of it that must have been uncovered or something because it was dried out and hard to eat. We ordered seafood saganaki and Â milk braised pork with mashed potatoes for our main meals - both of them were unimpressive and super salty. The toasted bread was the best thing from our main meals. One star for the okay meat and cheese plate, another star for the large wine/beer/liquor menu. Otherwise...it wasn't worth it. At all.
