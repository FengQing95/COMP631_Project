Little Goat Diner////Ignore any star rating less than 5. This place is great. Awesome breakfast, fabulous coffee and their lunch items are amazing. Yes, there might be a wait, but that happens. There is first come first serve at the bar in the back and there always seems to be a seat there. They do have inventive dishes, so don't come in with your own expectations of someone else's creative spin on the flavor. Come in with an open mind and an empty stomach, you will not be disappointed.
