Little Goat Diner////The roof bar was everything you could hope for in a rooftop - comfortable couch seating, bar staff knocking down drinks with the customers, watermelon based booze, and everyone just generally having a great time. It's small, reminds me of a casual summer get together on the roof deck of a condo, but the giant goat reminds that yes, you are at a restaurant by the Top Chef herself.
