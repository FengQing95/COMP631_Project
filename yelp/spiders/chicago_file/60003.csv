Smoque BBQ////I'm a creature of habit and both times I had the pulled pork sandwich platter w/ slaw and two sides.  The pulled pork is very tender and there vinegar based sauce really compliments the pork well.  The fries are solid and the pork & beans are also very good.  Fellow diners have tried the brisket and ribs which were also well received.
