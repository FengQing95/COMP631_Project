Smoque BBQ////Smoque really has the tastiest bbq that I've ever eaten, especially in Chicago. The meat is tender and perfectly seasoned even without the sauce (I've never tried the pork). The sauce just makes it even more heavenly. I always dip my fries in the brisket sauce because its tangy, thick & spicy. They have a new spicy sauce that I don't feel is actually as spicy as the brisket sauce so this is the one that I stick with. My preferred meats are the chopped brisket & both of the ribs, the fries are super crispy, hot & perfect. I'll eat the baked beans (they are awesome) if someone else buys them because I just can't get enough of the fries (I get 2 orders as my sides). I haven't tried the mac n cheese, cornbread or the cobbler. I do not care for the coleslaw :(. Â Smoque is well priced & satisfying; just make sure they haven't run out of your favorite fix or you'll be an angry eater (this happened to me once and I realized I had a serious addiction to this place). I went to Fat Willy's as an alternative and I was not happy.
