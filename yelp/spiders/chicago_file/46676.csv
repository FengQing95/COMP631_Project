Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is sooo good! It's a little expensive but everything is so delicious. The spicy potatoes (not sure what they were called) were soooo good. The dessert were amazing! We got 4 desserts and everything was awesome. Overall awesome experience. I will note that it's extremely busy in there and the tables are pretty close together.
