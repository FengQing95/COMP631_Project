Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I had the LM Classic (large size!)- deep-dish with sausage, pounds of cheese and sauce.  After two slices, I felt my stomach churn the cheese and sauce. My arteries were getting clogged.  "God, please dont let me suffer from cardio-pulmonary arrest after the third slice."  After three slices, my waist grew three inches, but this is damn good pizza and its damn worth it.  I rarely eat pizza, and since I was visiting Chicago from the City of Devils (oh, Angels), I wanted the most fattening, heart-stopping (literally) stuff! You must try the LM Classic Pizza, its rich in cheese, and the sausage is prepared right before each order (according to the server), and the slices are enormous (on a large pizza).
