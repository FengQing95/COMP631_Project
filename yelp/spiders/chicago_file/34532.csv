Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We ate down in the dungeon and the lighting was on the pitch dark side of dim. Our booth was cozy and allowed me to have easy access to my husband's incredible dinner. Everything tasted so good I literally licked the plates.  I had a dry-aged ribeye and he had the pork chop. I can't believe a porkchop could actually taste better than a dryage steak but somehow Bavettes makes the pork taste AHHHMAZING.  The creamed spinach also blew my mind.
