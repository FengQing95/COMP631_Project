Little Goat Diner////I brought my parents here for an early mothers day brunch on a Saturday, so they could experience the goodness and creativity the menu offers. For some reason, the hostess thought it would be a good idea to sit my wife, child and parents and I around a man and his kid sitting next to each other while they eat breakfast. The seating arrangement would have had 2 of us sitting across from these total strangers and facing them, for the duration of our/their meal, while the rest of us sat next to these total strangers....Not really the ideal seating arrangement when taking your parents out to breakfast and catching up. I've experienced communal seating and dining on numerous occasions, but have never been sat at a table that would have resulted in my party essentially encompassing another.
