Smoque BBQ////What was Guy Fieri thinking man? I tried this because I saw the place on "triple D" and it wasn't to far, THANK GOD! I had the brisket and mac and cheese, the brisket was dry and the mac and cheese WTF? I've heard of green bean cassarole with corn bread crumbs on top but never on mac and cheese, it made for a plate of very dry and bland noodles. Where was the cheese? For Guy Fieri to rate the brisket as "some of the best and most tender brisket", "HE LIED"! T he brisket was so over cooked and the spices were damned there N/A. The BBQ sauce was very plain tasting and all thought on the episode i saw the coca-cola thing seemed very intriguing it made for a very tasteless sauce that could have used alot of help from the "SOUTH" Over all I give this pathetic excuse for southern BBQ A zero but they don't have that option on the screen!
