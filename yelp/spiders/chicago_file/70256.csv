Little Goat Diner////Trust me when I say a 5 star rating is sparse for me. This place is one of bests in Chicago. More affordable and tastier than Girl & Goat across the street (owned by the same chef). I've been here 3 times already, once for dinner and twice for breakfast. First visit I got the pork belly pancake. Pretty good. We also ordered the garlic cheese bread (OMG YUM), fries and mac and cheese (also highly recommended).
