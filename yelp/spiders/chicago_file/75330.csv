Little Goat Diner////I am biased because I "heart" Top Chef! This place is fantastic, the Mac n'cheese is delicious. My sister strangely ordered the baked beans, but again awesome! The Tonkatsu, a breaded pork cutlet on white bread (hmm) with Asian BBQ, mayo and cabbage slaw. For me, if something is breaded it doesn't need bread, the cabbage was, I really liked whatever it was marinated in and wish I had had more of that and less mayo/white bread. As for dessert, I tried the smoked pork and toffee milkshake. It was good, I didn't get much pork beyond a salty aftertaste but I like a toffee milk milkshake anytime.
