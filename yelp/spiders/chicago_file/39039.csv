Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We started with old school prohibition style cocktails: Belle Mead Old Fashioneds for my dining companions and a Dark & Stormy for me. No complaints here! Appetizers of the sweetest oysters, crab cake loaded with lump crab and peppered duck pate enhanced with an apricot sauce that were all expertly presented and prepared.
