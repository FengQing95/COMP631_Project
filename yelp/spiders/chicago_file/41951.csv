Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////It seems people run hot and cold on Ba Ba Reeba. Last night was my first time there, and I was cautiously optimistic. I was with a large group, and our table was ready promptly after we arrived. The atmosphere is quite nice, and though it's a little noisy, there are quite a few nooks and crannies that offer a feeling of intimacy.
