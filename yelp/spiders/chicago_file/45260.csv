Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food was delicious.  I have this block in my head that I can never be full from (non-all-you-can-eat) sushi and tapas, but was proved wrong, as I usually am.  Between my friend and I, we had 7 plates and were plenty stuffed by the end.  Everything was cooked really well, our favorite being the incredibly simple yet delightful potatoes with aioli.  Some of the other dishes were a little more on the good, but not super-great side including the shrimp doused in garlicky butter and seared sausage (one of which tasted like a slim-jim)
