Smoque BBQ////Just writing this review makes me want another order of Smoque's baby back ribs.  They were exactly the way I want ribs to be - not falling off the bone like they were done in a slow cooker but smoky, meaty, and requiring some actual teeth to consume.  The sauce was great too, although fans of sweet-style BBQ sauces (like most types of Sweet Baby Ray's, for instance) may be disappointed because the Smoque sauce has a little kick to it and definitely isn't sweet.
