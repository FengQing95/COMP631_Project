Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Did three different restaurants in 3 days. Tried Due then Uno and Malnatis before that.  Each was unique although I ordered similar individual deep dishes. Malnati's was the overall winner for a great crust.  Not too much crust and a good tomato pieced sauce.  Due was bready and Uno was cracker dry and overbaked. Those were a disappointment but their service was faster.  All wait staff was on it.   My one advice for those few fellow anchovy eaters at any of the three is don't bother.    Only a few are added so they really don't add much.
