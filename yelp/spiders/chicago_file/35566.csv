Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Just in case you're one of those "read the first few sentences people," I'm going to start you off by suggesting the ice cream for dessert. It comes with a magic shell-style chocolate hazelnut sauce (dubbed "magic crack sauce" by our table) which really takes it to the next level. Plus they have whiskey flavored ice cream. Excellent.
