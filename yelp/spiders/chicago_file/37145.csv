Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The steaks and roast chicken are some of my favorite menu items. Though, my ideal time spent at Bavette's is at the bar, with a glass of wine, enjoying a slice of their to-die-for lemon meringue pie- crunchy, tart and sweet all at the same time, topped with a pile of meringue, not to miss!
