Little Goat Diner////For dinner I had sunfish which had saut√©ed sunfish, braised goat, over a warm veggie salad drizzled with goat's milk caramel. I had never had sunfish and was curious to try it. It was a light ok fish. The braised goat was obviously the winner of the medley of food in that dish.
