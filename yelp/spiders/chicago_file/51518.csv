Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////After a pitcher of the fantastic berry sangria and many shared plates we were very satisfied with the food and overall experience. And finally the icing on the cake, our server brought out about 7 or 8 of the small desserts for us on the house as well as removing the sangria and a couple of the tapas from our bill to make up for our delay in seating. That was honestly the best customer service and superb recovery I've ever received, they actually care about the customers! So pleased with everything, I will definitely be returning very soon.
