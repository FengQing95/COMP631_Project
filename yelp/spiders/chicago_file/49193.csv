Smoque BBQ////So although I have only had carry out from Smoque, the fact that ever since that day I have been daydreaming about the beef brisket renders it possible for me to give them a 5.  Even the side dishes were phenomenal.  We had some left overs and I tried my best to wait until lunch the next day to eat them, but i only made it to 10:30 A.M.  The bbq sauce was no over powering and had a sweet vinegar taste, without tasting like sloppy joe (how bbq brisket often tastes).  I can't wait to go back!!!
