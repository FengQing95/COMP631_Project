Little Goat Diner////The hostess told us there would be a half hour wait for 2 people when there were not even kidding 8 tables open and 6 open counter seats. We saw her turn away about 4 other parties of 2 insisting there was a wait. We waited for about 15 mins and finally spoke up. She then said "oh well the counter isn't set, I guess I can do it." Like yeah... I guess you can, isn't that part of your job?
