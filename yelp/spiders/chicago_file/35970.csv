Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is the best steakhouse I have ever been to. Everything from the decor and the staff, to food and drinks was perfect. My husband and I started with their famous crab cakes. Neither of us had crab cakes before but the reviews on them were too good to pass up. The reviews were spot on! We really liked them. We each had a filet and shared mashed potatoes. The filet was so tender, you literally did not need a knife. Hands down, the best mashed potatoes I have ever had! Every bite was amazing. We had drinks that were delicious and a server who was so helpful and kind! When I return to Chicago, I will defiantly be back.
