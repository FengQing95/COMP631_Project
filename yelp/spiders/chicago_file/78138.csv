Little Goat Diner////The location is very close to many attractions and great spots. Seeing such a vibrant area and great menu section allows one to expand there taste buds. I ordered the shrimp and grits and was not expecting the taste to be more similar to a soup versus the southern style typical dish. I was not impressed with the service or the wait staff and the demeanor of the place very short and not polite. I would say the pancakes were fantastic and I would order those again but that's about it for the place. I'm sure other items are good on the menu however the shrimp and grits are not your traditional taste on the delicious southern dish.
