Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I am not a fan. The food is super salty and I haven't found one thing that is sooo good, making this establishment stand out. It is super loud inside, so everytime I come, I end up having a raspy voice by the time I leave. I will say their sangria is delicious, but don't let your drunken state allow you to order more sub-par tapas. I always leave dissatisfied.
