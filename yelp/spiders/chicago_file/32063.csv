Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Went here to compare which was best between Giordano's, and I'd have to say this place is better! We got the wings, buffa-Lou and garlic parm style.. can I just say that garlic parmesan sauce is OUT OF THIS WORLD (Especially if you love butter)!? We ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic and added pepperoni and bell peppers.. a small was more than enough for 3 gals eating their way through Chicago! The crust was not too dense, and a perfect level of flakiness. Service was good and it wasn't too crowded around lunch time on a Friday. Will definitely recommend to any friends traveling to Chicago!
