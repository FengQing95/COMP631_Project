Art Institute of Chicago////YOU MUST COME HERE!!! I was blown away by the enormity of the museum. There are so many exhibits and collections. I saw Rothko, Monet, Warhol, Van Gogh, Picasso, the list goes on and on. Â If you are looking for a particular piece make sure to ask one of the volunteers for the best route to view it. Don't forget to check out the skybridge on the way out.
