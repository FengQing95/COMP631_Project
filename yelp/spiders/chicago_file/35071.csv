Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This was my first night in my new city, and everyone I met said that this was the place to go for a great dinner. Boy were they right. I didn't make a reservation but ate at a bar table. From the drinks to the service everything was great! I may not be as savy as my coworkers yet but I know good when I taste or drink it.
