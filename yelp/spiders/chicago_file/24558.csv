Lou Malnati's Pizzeria//// My boyfriend and I ordered a glass of wine each and decided to split an order of fried cheddar cheese balls, on my request. They came out nice and warm served with marina sauce, and they were very good! A good option other than just motz sticks. We ordered our pizza, a small deep dish with sausage, onion, spinach, garlic, basil and tomato sauce. It came out fresh out of the oven and was sliced right at our table and plopped hot and oozing with cheese onto our plates for us! If this wasn't Chicago style deep dish then I don't know what is? This pizza was so good and very flavorful. I'm a crust lover and boy did their buttercrust make me happy. Crunch and semi salty and butter, couldn't have been better!
