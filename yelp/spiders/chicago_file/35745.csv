Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Of course opinions are subjective, but mine is that Bavette's is the perfect restaurant for a nice night out. Their menu is concisely filled out with simple yet surprisingly memorable dishes. They bake their own sourdough that San Francisco can't touch. They cure their own thick cut bacon that would make Farmer John faint.
