Art Institute of Chicago////I'm so glad we chose (at the last minute) to visit The Art Institute of Chicago. What a treasure!!! The museum is filled with excellent artwork on display in a beautiful and accessible setting. Unlike many museums, The Art Institute of Chicago is small enough to visit in a day (or less). Plus there are classic paintings around every corner. I can't believe we saw all of these works in just a few short hours!
