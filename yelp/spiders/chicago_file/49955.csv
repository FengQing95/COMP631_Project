Smoque BBQ////Best BBQ I have ever had!  I don't even know where to begin.  I am picky as all hell when it comes to meat so lets begin there...the sliced beef brisket, pulled pork sandwiches, and baby back ribs are for lack of a better word, flawless!  It's rare when you can rely on a single place to make all these cuts having all the desirable qualities you are looking for in authentic barbeque.  From my understanding, they slow smoke with an applewood and oakwood mix for upwards of 15 hours.  And their Memphis style barbeque sauce perfectly compliments these cuts.  The brisket is moist and flavorful.  The pulled pork sandwiches use a brioche-like bun that doesn't overpower the flavor of the meat.  And the baby back ribs are done correctly.  I hate eating ribs that fall right off the bone like gelatin.  The ribs here have the perfect consistency which is a testament to the quality and attention to detail of their smoking process.
