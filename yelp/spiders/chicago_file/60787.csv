Smoque BBQ////I like that the ribs are mostly just dry rub and they provide you the sauce on the side.  I sometimes hate places that douse them with sauce (though I can think of some places that do it this way and it's really good...).  They give you two different kinds of sauce, I don't really remember the difference but one I liked and one I didn't like at all.
