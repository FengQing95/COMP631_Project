Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If this review was about the pizza alone, it would be a 5-star review without a doubt.  However, I sadly have to dock Lou Malnati's 1-star due to their service.  It was my first time in Chicago and since I had limited time out here due to business, I decided to hit up all the touristy areas first.  My friend that lives in Chicago recommended Lou Malnati's for the best deep dish pizza in town, so I decided to head out here on a Wednesday night.
