Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////That short-rib stuffed pepper - oh my! And the scallops. I was with a group of 4 and sampled many delicious items. I think you are safe ordering anything here. The place was crowded. We were lucky to get seated relatively quickly. I recommend a reservation. Go hungry and take your time!
