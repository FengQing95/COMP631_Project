Lou Malnati's Pizzeria//// Service was indifferent - not bad but certainly not good.  The the crust of the thin-crust pizza was very good. We ordered one thin and one pan (or deep dish not sure what they call it) along with two salads.  Unfortunately the crust on the pan was soggy and disappointing.
