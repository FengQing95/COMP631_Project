Smoque BBQ////This Irving Park bbq does a brisk lunch business.  You may feel a bit corralled waiting in line to order during peak hours.  You seat yourself after ordering, like at a fast food restaurant, and the seating is no more comfortable.  Good value, and large menu, though some side dishes are more successful than others.
