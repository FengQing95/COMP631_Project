The Purple Pig////I thoroughly enjoyed my meal here, and glad we came at an off time where it wasn't too crowded. It had rained the previous day, so it was nice and sunny the day we went, came around 4pm so we beat the dinner crowd. The food and presentation was definitely a delight to the eyes. And service was prompt and friendly.
