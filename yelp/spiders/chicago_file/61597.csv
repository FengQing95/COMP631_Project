Smoque BBQ////Overall, the experience was great. The atmosphere was really comfortable and the restaurant had a lot of character and life to it. The service was great despite it being extremely busy. Definitely not the place to go if you want fine dining because it's more of a cross between fast food and dining. Really cannot emphasize how great the food was.
