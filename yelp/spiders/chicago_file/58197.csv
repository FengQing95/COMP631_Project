Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love tapas. I am not a person who like to order massive meal in restaurant and just eat it to be full. Me and my boyfriend went there yesterday and the place is awesome. I'm glad I made reservation because it was packed! Pitcher of sangria is something you want to start with. Bread is out of this world, I am from Europe and was missing normal bread in US but this one brought me to the other continent. Many great options in the menu, and prices are very very reasonable. Will definitely come back!
