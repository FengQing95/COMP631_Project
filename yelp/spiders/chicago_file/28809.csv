Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Once the pizzas (finally) arrived, we were all happy. I ordered an individual size cheese with spinach and green pepper. I ate half and was full but not stuffed. My coworkers shared a 2 person pizza which ended up being 4 slices total. They were pleased with their selection as well.
