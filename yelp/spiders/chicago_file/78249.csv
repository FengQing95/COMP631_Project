Little Goat Diner////This is a fantastic restaurant. It's super busy yet very efficient. I had "This little Piggy went to China" which was amazing with the flavors; gooseberries such a great addition. My waiter Jonny made me feel like I was a regular in a small neighborhood diner instead of a large city with his attentive service. Will be back!
