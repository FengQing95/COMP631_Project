Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here for dinner with some friends. We had a reservation which I think was necessary because it was so crowded. The restaurant is surprisingly really large. I love the patio area because it's sunny and bright. We got the pitcher of red sangria for our drinks. It's actually a really big pitcher and totally worth it if everyone is getting sangria (compared to each getting individual drinks).
