Smoque BBQ////I think Smoque is the best BBQ in Chicago.  We tried the Ribs (Baby Back and St. Louis) Pulled Pork, Briskett, Beans, Fries, and Cole Slaw.  Loved the Baby Back Ribs, didn't care for the St. Louis Style.  Loved the briskett, fries were good, beans were good, and the cole slaw was not good.  Great sauce and amazing flavor on the meat.  Went between meals around 2:30 and only had a few in front of us in line.
