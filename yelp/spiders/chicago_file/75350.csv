Little Goat Diner////Made reservations and got there on time. I saw some people who got seated before we did and arrived after us when they didn't have reservations so that was not so cool. Any way after about fifteen minutes we got seated and our server greeted us and offer us drinks while we decided on the food. The food was good and dessert was awesome. The place it self looks nice. Might come back
