Little Goat Diner////The Grilled Cheese was good, but I've had better. It was super flavorful but was missing the cheese overload I was looking for (I really like cheese, hence the cheese fries earlier). If you're meh on cheese, this might be the right one for you. My husband ordered the Okonomiyaki and liked it, but I'm not sure that is what he actually ate. The man next to me ordered the same thing and it looked similar to my husbands meal but not the same ( I wasn't able to give a full inspection as I'd have liked as the man seemed apprehensive about me staring at his food).  His had meat on it. My husband's had no meat but had an egg on it.  Not sure which one was correct, but whatever he ate, it was good.
