Smoque BBQ////I'll preface this review witha couple of facts about myself:  I was born in Houston, TX and lived between there and Dallas, TX until I was 16 at which point my family moved to Charlotte, NC where I stayed until age 21.  I went to college in Wilmington, NC (far east NC) and lived there for 11 years.  My younger brother and his family live in Savannah, GA.  My father was on a BBQ team in TX for years before I was born and several years after.  I know BBQ.
