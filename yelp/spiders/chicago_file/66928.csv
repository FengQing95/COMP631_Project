Little Goat Diner////I'm giving a 2 star review b/c I experienced sub-par service, although the food was good.  My friend and I had a lunch reservation.  We arrived a few minutes before our reservation and checked in with the hostess.  She said it would be a few minutes.  Fine. 10 minutes later I went back to check with her, and I said, you know we did have a reservation at 1PM.  Her response was "well a lot of people have a reservation at that time).  Um, ok.  She didn't even offer or suggest that we go next door to the bakery/bar to get a drink while we were waiting (I had dined at Little Goat before but without a reservation, and the hostess at that time offered up the bakery, so I thought it was rude that this particular hostess did not, especially since we did have a reservation).  Ultimately we were seated literally half an hour past our reservation time, without any sort of apology or acknowledgement.  I understand that sometimes you get jammed up and people stay longer than you might anticipate, but I find it very rude to not acknowledge or apologize for that, as it inconvenienced my friend and I.
