Little Goat Diner////I've been here almost every week and have to say  today may have been an off day?? Came here for breakfast and the place wasn't even packed. Took 20 minutes for our food to be served and everything was underwhelming. Ordered the paratha burrito( dry and had wilted greens on top that looked like they were sitting under the warmer for an extended period of time) cauliflower bi bim bop (yolks were over cooked) and corned beef hash (very little corned beef that was overcooked and hash browns tasted as if it had been left over from the night before).  Didn't want to write a negative review but there should be more quality control from the kitchen before the food is delivered to the table.
