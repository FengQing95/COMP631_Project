Little Goat Diner////Great little diner for a casual weekend breakfast! I had the shrimp and cheesy grits, and they did not disappoint. We had a 9:45 reservation, but had we not come in with the reservation we probably only would have waited 20-30 minutes; Not a bad wait for a Saturday morning. Prices are moderate - Expect to spend $10-20 per person. We will definitely be taking friends and family here when they come visit from out of town!
