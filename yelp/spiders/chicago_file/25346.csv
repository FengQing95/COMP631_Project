Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ordered Lou's through Grub Hub and was surprised when our order didn't take forever to arrive at the hotel we were staying at. It came early, still hot and the ice cream wasn't melted. I am always hesitant ordering for delivery but this location didn't disappoint. Props to being earlier than the arrival time given to us.
