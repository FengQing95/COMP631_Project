Art Institute of Chicago////Update 11/8/07:  Came for Free Thursday night and it was great! Free hot drinks, an all-you-can-eat candy buffet with a stunning view of the skyline, and some wonderful special exhibits. I liked the giant aerial photos of water, sand, and lonely people in  Richard Misrach: On the Beach.  The Jasper Johns Gray exhibit was also more interesting than I expected, because the the lack of color made me focus on his techniques and textures.
