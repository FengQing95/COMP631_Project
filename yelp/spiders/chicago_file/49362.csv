Smoque BBQ////Damn that Brisket was great, I gave it an B+ :) mac and cheese good B+ :) baked beans good B+ :) corn bread was good as well. they didn't have much on their liquid  selection. I didn't care for the coleslaw :( it had way too much vinegar and onion.  I also didn't care for be set up as far as how are you order and pick up, when you dine-in. it's a very small place for the magnitude of customers, looking forward to hopefully them opening up a bigger location.  Overall yes I  give Smoque 4 $tars :) I definitely would recommend and return  myself.
