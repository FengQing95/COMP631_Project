The Purple Pig////LOVED IT!! The reviews and hype or all true! We stumbled upon this place on a Tuesday night. No wait (as I have heard there are long waits to get in here) and great service. It was somewhat cold when we came but there is a seating arrangement outdoors under a covered tent (I am sure they take this down during the summer) looking towards the river and Michigan Ave. Everything on the menu is wine, swine and cheese. Not the place for the touchy stomach :)
