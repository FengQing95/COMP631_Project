Smoque BBQ////I stopped in on Saturday for a late second lunch, with Michael K., Janice K., her sister, and her sister's roommate.  The place was neither full nor empty at 4 in the afternoon - we enjoyed our food in good company, but without an attendant wait.  I liked the casual bare bones feel of the place.  It felt welcoming in a neighborhood lunch stop kind of way.  We ordered at the counter and took our place at a communal table.  The cashier was pleasant enough, and the food came out fast.
