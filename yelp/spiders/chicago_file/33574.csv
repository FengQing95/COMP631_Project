Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I love the corkage fee  "share a glass with another patron, at another table". how fun and creative is that.  brought two bottles to have with our dinner and was happy to share.  started with marrow, its probalby the best marrow I have had.  then we split a crab avocado sald, equally yummy but filling.... uh oh. split a steak but I couldnt even finish the  half a steak.  seasoned just rigth too.  loved it all.  and of course YOU  MUST DO THE WHISKEY ICE CREAM. that was over the top!  service was spot on, the whole experiences was top notch and I would def go again.
