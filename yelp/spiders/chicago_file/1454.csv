Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This place is okay.  The berry bliss pancakes were a little too much for me with all that weird fake fruity sauce and I don't even really remember what my boyfriend got.  Our server was extremely nice though :)  All in all it was an okay experience, I definitely don't think it is worth waiting 30 minutes for a table here.
