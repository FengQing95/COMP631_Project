Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I totally understand the hype surrounding this place. My husband and I are on a cross country road trip and we knew we needed to stop and try true Chicago deep dish pizza. We were not at all disappointed! We got half of the Lou's and half of the Malnati's classic. Both were excellent, but the classic had the most delicious sausage I've ever had on a pizza! This was definitely worth the trip!
