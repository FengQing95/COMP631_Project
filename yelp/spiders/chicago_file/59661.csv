Smoque BBQ////The ribs are second to none. I prefer the smokier St. Louis ribs to the more traditional Baby Back, but to each his or her own. Why argue when you can just do half a slab of each anyways? The brisket, pulled pork, and chicken are all awesome too with the chicken being a real standout to me. Usually chicken at a BBQ place is either super dry or mad greasy. Smoque's is just moist and flavorful. I don't remember the names of the sauces, but there are two main ones which really go well with the meat they are intended for.
