Smoque BBQ////This place is great all the way around. I must admit that it looked like a cluster f**k when I walked in the door but after observing for a few moments I realized the staff had everything under control. So don't get intimidated by a large crowd you will get a seat by time your food is ready. Chopped brisket sandwich was perfect as well as the pulled pork sandwich.
