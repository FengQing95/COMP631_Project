Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great scene, and surprisingly even better food.  In my experience the two don't usually go hand in hand.  A friend and I went after work for a quick drink and to share a few items.The whitefish caesar was incredible, the burger very good. Also drinks were creative without being trendy.  Anxious to go back and have the full dining experience.
