Little Goat Diner////On another ocassion I was able to try the shrimp and cheese grits and the chicken and waffles. Both were really good, with flavors that were unexpected in a very good way. I have also been to Little Goat for lunch, I had braised beef sandwich and my friend had the ruben. My braised beef sandwhich was decent, nothing to write home about and unfortuntely my freind did not like the ruben, she said it was dry, the meat looked dry to me.
