Smoque BBQ////I've only had the brisket, and honestly, I have no interested in trying anything else.  It is DIVINE.  I do recommend going on weeknights, and, while BYOB is great, the dining area is a shame.    What reviewer mentioned prison cafeteria?  I second that emotion.  Congrats to the owners!
