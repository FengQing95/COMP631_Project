Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Before you even walk through the front door, you can smell all the delicious food from down the street. There is a wait, but it's not bad at all. Mine was 20 minutes. It's also expected for a place as good as this. The food is delicious, the staff is extremely friendly and the service is excellent. What a great way to wake up in Chicago.
