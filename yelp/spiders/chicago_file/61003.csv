Smoque BBQ////Next to mine, surely the best BBQ in Chicago.  Up there with anything anywhere.   I eat at BBQ joints wherever I travel.   We shared the brisket, pulled pork and St. Louis ribs.   They were all cooked and smoked to absolute perfection.  Perfectly tender and moist with just enough tug to keep it together.   The sauces were good.  The service was fast.  Inside and outside seating.  Looks like they do a brisk takeout business also.  Highly recommend.
