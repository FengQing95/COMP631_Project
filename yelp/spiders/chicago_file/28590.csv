Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So, I think it comes down to this for me... Giordano's has thicker cheese and thicker and softer crust. If you like less cheese you'll probably prefer Lou's if you like lots of cheese you'll probably like Giordano's better. In my experience, Giordano's also has more sauce on their pizza...so if you love or hate sauce, that could make a difference too.
