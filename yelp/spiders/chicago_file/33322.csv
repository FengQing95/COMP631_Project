Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I went here for my fiance's birthday, it is his favorite restaurant and our experience here the year before was great.  This time it was not as great.  We had an 8:45 reservation on a Monday night.  I had called earlier in the week to see if we could come in closer to 8:00 because 8:45 was a little late for us, the person on the other end of the phone basically laughed at me and said they would call if something opened up.  Nothing opened up.  We arrived for our 8:45 reservation and were told they were really busy and they could not seat us yet.  We ended up waiting, in a group of many others, for about 20 minutes. Normally I wouldn't have a problem waiting 20 minutes, but it was already 8:45 on a Monday, and this is an expensive restaurant, I was not mentally prepared to wait.  For appetizers we had shrimp cocktail and a crab cake.  The shrimp cocktail was amazing and I don't even like shrimp.  The crab cake was over-seasoned with either too much lemon or lime.  For dinner we both had petite filets.  I ordered mine medium and it came medium rare so I did not eat the extra bloody parts.  I should have sent the steak back, but by that time it was nearly 10:00 and I did not feel like extending the dinner any longer.  My fiance's steak was good.  For sides we had mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese and bacon, all were very good.  So in sum, the food was mostly good the service was not the best given how expensive this restaurant is and compared to other comparably priced restaurants in Chicago.
