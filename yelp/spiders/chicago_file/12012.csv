Art Institute of Chicago////The lions at the front are so iconic and so lovely. Buy tickets online and make it so you don't have to waste precious time in line standing there to go in. Also, wear comfy shoes. This place is big and it is for real. Stone floors everywhere. 3 floors and dozens of art rooms. Do not come unprepared.
