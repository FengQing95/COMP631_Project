Art Institute of Chicago////This place has been reviewed enough, but I just want to point out the new modern wing was worth the price of admission. I loved seeing pieces by Mondrian, Warhol, Ellsworth Kelly, Jasper Johns, Hockney, Rothko, de Kooning and of course Picasso. Very well done and a beautiful museum to visit.
