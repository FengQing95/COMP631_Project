Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Anyways, the food was perfectly fine, but the price-per-portion ratio was high enough that you'd want the food to be exceptional, not just good. Nothing was remotely bad, but a lot of the food just didn't taste especially fresh and the flavors were a bit muted, which was disappointing for the price point. I probably wouldn't go again.
