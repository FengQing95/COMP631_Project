Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Good food at a decent price. The pizza was good but not great. I love sausage but I must be used to sausage being sprinkled on the pizza in places instead of a pizza sized sausage on my pizza. Still good though. I love all kinds of pizza but I might be more of a thin crust dork.
