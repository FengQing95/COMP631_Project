Little Goat Diner////So why not "five stars"...well, because I'm not THAT disrupted! There's more to it than just the eats...I think there's a case of excess of demand here that's hurting a bit. I waited over 20 minutes on a Friday afternoon. The hostess desk wasn't as "top notch" as the original resto.  My tempura mashed potatoes took too long to arrive and were not quite warm when they did. The kitchen did remake them completely even though I only asked for a warm-up. My server was a doll and working so hard to keep up. I could see that tables around me were waiting a long time for their food as well.  I think these kinks will be worked out in time.
