Little Goat Diner////Had the opportunity to go to dinner here with some friends and I'm not sure what the hype is about this place.  The food is well made but nothing wowing, ambiance is nice albeit extremely loud (maybe the loudest restaurant I've ever been to), and the service is brisk.  What this restaurant gets right is the overall vibe of being casual food but in an upscale venue that makes it fun for groups.
