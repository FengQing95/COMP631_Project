Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great cocktails, nice wine list, tasty food, what's not to like?  The Bacon Roasted Tomato Salad combines two of the best side items - homemade bacon and roasted tomatoes - to create a starting dish well worthy for a great meal.  I presume if you're coming here you're not a vegetarian but if so you'll still enjoy the tomatoes.  My bartender recommended the Shaved Prime Beef Sandwich for dinner which was pretty much spot-on.  Didn't need the au jus, just great beef on what appeared to be a long ciabatta roll and it came with really good homemade chips for $18 total.  The cocktails were well made, service was friendly, and the food was excellent.  I think I'll have to head back when I'm in Chicago for my next visit, it was that good.
