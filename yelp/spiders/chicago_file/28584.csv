Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////On my last trip out to Chicago I was lucky enough to try the big three of deep dish pies and must admit that Lou Malnati's was a serious contender to Giordano's while Pizzeria Uno was a distant third. Malnati's has a polished if not expected touristic feel to it but the staff is friendly enough and considering each pie takes 45 minutes to fire, they do a good job of keeping the masses flowing. Their menu is extensive but my play was the obvious: I am here for the Pizza and Pizza only.
