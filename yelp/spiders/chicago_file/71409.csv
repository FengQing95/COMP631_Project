Little Goat Diner////The music and the decor are awesome. Its got that old timey diner vibe, but with exquisite fixtures, and very hip. I love that there are single bathrooms in the back (but more than one for women & men) Its also very comfy. I can see coming here when you need a pick-me-up, or for a celebration. We were here for my dad's birthday.
