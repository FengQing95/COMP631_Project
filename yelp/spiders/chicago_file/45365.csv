Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////On the negative side, the stuffed mushrooms tasted like they came out of a box and the paella was missing the great crust that paella's are known for. I've learned not to compare American tapas with Spanish tapas since they are unique in their own way, but for American tapas in Chicago, Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is a great place to go.
