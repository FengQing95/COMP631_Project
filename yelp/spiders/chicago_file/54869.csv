Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is one of my favorite spots in Chicago. Food is always outstanding, exciting, the atmosphere is lively and comfortable at the same time. This is a spot that has become a Mecca of sorts when a good friend comes into town. Is no longer a question of where to go, we just know this restaurant is the place to go.
