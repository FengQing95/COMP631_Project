Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you are in chicago and wana have best deep dish pizza, this is famous but not really worth of hype, waiting an hour is fine but understandable, we ordered the classic well done but turned out very hard bread crust, too much of marinana sauce and tomatoes which overpowered the rest of the veggies or meat ( too tangy ), cheese was ordinary, chicken turkey sausage was good... but the soul of pizza which was the pizza sauce , it was let down.. hence scoring it 2 of 5..
