Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Not the best tapas I've had, but not the worst either. I came here for brunch a few weeks ago and left satisfied. Sometimes the pacing of tapas can be off, but this was on point and well spaced out. The sauce that comes with the patatas bravas will have you hoping for more. I did have a minor discrepancy with my credit card bill after the fact, but the manager resolved the issue quickly and explained that the waitress had made an honest mistake. I wouldn't go out of my way to return, but would definitely go back if invited by a friend.
