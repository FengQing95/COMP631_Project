Little Goat Diner////I love the atmosphere in the diner...homestyle chic.  Comfy modern vintage vibe, in line with the other establishments in the W Loop.  Ample room in our booth (near the front of the restaurant, behind the hostess stand), corner wall windows let plenty of natural light in, I like that the kitchen and line are in view.  Community tables had ample space too...and the noise level all around was contained.
