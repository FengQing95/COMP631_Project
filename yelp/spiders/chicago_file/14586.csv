Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I know this will sound odd since we ate here, but we're not really fans of deep dish pizza.  But we were with a group, and you know how it goes.  So we were very pleasantly surprised with this pizza.  This deep dish we like and actually crave.  I cannot quite put my finger on why Lou's is different, but i think they are not quite as deep and cheesy as others, so there is more substance.  But it does not matter -- just try this place.  We really appreciate being able to order while waiting so that the pizza bakes while you wait.
