Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered the spinach salad, calamari, and the Malnati Chicago Classic (small); this was enough for the 3 of us. The salad was average. THE CALAMARI THO. Perfect amount of crispy breading and it was not chewy/rubbery at all. I would come back just for the calamari. The crust of the pizza was delicious, but the whole pizza itself, meh, it was alright.
