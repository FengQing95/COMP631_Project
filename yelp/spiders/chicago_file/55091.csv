Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Café Ba-Ba-Reeba is a Spanish restaurant so the way to go is to order a bunch of tapas(small plates) and split amongst the table. We had 4 fat boys and 2skinny guys who could all eat so we tried so much that I forgot half of what I ate.  I do remember really liking the waffle battered chicken sticks, the Beef tenderloin on English muffin with poached egg and Hollandaise(I didn't share this), the chicken and charizo skewers and the hanger steak with roasted garlic and pearl onions.  The onions were unreal delicious by themselves!  The food prices are very affordable making it easy to order a ton of food.
