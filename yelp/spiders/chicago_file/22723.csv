Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We visited Chicago for the first time and stayed at the Hyatt Regency. After freezing at Wrigley Field we really wanted pizza delivery. First time having deep dish pizza so we thought it was great! We don't have anything to compare it to. Very fresh tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese. We got the large pizza and side salad which was fantastic too. Delivery time was as told to us on the yelp app. We are used to thin NYC crust so we didn't really you can only really eat max 2 slices pp. delivery was a major bonus.
