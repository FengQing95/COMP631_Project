Smoque BBQ////Been here many times and love it. Get here early to avoid a long wait. Went to Smokin Woodys yesterday and I have to say it came nowhere near Smoques quality!!! I could go on an on here but I'll just say try it-you won't be disappointed. And oh-all you people complaining and saying the food was better in Kansas City-----go back to Kansas City so the line will be shorter at Smoque!!!
