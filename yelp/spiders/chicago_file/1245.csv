Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Perfect breezy morning today spent outside at Wildnerry Cafe. Awesome coffee, delicious Belgian waffle (very light rather than a brick) and sausages, large portions (not always a plus, though I do feel better about myself when I can't clean my plate :). Hubby had a build your own omelette that he said was "fluffy and loaded." Done in a pan-bake style, not flipped--delicious. He did finish his, but we're good til dinner now.
