Art Institute of Chicago////We started in the ancient civilization section and walked a historical timeline as we started in Egypt, the land of the Pyramids. Then we worked our way into the Greek and Roman Civilizations. The "ARTifacts" were diverse and reflective of the history of these great civilizations. Where this museum truly shines is in the environment for learning that the Institute offers to the visitors. The ancient art was presented in an open airy environment with plenty of natural light cascading to illuminate the great men and women and their creations. There was a feeling of grandeur. Many works had an IPAD where the viewer could tap the screen to learn about the specific work, see videos of the artistic technique in the creation, learn about the function of the artwork and learn about the history of the time period. Of course, someone more old school could read descriptions on the wall.
