Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////One of the best meals ive ever had is the steak frites here. The bearnaise sauce is the best ive ever had. Fries hand cut cooked to a golden brown. I think the fries were served with a romesco sauce. Also delicious. Steak perfect medium rare. Bartender suggested a great red wine paring. Chocolate cream pie was worth every calorie and cent. If youre looking for great steak this is the place to go.
