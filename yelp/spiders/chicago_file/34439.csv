Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Mains: I ordered the steak frites and my date had the salmon. Both were delectable. I ordered the steak medium-rare, as recommended by the waitress, and was not disappointed. Great cut of steak with minimal seasoning (how I prefer it). The fries were also awesome-- crunchy and seasoned (but not overly). Came with some creamy dipping sauce. The salmon had a great crust to it, just crispy enough and cooked perfectly (the kind where it melts in your mouth).
