Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Seldom does a new dining spot exceed expectations.  Bavettes however does.  The atmosphere gets an A+ with the low lighting, wood, and leather booths. It optimizes the use of the old repurposed building.  The upstairs has a turn of the century look and the downstairs lounge looks like it came straight off the Orient Express. I had the duck and goat cheese appetizer and the smoked fish salad. They were both outstanding. The service was perfect with no glitches. One of the staff took the time to give me  a tour of the place. I am a big fan of Maudes, Gilt Bar, and Au Cheval.  Bavettes could easily be my new favorite.
