Little Goat Diner////Came for brunch and have to say this was one of the best meals during my trip in Chicago. Highly recommend, although you'll have to put up with quite the wait (~45 min in our experience) on a weekend, even around 1 pm. There is a bakery next door if you want to wait while having a cup of coffee.
