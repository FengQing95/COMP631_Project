Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is phenomenal and let me begin by saying that I will certainly go back.  This is the newest place by the same chef that is responsible for Au Cheval, Maude's, and Gilt Bar, all worth going to.  It is a great dining experience from the moment you walk into the door.
