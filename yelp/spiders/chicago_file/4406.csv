The Purple Pig////They were great! Just not 3hr great and definitely not I have to stand only to eat this great. I kept scoping out the seating bar area and saw that there were literally people standing behind the poor folks who were eating waiting to take their space. I don't know about the average person but that would definitely make me feel unwelcome at best and unable to enjoy my meal if I had someone staring at me waiting for me to finish.
