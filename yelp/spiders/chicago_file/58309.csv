Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I'm gonna start by saying this has been my favorite restaurant for 12 years. But recently they have changed the pitcher size for sangria. The full pitcher looks like the half pitcher and the half pitcher looks like a big glass super disappointed and feeling like they are trying to get over on ppl.
