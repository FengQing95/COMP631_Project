Smoque BBQ////Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It's incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn't overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce.
