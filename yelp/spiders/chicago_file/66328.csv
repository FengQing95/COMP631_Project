Little Goat Diner////One of my FAV so far for brunch. Sure the line is super long and it takes forever to get seated, but I don't mind. The place is super cute and witty. I loved all the signs and the boxed water! The bloody mary was also yummy to sip on while you wait. OH and the chocolate chunk cookies are a must, Cookie Monster would so approve!! They are SOOO yummy and the best ever, they melt in your hands, mouth, and every where else, but it's so worth it! BEST cookie ever! If it weren't for the lines, I'd def go more often because the dishes are unique and non brunch conforming. Now I just frequent there for the chocolate chunk cookies - in and out.
