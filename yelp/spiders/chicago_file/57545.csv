Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My friend let them know ahead of time that I was vegan, and they made a totally separate vegan menu for me, including an amazing vegetable pallela, an incredible chickpea dish, and dessert. All of the dishes were on par with the non-vegan dishes, and some even tastier according to my friends. Overall very pleasantly surprised, really appreciate how much effort they put into not only making vegan options, but making them with as much concern for taste and quality as their other dishes. Now they just need to have a permanent vegan menu available! :)
