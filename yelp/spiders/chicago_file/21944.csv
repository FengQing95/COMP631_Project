Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First off, I do like Lou Malnati's pizza.  However, I find the service at this location to be lacking.  As usual, when traveling to Chicago for business, I get seated in the smallest corner seat they have.  I get that they want to save better tables for larger groups who will buy more.  But this place wasn't busy.  Anyway, par for the course and it just isn't this place.  So, on this trip I ordered a beer, a small house salad, and a personal size deep dish pizza.  Items are usually delivered by runners and not your actual server.  It took forever to get my beer.  When it arrived, it was in a dirty glass, but the kid dropped it off and split.  So, I was stuck with it. Next, the salad arrived.  I waited so long, I wanted another beer.  The delivery person dropped off the salad and split, so, there was no chance to place an order.   The house salad dressing, which is a red wine vinaigrette, is really good and a favorite of mine.  Unfortunately, my salad had a hair in it.  I will give them the benefit of the doubt on that one.  After all, I guess it could have been mine.  Besides, there was no one around to tell about it anyway.  Since the wait took so long for the salad and beer, I figured I better get another beer in the works when my pizza arrived (or on the slim chance that my waitress came to check on me).  Well, that second beer arrived AFTER I ate my pizza.  I really didn't need it at that point.  Oh well.  As always, the pizza was good.  For whatever reason, the personal size seems lacking.  Perhaps, it is because you are immediately disappointed when it is eaten so quickly.  More than likely, it is because the recipe just wasn't designed for this size.  Do yourself a favor and get a small (or larger).  You will be happy you have leftovers.  Despite the fact that many describe the crust as buttery and they have something called Buttercrust, supposedly the deep dish dough does not actually contain dairy.  As such, the deep dish is vegan friendly, and I hope this is true, if you order your pizza sans cheese.  Doing just that on this visit, I opted for no cheese and hot giardiniera as a topping.  It is the perfect topping when in Chicago.
