Little Goat Diner////-The place is often very crowded. We came on a Monday night and were told there was a wait for a table unless we wanted to sit at the counter. I found this to be a slightly dubious claim, but didn't feel like arguing. We ended up getting a seat by the bakery area where the seats are first come, first serve.
