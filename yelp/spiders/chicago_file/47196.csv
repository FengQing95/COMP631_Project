Smoque BBQ////This place rules. If you like BBQ go here, you will not be disappointed. I had the brisket platter with slaw, beans, mac n cheese, corn bread, peach cobbler. Everything was excellent. Will definitely be back and recommend to others. Absolutely outstanding! The line was out the door but that is always a sign of something good. Go here!
