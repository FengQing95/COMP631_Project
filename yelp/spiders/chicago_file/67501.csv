Little Goat Diner////The food here is pretty good, but the atmosphere is very much a hipster crowd. The breakfast menu is a bit limited. However if you want a diner brunch or breakfast, this is not the place. If you want a trendy place to eat good food, not a bad choice in a nice location. One warning, the staff is a bit brusk, but given how busy they are, that is understandable.
