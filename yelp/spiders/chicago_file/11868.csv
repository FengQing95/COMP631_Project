Art Institute of Chicago////I spent more than two glorious hours wandering the Institute during a recent business trip to Chicago, and could easily have stayed an hour more. There are far too many highlights to mention, but if time is pressing, head straight for the second floor Impressionist wing, where you'll be greeted by works by Monet, Degas, and other masters. Seurat's Â massive 'Sunday on Le Grande Jatte' is the centerpiece here, but every gallery is packed with treasures that would make an art student blush. From Van Gogh's 'Self Portrait' to Renoir's 'Sisters on a Terrace', the Institute whisks you on an unparalleled sojourn through European painting and sculpture. Few other American museums can boast an Impressionist collection this good - it rivals both New York's Met and the Smithsonian's National Gallery for scope and scale.
