Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I picto tapas bar by myself when I was visiting. It was very crowded on the workday night. I absolutely loved the food I got. It almost felt like the tapas I got in Barcelona. The food was not too spicy but flavorful. Some certain food can get similar and little bit boring for taste. You should check the menu and try to get diverse flavors. I love the atmosphere at night. - I wish it could get more space at the bar.
