Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////In standard Sodikoff fashion, you'll be immersed in a completely new environment; this one is particularly classic and intimate. On this occasion, the service was excellent - incredibly friendly on a personable level and very helpful with our biggest debate of the night - foie gras terrine or salmon tartare. His pro-tip (which I fully back): order the foie gras terrine, save some, and spread it over your steak. Decadence.
