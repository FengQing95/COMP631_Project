Art Institute of Chicago////I love it because there is such a diverse collection.  Ranging from Asian, African, Impressionism/Post-Impressionism (Gauguin and Toulouse-Lautrec are my faves!), to contemporary and knights in shining armor.  There are new exhibits coming in and out of the museum, it's hard to get bored.  Unlike museums like the Uffizi-I mean it's a cool place but after  looking at about a million paintings with the word 'Annunciation, Magi or Madonna' in the title, it gets a little redundant.
