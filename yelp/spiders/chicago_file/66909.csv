Little Goat Diner////The service is slow, the place is loud and there seems to be a lot of people who work there walking around doing nothing but all is forgiven because of the fantastic vegan menu. When we arrived at the last minute (intended to go with the family to Wishbone but it is closed for dinner on Sundays) I was surprised when they asked if we needed "regular menus". Turns out they have a gluten free menu, a dairy free menu and vegan menu in addition to their regular menu. I ordered three things from the vegan menu was impressed by everything I ate and can't wait to go back and try everything else. Kid friendly too (although out of 6 entree orders the last to arrive, by quite a bit, was from the kid's menu for a 2 year old. Bring his out first. There were tears). With a kid's menu, crayons and special cups with lids. They also have high chairs and booster chairs. After a visit to Dillman's long ago I don't take that for granted. I'll be back to Little Goat for sure.
