Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It was very good, but not the best steak or meal I ever had to be worthy of its 5 star reputation and #2 in Chicago Trip Advisor rating. Â They had great oysters, some of the best I ever had. They had an awesome drink menu, certainly good place for drinks. Their service was great. The ambiance is dark and romantic, with good ol' boy decor and classic touches. Very Chi-town. Their sides are delicious, like the Elote corn. Very good. Their steak was great, but nothing that special. I was not blown away by the food. I liked it and was glad we came, but for the hefty price tag I wonder if there are actually better steaks in Chicago. The dessert wasn't amazing either. It was good, but I guess given the rating, the reviews and the price I expected a lot more.
