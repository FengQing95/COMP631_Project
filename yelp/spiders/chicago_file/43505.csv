Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The reason I give this three stars is because I didn't feel like I was eating Spanish food. Maybe this is my own fault; should I have ordered different dishes? I've had tapas before, and while I was pleased, I was left wanting, too. But I will definitely eat here again and give it another shot.
