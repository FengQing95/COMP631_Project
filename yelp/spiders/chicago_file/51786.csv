Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I had a good evening here for a special occasion. The service was good and efficient. Our server was very charming. My issue was with the food and atmosphere, which wasn't terrible, but was fairly boring with poorly executed elements of some dishes. Notably a weird peanut sauce that was not only not flavorful, but also had the unappetizing consistency of grainy paste. Another green sauce (the piri piri I believe) also paste-like and grainy, at least had a bit more flavor. Every other dish was predictable. Every combination felt like the obvious choice.
