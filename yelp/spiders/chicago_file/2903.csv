The Purple Pig////The wait was going to be an hour and half but the bar had open seats so we decided to eat at the bar. My boyfriend and I decided to come here for our date night and I must say that the food here was delicious! We ordered Pork Belly, Bone Marrow, Bavette Steak, and Octopus! Everything was super yummy. I can't wait to go back for the Pork Belly and Bone marrow
