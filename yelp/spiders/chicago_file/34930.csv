Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Just had dinner there on st Patrick's day, really liked the place a lot. My wife had a filet,  I had the bone in rib eye.. we both  had the bearnaise sauce which was wonderful. We also had the garlic mashed potatoes which were outstanding. My rib eye was good, but not quite up to my standards. I ordered medium rare, but it was overcooked so it had lost its tenderness. $70.00 should get me a better tasting and properly cooked steak. I will say the staff was outstanding though, everything about the place was great. I would give it a higher rating if they hadn't overcooked my rib eye. Ill give them another chance someday to cook a steak properly, but for the time being I'm still looking for a steak that's meets my high standards. I've been to a number of Chicago steakhouses, this ranks maybe 4th.
