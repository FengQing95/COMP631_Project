Little Goat Diner////When I have friends in town we go to little goat for brunch. Their tempura mashed potatoes are a must! Don't be scared to try their eclectic creations...they are delicious. the servers always are great at directing you towards something for your palette. if you are vegetarian, let them know. their cocktails are fantastic!!!
