Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////True to their word around 45 minutes after our order was placed our pizza arrived.  I have to say after eating this pizza I would not recommend it to anyone.  The pizza is made in layers.  Starting from the crust, followed by cheese, then a layer of sausage (I'll get to that in a minute) and then the sauce.  The crust is extremely delicious, and they use a high quality cheese.  The sausage on the other hand was pretty much like a gigantic sausage patty that covered the entire pizza.  It was fairly tough to cut through, though it wasn't overly chewy.  All in all it detracted more from the pizza than it added.  Luckily because it was a continuous piece of meat it was extremely easy to slide it off the pizza.  The only drawback was that because the sauce was on top of the sausage I had to scrape it off and add it back to the pizza.  Once I performed this minor surgery it was probably one of the best pizzas I had ever eaten.
