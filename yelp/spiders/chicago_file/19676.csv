Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm not a true deep dish lover, and Lou's was never my favorite. With that being said, they are consistent and reasonably priced when it comes to the Chicago deep dish game. Their beer selection is lacking, and if you want something besides pizza, I would consider going elsewhere. I've grown to appreciate their pizza. Therefore, I would recommend Lou's to new comers.
