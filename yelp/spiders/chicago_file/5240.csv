The Purple Pig////Our first course that arrived was the Whipped Feta. Not knowing what exactly would show up at our table, it was a beautiful display of complex flavors, which included four pillows of light tasty feta, topped by wild greens, which was a wonderful addition for texture, and drops of puréed dates.  The entire appetizer ("Snack") was wonderful and beautifully presented.
