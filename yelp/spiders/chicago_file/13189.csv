Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I know, I know what you're going to say: How can you go to Chicago without trying deep dish pizza?! Well I must confess I have never been a big cheese kinda of guy and therefore pizza has never really been at the top of my list of foods. But with so many people telling us to try somewhere we buckled and chose Lou's based on other Yelp reviews and the top deep dish pizzas on a Thrillist list. We went pretty early in the day and we were seated immediately. I ordered a sausage thin crust and my wife got the personal sausage deep dish. This pizza was different than anything else I have had. The deep dish butter crust was so good, and the cheese was just an amazing ratio. I pretty much ate half my wife's pizza and then 3/4s of mine (I had to share). Truth be told I think there was more cheese on my pizza then the deep dish. I think Lou's was fantastic. I'm told that really only tourist go there, last I checked though good pizza is good pizza
