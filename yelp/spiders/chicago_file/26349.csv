Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We took a city tour where our guide dissed Lou's and said this other place by the Willis tower was the best in town (don't remember the name now, sorry).  After we visited the tower (tip: go there early to avoid huge lines!), we stopped by for a drink, and the place was not that busy, and the deep dish looked so so.  I suspect that our tour guide was getting a kickback to plug the place to visitors.
