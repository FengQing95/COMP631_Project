Little Goat Diner////The actually building that houses Little Goat is adorable - with special adorable points given to the cute cute spinning 3D goat sign on top of the place. And the inside is bright and airy with an enormous copper-beamed skylight in the middle and big communal tables and a lovely counter bar that features those sexy Edison bulbs in big glass domes overhead. It's well designed and for a place that manages to squeeze a LOT of people inside it - it doesn't feel cramped.
