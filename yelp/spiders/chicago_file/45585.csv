Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This restaurant came highly recommended to me by a friend who, by his own admission, "isn't really into food" (What!!) I was skeptical, but after a visit there, I have to say say these are the best tapas I've had in Chicago!  Everything is carefully prepared, the portions are surprisingly large (between two people, we couldn't finish 5 dishes), and the prices are beyond reasonable.
