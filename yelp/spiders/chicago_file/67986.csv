Little Goat Diner////Since its opening, I've been to the restaurant at least 6-7 times for dinner, lunch and brunch. In the process, I've tried several of the main stays on the menu in addition to the seasonal items and variations--I feel confident that I have a good grasp of the menu as a result. To be fair, there are always one or two stand-out dishes or drinks, but the overall dining experience is consistently flat, even mediocre.
