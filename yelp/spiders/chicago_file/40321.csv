Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Okay, by far my favorite steak house in Chicago. The ambiance is sexy and romantic. The service is outstanding. SHOUT OUT TO OUR SERVER JOHN! He truly made our dinner outstanding and went above and beyond to make us comfortable. He knew the menu without hesitation and gave us fantastic recommendations. We ordered The crab cakes, the bone in ribeye, elote, Brussels sprouts and Mac n cheese. I can't tell which one was my favorite because it was all so delicious. Will definitely come back!
