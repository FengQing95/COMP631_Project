Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After about a 40 min wait, we sat down and had our signature pizza with added spinach, as it seemed too meaty without something green. The pizza came around 10-15 minutes after we sat down (you can put in your order while you wait for your table so you don't have to wait 30+ min after you sit down, and the restaurant times your order with the availability of a table) and o.m.g. it was AMAZING. Super cheesy and super topped with tomato sauce, but full of flavor and really hit the spot after a whole day of walking around Chicago and being a tourist. Super filling though and slightly hard to cut. This is the one pizza that requires utensils to eat.
