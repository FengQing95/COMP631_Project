Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've been to Chicago dozens of times, and I've eaten deep dish pizza, but I'd never had deep dish in Chicago. A crime, I know. On a winter visit to Chicago my boyfriend and I decided to right this wrong and check out Lou Malnati's for a late lunch. We sadly had just missed their wonderful-sounding lunch special and thus opted to split a medium Malnati Chicago Classic - sausage, extra cheese, and tomato sauce on their signature butter crust.
