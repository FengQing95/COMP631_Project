Art Institute of Chicago////One of my favorite things is the pile of candy in the modern wing.  You may think, "how stupid.  It's just candy."  Read the plaque.  I won't give it away, but I will tell you that it is a very moving, emotional, well-intentioned exhibit.  And you get to take a piece of candy.  Be respectful and don't throw your wrapper on the floor either!
