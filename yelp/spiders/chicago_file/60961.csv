Smoque BBQ////The meat is all very moist and wet tasting and all, but almost completely devoid of seasoning or meaty flavor. Could be beef. Or pork. Maybe chickenish? The "peach cobbler" needs to change its name to "peach crisp" with a quickness, or else one of these days somebody's moms is going to whoop someone's ass up in there on principle - oats and nuts and shit do not a cobbler make, but the mini cupcake tin of it tasted pretty okay. But it's still not cobbler. I had to track down some Tabasco to liven up the weak sauces. Fries are really really great. Coleslaw is not. Â I like the kids' menu.
