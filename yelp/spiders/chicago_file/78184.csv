Little Goat Diner////CRISPY CREOLE CHICKEN SAMMIE 5/5: I don't even know where to begin. Hands down the BEST fried chicken sandwich I've ever had. It wasn't spicy, so I'll reserve that title for a hot fried chicken spot, but man was it savory. The Creole spices, the slaw, even the hint of olive that I tasted in the tartar sauce....I was blown away by how much attention to detail could be spent on a chicken sandwich. The meat was tender, juicy and delicious with every bite. The entire sandwich was pretty big and would have been easy to share especially since we weren't starving that night...but then we got to the beef sandwich that my boyfriend ordered.
