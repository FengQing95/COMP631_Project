Little Goat Diner////The menu is a twist on classic American food; it's the grub at your favorite 24-hour diner, except that most of the offerings contain pork belly, kimchi, or (of course) some kind of goat product. We split a smorgasbord of food. Biscuit and gravy is a winner; towering, airy, just-buttery-enough biscuit topped with a sumptuous saucy gravy. Hash browns are grated finely and mixed with nuggets of creamy goat cheese. Mac and cheese is very rich, with a crispy top as it ought to have. Both breakfast food offerings we sampled were divine; the kimchee, bacon and egg pancake is the most inventive iteration of the "grand slam" style breakfast I've ever seen (which is not to say that it resembles anything you would try at Denny's), and the pork belly pancake is a more refined version of the street offerings I enjoyed in Bangkok; can't say I know of many diners that crank out scallion pancakes. In my mind, however, the show stealers were the burgers and sandwiches. Sloppy goat sandwich has the same homey flavors of an all-day cooked Italian potroast; slimy, yet satisfying. Burgers are offered permutation style; diners choose between Â goat, beef, turkey, or veggie patties, with a variety of topping combinations; we opted for goat korean style (kimchi, bacon, egg on a squash roll) and beef "wing" style (buffalo sauce, bleu cheese, celery, onion on potato roll). While I can't include these in my burger ranking calculus just yet (as we ordered them medium to assuage our large crowd), I suspect that they'll be in my upper echelon, despite my preference for spartan patties. The meat is moist and cooked to order, the buns are among the best I've tried, and the accoutrements, while whimsical, do not distract from the meat, but enhance it. Desserts range from childhood classics (cookie pie) to truly off the wall (smoked pork and toffee crunch milkshake). All of them are decadent and beyond worth the calories. Drink menu is short but sweet, with 15 excellent beers on tap, including a sumptuous red ale that Haymarket whipped up just for Little Goat. As if it needed another plus, the coffee bar makes the meanest macchiato I've ever enjoyed stateside.
