Smoque BBQ////This place is always super crowded no matter what time you arrive here. The BBQ here is Southern Style with a New Orleans twist. The sauces are tangy, sweet and/or hot, but they are definitely off the chain! I always order either their fall off the bone ribs and/or their brisket sandwich.  The sides are very small and more appropriate for a 3 or 4 year old child. Their price point is moderate, but not super inexpensive. This is one of my favorite BBQ joints in the city.  The service is well organized and the super long lines move relatively quickly.  This is a hole-in-wall type of place.  Have you heard of "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives"?  The Triple "D" show with Guy Fieri?  I would describe this restaurant as a "Dive" Diner. It is very small and tables are close together. There is outdoor seating during the summer months (albeit a small one). The main attraction at this "Dive" is the food. Go here for an early lunch and skip all the crazy long lines at dinner time. Once I went here at 8 pm and it was super crowded even late in the evening. Parking can be a bit challenging, but it is free street parking only. I give the food four stars. The customer service gets three stars. Although this is one of my favorite BBQ joint, I sometimes think it is over-rated. I have tried to figure out what is "unique" about their BBQ compared to other BBQ restaurants in the city -- I can't come up with anything!  This is a place where one stands in a long line, order your food at the counter, pay for your food, THEY TELL YOU WHERE TO SIT, wait for your number to be called (listen hard because it gets very, very loud in this place) and pick up your food and beverages. They accept major credit cards and/or cash.
