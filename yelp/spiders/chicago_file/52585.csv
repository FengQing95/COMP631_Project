Smoque BBQ////Anyway, the man was seated at our table, and he didn't like being so close to John's daughters (he may have noticed that they were sick, but I think this really had to do with them being playful- still, they were pretty quiet and didn't make contact with anyone). The final straw came when John was helping a guy bus our area. A napkin fell on the man (it landed by his hands), and he could barely restrain himself (the napkin, by the way, hadn't been used). Anyway, John and I knew that it was "time to go" (I'm sorry, but I hope his food gave the man the runs).
