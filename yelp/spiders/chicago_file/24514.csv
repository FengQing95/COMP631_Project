Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is one of my new favorites for Chicago pizza. I've never tried anything but Pizza but its never let me down. Keep in mind, this pizza is SUPER FILLING. I find that we order 1/2 of what we would elsewhere. If you get extra sausage, know you're getting a manhole-cover size disc of sausage over your entire pizza. Two pieces and you will be stuffed!
