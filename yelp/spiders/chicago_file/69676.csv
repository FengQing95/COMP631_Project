Little Goat Diner////Although there may be a 20 to 45 minute wait for brunch, it is well worth it.  The food is fantastic!  It's a diner version of the "Girl and the Goat," which is across the street.  Also, while you wait, you can drink at the back bar if you'd like.  The bartenders in the back and the wait staff in the restaurant are warm and fun.  Try it!
