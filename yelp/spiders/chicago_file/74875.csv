Little Goat Diner////I came here for Mothers Day with my family. It was 10 of us. I loved the menu!!! So many choice that we couldn't decide. So we ordered a bunch of items and shared. Everything was good in its own right. The best thing was the pork belly pancakes. So good!!! I highly recommend trying this restaurant
