Little Goat Diner////Fairly average cuisine - probably my least favorite of Chef Izard's restaurants in the area (Duck Duck Goat is by far the best).  Most of the items on the menu are very heavy - best advice is to share the dishes and don't over order.  The drinks and coffee are good.  Outdoor seating is nice.
