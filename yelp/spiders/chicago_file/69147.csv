Little Goat Diner////Went here last summer and it was all it was built up to be. We had the Crab Dip, Mac & Cheese, Los Drowned sandwich, and BBQ Pork sandwich. All of it was wonderful, especially Los Drowned, which I believe is one of their more popular sandwiches. Really want to come back and try the brunch as that menu looked ridiculously good.
