Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Recently, I found out that besides Chicago/ Illinois, there is only one other city/ state that has the pleasure of having a Lou Malnati's in the U.S. ... and that is Phoenix, AZ. Living in Las Vegas, I was ecstatic! It is about a 4-5 hour drive or I have the option on taking that hour flight. Will try to make it a point to visit at least every other month LoL Yes, all for this. Best pizza I've ever had! That's because I've yet been to NYC or Boston. But who knows if they can slug out Lou's and Chicago in general to take the crown as best pizza? We shall see.. it's a personal preference anyway.
