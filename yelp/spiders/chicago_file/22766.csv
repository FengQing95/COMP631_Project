Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I wanted to love this place so bad. I've heard about it for years and is supposed to be one of the chicago style deep dish titans! I finally get to Chicago a couple days ago and try some really good restaurants and today was pizza. Finally decided to get the famous lou malnatis. I typically don't give reviews unless the food is great, but this is different. The pizza I received had zero flavor. Not even a pinch of salt. Maybe its me and maybe im crazy, so maybe go try it for yourself? I personally wouldn't recommend it but maybeeeee youll like it. The buttercrust had good texture/crisp with no flavor. Similar to a frozen pizza taste. Hopefully the other places in the city are better. I hate to get this bad review because I was excited to try this, but I am left disappointed. Again maybe I am crazy but this was my experience. You could love it. Who knows? 1 star for crust texture.
