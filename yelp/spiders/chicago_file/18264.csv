Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The wait is something you must factor in. And if you get there in the wrong 15 minute block the line is insane. They must print money. The pizza coming from a New Yorker was average. I heard there's spots Chicagoans go to that's not this spot. This is more of a tourist spot. Wife and I wasn't mad we went but wouldn't go back. You won't be mad but it has to be a better spot that reps Chicago.
