Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The sangria here was good, but the tapas themselves were just ok. The place had a fun atmosphere and it was nice that we got in on a Friday night without a reservation. The service was also good. The reason for the 3 stars Â is that the tapas could be better, but it was affordable and I may try it again.
