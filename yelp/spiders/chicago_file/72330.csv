Little Goat Diner////Service: holy balls it has the most impeccable service I've seen anywhere other than at a fine dining restaurant.  Friends and I were running low on crackers for our crab dip.  Server notices it literally from across the room, grabs the crackers from the kitchen, and brings them our way.  It's AWESOME knowing that the servers are always keeping an eye on you, even when they're away from your table!
