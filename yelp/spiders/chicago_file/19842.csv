Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Giordano's was a great pizza. It wasn't as good as Lou's but it was still really good. The crust is thick and a dominant feature in the pizza. It was very flaky. I liked having the butter crust from Lou's more. The cheese was good but it wasn't as succulent as Lou's. I will say, that Giordano's had better sauce. It was really sweet and tasty. I thought it was a great flavor for pizza. The service was really good but it didn't stand out like the service did at Lou's.
