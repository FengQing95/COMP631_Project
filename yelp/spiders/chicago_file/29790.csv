Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I brought my wife and daughter here on Thursday night. They wanted to know what all the hype was about. After we put our name on the list, we only waited about 40 minutes to be seated. Shortly after, my family knew what the hype was about. Lou's simply has the best Chicago Style pizza in all the land! They have a first rate staff and service. The pizza speaks for itself! You can have all the other pizza joints. Lou Malnati's wins hands down every time in my book!
