Little Goat Diner////I tried the kimchee / bacon / eggs / pancakes Asian style breakfast tasty thing - and no I didn't forget the name of the dish, that's what it's called, and it's fantastic. It's a play on okonomiyaki - a savory Japanese pancake / street food. The combination of the crisp bacon, the soft eggs, the slight doughiness of the pancake and the tangy kimchee and ponzu style sauce was superb. Other than that, we got to try the breakfast spaghetti with clams 'n crab. This dish wasn't quite as enjoyable as the "Japanese pancakes", it was just a little too rich for so early in the morning. But throw a runny egg over clam/crab pasta with parmesan, pork, and bok choy any other time of the day - and I'm in. Aside from the fact that we were slightly caught off guard by the richness - this dish was great as well. Speaking of rich, the last dish we got to try was the brandade and belly. As the theme goes with the rest of the menu - there was no shortage of flavor in this dish either. Everything we tried was great, just don't expect to go run a marathon after eating here.
