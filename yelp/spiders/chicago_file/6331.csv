The Purple Pig////My group shared three dishes: Chicken and Waffles, Avocado Toast, and French omelette. The omelette was expected, but excellent. A solid dish! The surprise was the Avocado Toast Â which was a guacamole with the acid coming from the olives and cucumbers. It was a weird combo, but it worked! The chicken and waffles were the best I've ever had! The waffle was more savory than sweet which I loved. The chicken was pretty epic too!
