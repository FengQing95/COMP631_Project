Little Goat Diner////If sloppy joes made with Manwich sauce make you smile with nostalgia, hurry to Little Goat Diner. Just off the plane, I savored views of the river and stunning architecture during my 2 mile walk to the restaurant. I joined nearly two dozen diners experiencing a mid-afternoon meal (2:30 pm) under the skylit ceiling with an occasional glimpse into the open kitchen. Torn between 75 options from breakfast indulgences, burgers & sandwiches to dishes that blurred the lines between AM and PM (e.g. Breakfast spaghetti 'n clams n' crab), I took a risk. Go simple and hope for spectacular.
