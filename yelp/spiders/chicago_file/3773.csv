The Purple Pig////Food & Drink: After looking around the menu, talking to the friendly bartenders, and checking out yelp I decided to get the Brussels sprouts and the pork shoulder. It was such a pleasant surprise. The pork was so tender and the flavors were so delicious. I had a refreshing Paloma to compliment my meal. I definitely need to come back with friends so I can try a variety of dishes
