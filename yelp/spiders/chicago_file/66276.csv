Little Goat Diner////Waited over 75 Minutes to be sat but luckily I had Donny as a bartender in the Bread Bar, who had made my wait feel like a breeze or was it the "morning shots" or the amazing mimosa drinks that he had made us. Thanks Donny. When it was time to be sat the host tried to sit us at the diner table with stools against the wall. There was no way I was going to wait 75 minutes for a stool so I "politely" asked for a table and within 5 minutes I was sat at a table. Perfect. I really can't remember our waitresses name due the long wait and mass amounts of drinks but then again you all probably make more money off drinks then actual food. I had the Sloppy Goat which was amazing since I never had goat before. I will be back one Sunday in the future to try something else on your menu and to obviously see Donny. Shot out to Sarelle as well.. hopefully that's her name. ____ girl wasted. Laugh. Love the people that work here. It should be the "Brunch" place of the year.. #GreatAtmosphere. #Amazing
