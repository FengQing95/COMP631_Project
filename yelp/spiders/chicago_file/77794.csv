Little Goat Diner////After pouring over the menu, I finally settled upon Bull's Eye French Toast.  Admittedly, I'm new to the whole non-scrambled egg life.  I'm dipping my toe into the gooey pool.  So far, so good.  So, out comes my almost inch thick onion brioche bread with a soft, gooey egg baked in the middle of each slice.  Note: the bread isn't super high on the onion flavor, think of it more like well-seasoned.  The fried chicken on top was fantastic and just the right amount.  The strawberries were an unexpected addition, but I liked them on there to balance out the savory items.  The syrup (BBQ maple) wasn't overpowering or even really like BBQ at all.  It all just worked very well together.
