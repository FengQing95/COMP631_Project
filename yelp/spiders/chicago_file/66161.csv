Smoque BBQ////This is a no frills BBQ joint that is there to do one thing, and it is to deliver to your taste buds the best BBQ this side of the Midwest. Any BBQ place worth its salt does one thing right, and that is the brisket. Smoque absolutely does not disappoint in this regard. It is juicy, tender, and practically melts in your mouth with each bite. The ribs are also great, as is the Mac N Cheese and BBQ chicken. If you are craving or missing some southern BBQ, Smoque will fill that void.
