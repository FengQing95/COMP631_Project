Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Very solid, but if youve been to au cheval and gilt bar, you kind of know what to expect.  Yes, the meat was good here (ordered the rib eye since we were told that would be easiest for sharing).  Tried the burger too.  Again, just like those other places, everything here is very solid, but also pretty hearty and heavy.  They season well and use butter, hence why things taste good.  I think I prefer going to gilt bar for the other pasta, fish, and veggie dishes they offer, and they still have a good rib eye as well.  But yes, bavettes is still very very good.
