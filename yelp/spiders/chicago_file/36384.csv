Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I loved our dinner at Bavette's.  We left with our bellies full of delicious food.  Bavette's won't be one of my "go-to" favorites because of the price point (almost $200 for us which included three cocktails, an appetizer, two entrees, two shared sides, and one dessert).  But it is a lovely place to celebrate anything or a rare treat.
