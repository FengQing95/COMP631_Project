Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My youngest son just ate oysters - 2 types from the west coast and 2 types from the east coast. Fresh and perfectly shucked (although a bit on the steep side at $3.50 a pop). My oldest son had the burger - which had two patties and an absurdly large portion of fries - both delicious.
