Art Institute of Chicago////This is one of the greatest collections of art in the world (and more impressive than many European galleries I have visited).  The visitor's guide is a must if you only have a short time, as it has a list of the "must see" works in the museum.  It saves time and makes your trip more enjoyable.  The staff is helpful, and it shows that they have pride in this amazing place.  The price is steep, so be sure to look for any discounts or free nights (I'm not sure they offer them anymore, but there were free nights at one point).  This is worth the wait in line, or worth purchasing a fast pass.  I discover a new favorite work every time I am here, and the special exhibits are always top-notch.
