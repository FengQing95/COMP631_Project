Little Goat Diner////I thought this was good, not great. I had the grilled cheese which was very rich but tasty enough. I couldn't taste the bacon. The fried pickles and onions were not good. They were tempura battered which I didn't expect , I wish that had been in the description. They were very bland , incredibly flavorless. I should've sent them back. My husband liked his scallion pancake. My daughter's chocolate chip pancakes were no better then any others she's had. Our waiter was nice and I did have a good cocktail. I'm glad I tried it but I would not go out of my way to return.
