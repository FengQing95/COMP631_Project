Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered the soup of the day (french onion, w/crouton, w/out cheese), the spinach bread, the house garden salad with red wine vinagrette, and the individual deep dish with extra cheese, sausage and tomato. Â Timing of the food arrival was well managed, in fact, Mindy told me up front what to expect - 30 minutes on the pie, 15 min on the spinach bread, and the rest asascgbagt (as soon as she could go back and get them).
