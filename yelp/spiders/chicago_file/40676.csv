Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The service at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba was great and the atmosphere was nice. My husband and I split 4 tapas (a good amount of food!). The ribs, which come with the world's best mashed potatoes, was our favorite. The beef skewer was a little disappointing because it was small: only five small chunks of beef (although high quality). The other tasty tapa was the shrimp - I recommend you dip your bread in the garlic butter sauce. It is slightly spicy but oh, so good! We will definitely try this place again.
