Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As a Chicago transplant in Virginia, I always crave TRUE CHICAGO STYLE DEEP DISH PIZZA. So when I found out Lou Malnati's delivered across country, I immediately ordered 6 pizzas for friends and family. Pizzeria Due's used to be my favorite along with Milano's but Lou Malnati's is my new favorite. Tremendous butter crust with the perfect amount of yeast, and sausage and cheese combination that is absolutely fantastic!!! I love the fact I can now get a "Taste of Chicago" at anytime!!! Thanks Lou Malnati's!!!
