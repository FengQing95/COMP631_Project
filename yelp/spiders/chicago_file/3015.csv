The Purple Pig////I went there for valentine's day dinner and was honestly really disappointed with the food. With all the good reviews I expected the food to be more than mediocre. My husband and I ordered the artichoke, octopus with green beans, bone marrow and foie gras with brioche ice cream and the only thing we both liked was the foie gras, but c'mon, it's foie gras, you can't mess that up.
