Smoque BBQ////Food was OK.  My boyfriend loved the brisquet,  His ribs were average.  My pulled pork was just OK.  No real complaints about the food, but the atmosphere sucks.  We waited in a long line to eat at a place with as much personality as a Taco Bell.  I'd rather hunt for parking at Smoke Daddy's and have a beer and maybe listen to some music.
