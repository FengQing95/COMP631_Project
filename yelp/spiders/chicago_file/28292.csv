Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This specific restaurant is my favorite location from Lou's chain! I've traveled high and low from Italy to Los Angeles and no pizza compares to Lou Malnati's "The Lou". It features giant sized tomatoes and mushrooms, which are my favorite toppings for pizza. The service is good but be sure to make reservations if you can, this location fills up quick! I really like this location more so than others because during the summer they have a nice street front patio where you can people watch on Wells street and watch the trains go by! Drinks here are pretty good and reasonably priced too.
