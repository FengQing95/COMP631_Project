Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Starting with the bread-- so warm and perfectly baked. We got the whitefish Cesar salad which hands down stood out the most. This salad was incredible and you could taste every single ingredient from the anchovies to the lemon to the crispy potatoes. Our steak was cooked PERFECTLY. Better than Mastro's has done the last two times I've been. I usually don't like Bearnaise sauce, but I enjoyed this one. The elote style corn and the mashed potatoes were outstanding as well. I had never had corn with that preparation and it was delicious. The cheesecake with raspberry sauce was the perfect way to end a great meal.
