Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When in Chicago, deep dish is a must! I called in about 15 minutes before heading over to see if there would be a wait and to place my order (since I hear it can take almost an hour). The guy was nice enough to put my name down and got the pizza started. We still waited about 30 minutes once we got there.
