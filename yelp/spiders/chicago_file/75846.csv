Little Goat Diner////We had a late lunch on a Thursday afternoon. The place is very cute with kind of a hipster vibe. The menu is large and varied. My hisband had the beef noodle salad, which he enjoyed. I had the Fattoush, kind of a Mediterranean thing. It was good, but undoubtedly the strangest salad I've ever eaten due to the quinoa sprinkled liberally through the entire salad. Â It gave everything a seedy texture. Despite this, it tasted good enough.
