Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////When celebrating my birthday with my fiancee and friends, we were first introduced to a very rude waiter who made racist jokes about the birthday girl and messed up a lot of our orders. The next day I called in to report and complain and spoke to the general manager he apologized and said he would comp us gift certificates for our horrible time. Not only did we not receive them but when I called to ask for him he wasn't in. I had a horrible time there and hope you found this review useful on how they care about their customers.
