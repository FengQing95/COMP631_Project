Little Goat Diner////I went in with a party of 5 on a Saturday night. Our wait was minimal and we told the hostess we had a couple more people joining us. She was very accommodating and said she would seat us in a large booth. During Â our wait, we went to the bar area to grab a drink. I decided to get a cocktail instead of a beer and what a great choice it was! I ordered the Fresa Fresca! Mmmmm...it was tequila, lemon, agave, and strawberry black pepper shrub! It was perfectly made...not overly strong and not weak! Before you knew it, our table was ready and I didn't get a chance to order another one. I mean let's be real, as soon as we were seated at our table, I could only focus on the drool-worthy menu!
