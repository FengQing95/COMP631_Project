Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time in Chicago, I asked a few locals where I could find the bear deep dish pizza and they recommended Lou's. We went right around 5:30-6pm so it was busy and it had just rained so it was packed inside while we waited for our table (45 minutes). After we placed ourselves on the wait list we were able to pre order our pizza to cut down on the wait time once we reached the table. We ordered our version of the classic pizza except with chicken sausage. Once we got to the table it was about another 15-20 minutes before the pizza would come so we ordered the calamari as an appetizer. Unfortunately it took quite a while to come out and when it did it was cold so we sent it back for a reorder. By that time we we elbows deep in deep dish pizza and the manager, who was absolutely amazing (Matt), had already come to our table to square things away.
