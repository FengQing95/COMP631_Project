The Purple Pig////First time I went there was in 2018 during a business trip. Fantastic dining experience there, my foodie Italian colleague was marveled at this restaurant's innovative cooking and handle of variety of meats. Probably the best memory I had with Chicago. Went back again in 2021- after the pandemic, they changed the location to the opposite side of the river and to be honest; either they changed their chef or my taste butt or personal dining habits changed, it was a mediocre experience. If solely based on the first time experience, yes I would give a rating of 10, out of 5. But now? I'm not sure. 4 is the most I could rate for their current performance.
