Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The breakfast I ordered on the first visit - the Bliss Berry crepes - was amazing .  They were moist and tasty!  The second visit, I stuck to a lunch item, the tuna wrap.  The tuna was not a very high quality, which wasn't surprising given that this is a diner-type restaurant and is affordable.  Next time I'll stick to a breakfast-lunch!  Service is attentive - you can be in and out in 45 minutes with a sit-down lunch, and they're fast on the soda refills.  I highly recommend Wildberry for an inexpensive meal with a large, diverse menu of items to choose from.
