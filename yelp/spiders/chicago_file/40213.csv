Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Smoked salmon Caesar salad: the dressing has this subtle taste of citrus that makes it so refreshing. Every bite is creamy, cheesy, citrusy and little crumbles of the smoked salmon. I like the crunch bits of the house made chips. My boyfriend and I shared the half portion and we still felt like it was the perfect amount with everything else we ordered.
