Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Now I can only speak for myself because I couldn't try all the meaty tapas but by mmm's and ohh wow's that all my dining party was cooing on about, it seems the meat tapas were a hit too. The portion size was very nice, you could easily share with three other people and still have a couple of bites to yourself. They came out quick and were paced nicely.
