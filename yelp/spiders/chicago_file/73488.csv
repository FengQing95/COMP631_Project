Little Goat Diner////This place reminds me of an upscale Denny's. The interior decorator did on amazing job on the decor. I loved the wallpaper and the chandelier in the middle. I also love the fact that I can go here any time of the day because they have breakfast, lunch, and dinner items on their menu and it's open 'till late!
