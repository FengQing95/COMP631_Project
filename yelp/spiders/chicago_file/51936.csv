Smoque BBQ////Is there better brisket in the city?  That is a resounding NO!  This is the best bbq I have had in Chicago.  I have been to Texas, Kansas City and all over the country eating BBQ and Smoque is the best around.  I never had better St. Louis Ribs or Brisket.  Chopped is awesome, but sliced is good to.  The Baked Beans are to die for and mac n' cheese, forget it.  I will greatly miss Smoque when we move to Denver.  Get it while you can.
