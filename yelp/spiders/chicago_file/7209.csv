Art Institute of Chicago////As a kid, I used to absolutely love to come here.  As an adult, I still do.  I don't know what it is about the art that's beautifully displayed in here, but it moves me every time.  The Impressionist still move me every time I come here, however, I love to view all of the genres here.  I become lost in its intertwining maze of goodness each time I come here.  The Art Institute truly has one of the greatest collections of Art--all types of medium--that I've ever seen in one place.  This is a definite must stop for every Chicagoan, and tourist that comes through!
