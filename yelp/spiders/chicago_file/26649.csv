Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////All the toppings tasted fresh and the crust was crisp as can be. One thing about Malnati's is that even though it is a deep dish pizza, it holds together very well. I've been to several other deep dish pizza places where the entire pizza just falls apart when you eat it, but at Lou Malnati's the pizza is well composed. At other places, don't even think about picking it up and eating it with your hands, you need a knife and fork, but at Malnati's you can pick it up perfectly find and the crispy delicious buttery crust holds everything together like a champ!
