Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've tried the big three and I'll say that I like Gino's east the best.  This is the oldest Chicago location, and it lacks history.  The Gino's east location up the street has a great old school vibe.  The service was solid considering its a pizza wait.  The pizza itself is tasty, but in my opinion it lacks the flavor punch.  We ordered the sausage and added spinach, shrooms, and sliced tomatoes since you cant add anything to the "Lou".  Worth a try.
