Little Goat Diner////20 minutes flew by between good conversation and great people watching, but there was still no table, but we saw that the countertop open up and we were sold to have dinner there. Our server was fantastic and all knowing when it came to helping us narrow down our selections. We started with the hot crab dip and the hash browns with cheese. Enjoyed that the crap dip was served with what..ritz crackers! Haven't had those in ages! Hash browns were just okay.. one and done kinda thing.
