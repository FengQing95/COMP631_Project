Smoque BBQ////Smoque is amazing. It's far from our current residence but when we lived near Smoque it was our go to for great BBQ. Although I do miss when it wasn't so crazy busy. The owner used to be able to take the time out to speak with everyone, but now its understandably impossible given the long lines. The only downfall is it isn't located near a lot of public transportation but there are a few bus lines if you live in the area.
