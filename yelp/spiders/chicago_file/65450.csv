Smoque BBQ////Brisket: Boring. It was a bit dry. According to their website, "The deep, rich smoke flavor is complemented by a 2-layer spice rub." Sorry, but, there was absolutely no spice rub or smoke flavor in the 1/2 lb to 1 lb of brisket that I had. Luckily, I was able to use the Carolina and Spicy Memphis BBQ sauces to flavor the brisket.
