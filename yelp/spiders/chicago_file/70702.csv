Little Goat Diner////Got the veggie burger Korean style. The others in my party either got a burger or the ribs. Sides are a la cart and the serving of fries i got was humongous. Everybody cleaned out their plates. Good selection of craft beer. My cocktail was tiny but was pretty strong. Service was very good.
