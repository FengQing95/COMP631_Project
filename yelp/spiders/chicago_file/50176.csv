Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////On to the food--the bacon-wrapped dates were dripping with oil, way too greasy and burnt. The chicken & ham croquetas--just gross and tasteless. The short ribs were decent but the mashed potatoes tasted like they were out of a box with no salt or butter in them, tasted like nothing. The skewered chicken & chorizo sausage was absolutely disgusting. I ate a piece of each and I wish I had just spit it back out. The chicken was not cooked at all. I can see why people get sick after eating here. I believe them! We both felt ill for a day after eating here. We didn't actually get physically sick because we only ate a piece each of the chicken, but my stomach was definitely not happy with me. Took forever to get our check. Take it from me, you're actually a better Chicagoan if you don't ever come here to eat.
