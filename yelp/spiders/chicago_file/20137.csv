Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place was my introduction to authentic Chicago deep dish pizza!  I was in town on business and had yet to try the city's iconic pizza style. I was walking around and it was cold as f*ck outside and I pulled up the Yelp app on my phone and searched for deep dish from my current location.  This was the closest place and I ducked in.  There wasn't much selection of craft beers unfortunately and it took a good half hour for them to make the pizza. The bathroom was really cramped and awkward too.
