Smoque BBQ////This is my husband and my favorite bbq in Chicago. The first highlight is of course the food. They have 2 types of ribs: st Louis and baby back. The st Louis ribs are more rich (fatty) and are award winning. Personally I prefer the baby back (my husband prefers the st Louis) because they are leaner, to me taste meatier. The brisket is good too- my husband prefers sliced over chopped- melts in your mouth. The pulled pork is also very good.
