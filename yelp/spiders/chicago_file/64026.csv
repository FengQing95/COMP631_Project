Smoque BBQ////Smoque does take great care to make the best brisket they possible can make. Take a moment to read its BBQ manifesto, and it's clear that they are trying to emulate Hill Country 'cue with its brisket. Smoque even imports its sausage from a famous Texas family, the Mikeskas (I'd stop by the Columbus post all the time en route from Houston to Austin).
