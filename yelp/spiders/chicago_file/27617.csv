Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Food: Came here to try deep dish pizza for the first time and it did not disappoint. We tried two of their pizzas and they were great. Very hearty, nice crust, and quality ingredients. The food took a while to come out and I feel it would've been better if it were hotter, however for my first deep dish the chain Lou Malnati's is not a bad bet.
