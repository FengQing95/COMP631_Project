Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is some pretty awesome deep dish pizza. I'm not from Chicago so I don't know how it compares to other places in the area but I thought it was great. I loved the flaky crust and the thick layer of cheese. The sausage was flavored well too. Just a good and filling slice of pizza, nothing more or less. If I am ever back in the city I will definitely come here.
