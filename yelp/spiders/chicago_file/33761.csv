Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Love! Share entrees and gigantic sides...best way to try the menu. the Chicago Ribeye, carved prime rib sandwich, tomatoes, loaded baked potato were fantastic. The appetizer: duck with goat cheese terrain was ok, we'll try the goat cheese next time! Brandon, our waiter, was knowledgeable about the menu. Â The rest of the staff were great!! Definitely going back!
