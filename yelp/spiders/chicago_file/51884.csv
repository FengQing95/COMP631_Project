Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////In the middle of our meal, we ordered the buttermilk-fried chicken thighs from their limited dinner menu. This took a few extra minutes to come out compared to the rest of our dishes (which were brought to our table within 10 minutes of ordering). The chicken was good with a tangy sauce that made for a nice contrast, but nothing spectacular. Our waitress apologized several times for the delay, and also brought us complimentary desserts (pear sorbet and caramelized banana). Ended our meal on a sweet note. Needless to say, impressive service!
