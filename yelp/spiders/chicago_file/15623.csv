Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My original rating was only 2 stars (I'll leave my first review up there).  I've added 2 more stars to my rating after experience their outstanding customer service.  I guess their customer service department read my review.  They sent me a private message apologizing for my unsatisfactory experience and asked for my phone number.  The manager of this location called me personally to apologize and sent me a couple pizzas from Chicago to Los Angeles!  This time around the pizza/crust was not hard and impossible to cut at all (and it was mailed to me frozen), the toppings were still great.  I was very surprised and impressed by their effort to satisfy their customers.  Yay! I'm a fan!
