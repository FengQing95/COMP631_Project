Little Goat Diner////Amazing amazing food. Too many choices but we narrowed down to Macho nachos and jerk chicken Sammie. Huge portions we couldn't even eat half of the food. The best part was the cozy upscale diner feel and the best server. Anthony was awesome and we would definitely come back and ask for his table again if we ever return to Chicago. Love little goat. Can't wait to try new items next time =)
