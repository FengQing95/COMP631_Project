Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Based on my past experience here and the good reviews on Yelp, I expected better.  Better dining accommodations (small tables don't work in a tapas place), better wait service (maybe adding staff so that mistakes and neglect such as I listed above don't happen), and better food (flavorless tapas?  I'd rather stop by a Vienna Beef hotdog stand and get some bang for my buck).
