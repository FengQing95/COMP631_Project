Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////...it arrived. Not very ceremoniously and soul-crushingly small (to be fair it was personal size). I took my first bite, it was tasty, cheesy and pizza-y everything I expected a pizza to be... but nothing spectacular. The good thing about pizza is that it is good, even when it's bad (*insert sex joke here*), Lou Malnati's pizza is for lack of a better word: good, but as far as the hype goes, expect to be merely "-whelmed" neither over or under.
