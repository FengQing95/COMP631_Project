Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Decent, crowded, and well run.  A typical Lettuce Entertain You take on the Tapas restuarant.  Kind of on the pricey side, but food is good and on the bigger side, they suggest maybe 2-3 plates per person, but 2 was good from me, and I am known to be a prodigeous eater.  Everything I had was good, calamari, empanada, skirt steak, spicy potatoes, ham plate.  This location is in the middle of Lincoln Park, and has the crowd you'd expect.  The place is quite large, and service is nice and quick.  Parking is nightmarish on busy weekend nights.  Good place for groups.
