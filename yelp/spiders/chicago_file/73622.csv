Little Goat Diner////I know I'm being harsh on this place. I know it. But people will throw their money at anything that has hype around it. The menu has a lot of intriguing things on it. And I know I'll get dragged back here because all my friends who visit would want to go. But when a brunch for two gets up to $40 and you realize that all you got was a play on chicken and waffles and and a sandwich, you start to question if it was worth it or not.
