Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////If you love Gilt Bar, you'll love Bavette's.  Sexy atmosphere (we sat downstairs), great food, and delish drinks.  Duck & Goat Cheese Terrine - awesome. If you've gotten anything on toast at Gilt Bar, this will look familiar to you. Had a filet that was cooked to perfection, and the herb roasted tomatoes on the side were delightful. Finally, the elotes - love their spin on the classic streetfood.  Doesn't beat the original, but I welcome this as an alternative side dish.
