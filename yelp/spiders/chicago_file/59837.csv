Smoque BBQ////Anyways, back to the rest of the food. The mac and cheese is really as good as everyone says: super creamy, real cheese taste, beautiful crust. The fries seemed fresh cut and the portion was huge. I tried a bite of my boyfriend's chopped brisket and was surprised by how juicy and flavorful it was. We both liked the coleslaw well enough but it was primarily regular cabbage--not much color in there.
