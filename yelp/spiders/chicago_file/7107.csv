Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute is MUCH better for members now that we don't have to order tickets to see special exhibits. A colleague and I breezed through what could have been an arduous entry process for Cezanne to Picasso on May Â by simply showing our membership cards. Free entry is a wonderful benefit, and there are so many wonderful works here. The gift shop also has some great items. Definitely will renew my membership.
