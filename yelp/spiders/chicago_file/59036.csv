Smoque BBQ////Personally, the sauce was way too vinegar-ey for me (and there was only the ONE sauce) and the cornbread was dry. The highlight of the meal was the macaroni and cheese (which I would come back for even by itself-despite the fact that the portions are a little on the small side). The coleslaw was only "meh"....
