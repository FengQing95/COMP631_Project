The Purple Pig////The waiter suggested 3-4 dishes between two people, so we got the crispy pork ear as appetizer, pork shoulder and half duck as entry, and eventually latte and Sicilian iris as desert. The food was quite extraordinary. Crispy pig ear was certainly innovative and fun to start with, pork should is super comforting, the half duck impressed me and the portion was generous, and finally the Sicilian Iris was rich and delightful.
