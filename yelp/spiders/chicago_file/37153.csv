Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The Ribeye was perfectly cooked the way we wanted it (MEDIUM RARE of course). The outside was nicely cooked where the insides were a perfect medium rare. They provided this steak salt seasoning to add on to your steak, but that was not needed as the steak was full of flavor already. It said on the menu that it would e 22 oz, and we figured the bone to weigh the most, however, there was barely a bone to this bone-in ribeye. Two people sharing this dish is the perfect amount to be honest.
