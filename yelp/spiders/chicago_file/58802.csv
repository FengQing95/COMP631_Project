Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cute spot for tapas, a chicago classic! Brought a friend here from out of town last week. The service was fantastic! We had patatas bravas, garlic shrimp, goat cheese, and vegetable paella. Not sure if I'm a big paella fan but everything else was pretty tasty! I don't drink but my friend had the mango sangria and said it was amazing!!! Would come again for an occasion or fun night out.
