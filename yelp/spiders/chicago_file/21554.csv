Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered two large pizzas, the Lou(Spinach mix, fresh tomatoes, 3 cheeses), and the Chicago classic(Sausage, extra cheese). Here is where I have mixed opinions. Despite the lack of meat, the Lou is probably one of my favorite deep dish pizzas in Chicago. The extra tomatoes and the fresh spinach mix really just makes it all taste vibrant, and the cheese with the sauce really just brings it all together in an oozing fatty mess of deliciousness. The Chicago Classic on the other hand....the plate of sausage was nice but I think I prefer the sausage at Giordano's(Lou's was about equal to Gino's in that respect). However the ratios of the Chicago classic were a bit off for my tastes: far too much cheese and crust and not enough sauce. In the end I sort of just wanted an extra side of sauce just so I could dip the extra cheesy bread.
