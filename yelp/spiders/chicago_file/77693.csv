Little Goat Diner////Best brunch I've ever had. Little Goat knows how to bring big, punchy flavor that is plated with finesse. Â We had "This little piggy went to China" as well as a daily special that was a mole quesadilla made with Bourbon County Brand Stout. Both were phenomenal with hearty portions. We had the pork belly potatoes as well, and it was plenty to share. Service was perfect. Will definitely be back!
