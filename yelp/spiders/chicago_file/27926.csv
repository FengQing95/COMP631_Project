Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Upon finish our pizza, our initial waiter returns to collect the pizza pan and saying "good job" for finishing our small pizza. Frustrated and annoyed about the service and attitude in this place, we skipped dessert and got the check. ABSOLUTELY one of the worst customer service experiences I've had in restaurant.
