Little Goat Diner////On my latest visit, I met a friend for a farewell Chicago lunch. I'm so glad that I got to eat at Little Goat one more time before relocating. The menu is so varied that I had a hard time making up my mind about what to order. I was deciding between ordering the tuna melt and a "healthy" chickpea salad. I asked the server for her recommendation, and she raved about the tuna melt that is served open-faced and topped with their mac n cheese sauce.
