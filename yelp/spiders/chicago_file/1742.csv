Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This is a nice spot and the food was good. The server did not provide the best service. I understand it was closing time but I find it rude to take things (except empty plates) off the table when customers are still eating. To reach over our plates without saying excuse me. I felt a little rushed, why ask someone do they want containers while they are still eating. Not once did she ask how was our food or if we need anything. I would go back but not that servers section.
