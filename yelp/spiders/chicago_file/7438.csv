Art Institute of Chicago////This was among the best exhibits in the place.  Basically, it's kind of like a bunch of REALLY INTRICATE dollhouses.  Real (or maybe real-ish) places, scaled down to create just...these entire scenes!  Bedrooms and salons and churches and all sorts of places.  And there are rugs and teeny dishes and teeny clocks and all the molding and everything is there.  And then, the scene doesn't stop in the room -- take a look through the doors and windows and you can see backyards and neighboring rooms and all sorts of things.  The amount of time and effort that went into these is incredible and there are just A TON!  We didn't even get to finish them all!  It was kind of fascinating and definitely worth a trip to the basement!
