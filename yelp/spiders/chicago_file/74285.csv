Little Goat Diner////Let's get to the meat and potatoes of the review. I was famished and ordered the fish tostadas and split some fries with my friend. WOW, these tostadas. The fish was battered and fried and laid on top of the fried tortilla. If you're thinking like I was and thinking that this would be a greasy meal, we would be mistaken. The rest of the dish is completely balanced out with a vinegery shallot aoli and chickpea onion salad which was the much-needed refreshing element of the dish. The onions were a perfect complement to the fried food, and the chickpeas added the perfect amount of protein to the dish. To top it all off, the harissa vinegrette added another element of flavor blast to the whole meal. They give you 3 tostadas that are piled pretty high, and it was filling for $14. The fries were also well seasoned and shoe-string size. I would highly advise that you eat them as soon as they come because the quality deteriorates quickly as the fries get cold. Honestly, if the tostadas weren't out of this world, this issue with the fries would have bumped this review down to 4 stars.
