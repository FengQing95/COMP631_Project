Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was a tourist in Chicago so take my word with a grain of salt, but my friend and I tried both Lou Malnati's and Giordano's, and Lou Malnati's was better! There was less overall cheese (still plenty though) and more sauce, and they made the crust nice and buttery somehow. Service was kind of slow, but I'm guessing it's because they make the pizzas fresh.
