Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////A thin slice of chorizo rapped around a date stuffed with manchego cheese, then a hit to the palate from a braised short rib stuffed roasted red pepper.  After that comes a heirloom tomato salad and a cup of gazpacho.  All the while I sip glasses of red wine sangria and munch on chewy bread slices.
