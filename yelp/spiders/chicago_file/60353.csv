Smoque BBQ////Where can you find an awesome pulled pork sandwich for only $7.95.  You can also do a brisket, sliced or chopped.  OR try their 1/2 & 1/2, any two, how kick ass is that.  I've had both the St. Louis ribs and the Baby backs.  Can't decide...  you have to see which cut of meat you love best.  Get this.. you can add a side of say.. 1/4 portion of St. Louis ribs.. or a portion of brisket  or pulled pork for just $3 bucks.
