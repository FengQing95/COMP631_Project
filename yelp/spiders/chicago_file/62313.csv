Smoque BBQ////The first thing we had was the Memphis-Style Baby Rack Ribs which were amazing. Succulent in flavor, great crispy burnt texture on the outside, but soft tender meet you can bite off the bone on the inside. Next, the Sliced Brisket was so, so tender and every little bite had a burst of flavor. The outside was nice and burnt, crispy but the rest of the meat was so soft and juicy. I know I'm making all the Texas Rudy's BBQ fans cry by saying this, but I never liked the brisket there and therefore resigned in thinking I just didn't like BBQ. So in a way...Smoque has changed my (bbq) life.
