Little Goat Diner////5 of us ordered the French Toast with the cooked egg in it. 3 of those plates came out with the egg completely raw (clear whites), one was sent back, and when we mentioned it to the manager, we just kind of got a shrug and a "I'll talk to the chef" with nothing else done. Big letdown for how much hype. Wasn't terrible but definitely wasn't up to what I had heard. Maybe just a one off?
