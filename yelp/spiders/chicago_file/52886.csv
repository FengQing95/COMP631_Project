Smoque BBQ////Delicious!!  Smoque is pretty no frills, but it seems as they put all the extra energy straight into the food, which was amazing.  This place can get busy, so be prepared to wait a bit, but they run an efficient operation, so things move pretty fast. I had the brisket and my date had ribs. Both were fabulous, which I may have mentioned a few times at this point. The rib meat pretty much just fell off the bone and the brisket had such a great flavor. An older gentleman who seemed to be somewhat in charge even brought over some more sauces and candied jalapenos for us to sample.  The sides were pretty great too, mac and cheese, cornbread, and peach cobbler.  Smoque, you delivered some knock out food. Keep up the great work.
