Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our service was pretty mediocre. I don't feel like our server knew her wine. When we asked for a recommendation, it seemed as though she knew as much as we did about the wine list. Our total dining experience was a little over three hours and I think it took way too long to get our food. They gave us a complimentary side of corn but then we didn't have plates to eat Â it with. It was just kind of weird.
