Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The only reason this place could not get a 5 star is because of the sketchy liquor.   I understand this is pizza place not a bar but when you oder stoli it should taste like what the bottle says. I know businesses do this but I am an avid vodka drinker and cheap LQ makes me sick...literally.  The bar tenders face turned red so I knew it was a problem already.   The staff took me drink back and I ordered crown on the rocks.  It was sketchy too but the pizza made up for everything! I will definitely come back when I come back to the city!!
