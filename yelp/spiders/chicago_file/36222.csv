Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The waiter approached our table and asked if we wanted him to open the bottle. I said sure, and then apologized (unnecessarily) for bringing our own wine, explaining that it was our one-year anniversary and this was a special bottle. He asked under his breath if we were aware of the "corkage policy", which we assumed was a simple $35 charge on the bill. He gave no further explanation. He then brought over 3 wine glasses to the table (there were only 2 of us) and poured me a taste. I was confused at the presence of glass #3, but tasted it nonetheless, and thanked him. He then proceeded to pour my husband and I small glasses, and an enormous goblet of our special wine into the third glass on the table. My eyes welled up with tears as I got the feeling that glass wasn't for us. He asked me who I wanted to give the wine to (their policy is that you share a glass of your wine with someone in the restaurant if you bring your own bottle, instead of charging you a fee). I was speechless and began to cry. He took the glass anyway, and headed into the kitchen. I don't know where that glass went--to another diner, or maybe into his own mouth--but I was so astonished that he would take a huge glass of our wine without even asking about its significance, I could barely order.
