Little Goat Diner////The food that we did get was pretty good, but I wasn't blown away like I was expecting to be. I had the Parathas Burrito, and I ate the whole thing because I was so hungry, but I probably wouldn't order it again. I was still hungry after I finished and just felt like I could make something better at home. I will say that the goat chili is worth trying. It was hearty and had good flavor. My friends said their food was good, but nobody was raving about anything. I'd give this place another try, but I would try to arrive a little earlier in the future.
