Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Last night my cognac Sazerac was spot on. My Classic Ribeye - Chicago Cut was, like the last two times I was there, delicious and cooked perfectly "("Pittsburgh rare"). My companion said her Halibut special (with a parsley/red onion side salad) was terrific. I was less enamored of the sides. The Pommes Frites were just fries, but they were good (not great) fries, with a nice garlic aioli, the Elote Style Corn did absolutely nothing for me (though my companion seemed to like it), and, like the Elote, the Wild Mushrooms were, to my mind, so-so at best. The Lemon Meringue Pie was delicious--and steakhouse-sized--though I personally prefer a little more lemony (and lemon curd-like) pie filling. Here, it was more like lemon cream, if there is such a thing.
