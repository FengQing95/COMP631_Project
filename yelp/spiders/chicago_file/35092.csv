Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My new favorite restaurant in the city!  The food, ambiance, service were all top  notch. The 24 oz Bone In Dry Aged Ribeye and thought it was fantastic. and plenty to split with a friend. Also enjoyed the Lillet Rose Martini with St Germain..it was yummy!  The corn had a little to  much sauce for my liking but was still very good and the broccoli was charred a bit and excellent. Wasn't able to get reservations on line but was seated right away when we arrived around 5:30 on a week day.
