Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Now I haven't tried many deep dishers, but as far as I'm concerned, Lou's is the best.  Sure, there can be quite a wait for tables, especially on a warm summer night, but the staff is very friendly and will take your order while you wait at the bar and enjoy a sample of their prized pizza.  This particualr location is pretty big, so it is perfect for groups or watching sports on their numerous TVs, and the vibe is a nice mix of locals and out-of-town visitors.  And what can I say about the pizza- it is truly a masterpiece.  The crust is perfectly crispy, and the pizza is totally stuffed with the right blend of tomato sauce, cheese, and various toppings.  If you are a bread lover, I recommend not getting any toppings- the crust and cheese will put you in heaven!  Lou Malnati's is definitely a must for that classic Chicago pizza!
