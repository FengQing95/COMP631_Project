Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////i ordered the lous and the classic,  pretty mich what everyone recommended.  im sorry to say,  it was not what i expected,  not juicy,  nothing special with the cheese and sauage. it is just a different shape of pizza.  crust is just okay.  overall,  deep dish pizza does not worth 45 - 60minutes wait
