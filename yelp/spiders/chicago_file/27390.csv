Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I hadn't eaten since early morning and we were out all day, so I was so hungry when I got there. To watch my husband eat a meal while I waited, was tough. I didn't eat until after 7 pm. I never fault a restaurant for not being gluten free friendly, but I DO fault a restaurant for saying they take every precaution and not to worry, then find out that they take none. If I had eaten that pizza, I'd have been so sick . Â
