Little Goat Diner////Next the food - most everything was underwhelming. The mac n' cheese was creamy, but some cheese flavor would be great...very bland. The sloppy goat and chicken tostada (BPS) were decent. The hot crab dip is nothing special. We drizzled the house chipotle hot sauce on everything!
