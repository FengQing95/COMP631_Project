Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ok, I'm only writing this to get it off my pop up once and for all.  I feel like I may as well be reviewing Dominos though!  Yes its a Chicago legend, yes it's got deep dish pizza.  Aside from all that though, if you're not a tourist, it's really not all that.  Sure you can pop in and experience it but if you really want good pizza there are about a million places in Chicago I'd recommend before this chain.  So if you're reading this in search of a great place to eat Chicago pizza please do some research because I believe you'll be less than impressed with this place.
