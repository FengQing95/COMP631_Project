The Purple Pig////Communal style seating, which is cool. However, the seat I sat at, which is not designed great at all - high table near the window, three of us were at the end of the table. This meant every time someone that was sitting in the inner seats had to get up, I had to stand up to let them out because there wasn't enough space behind the table. (4x I had to do this and this is why I subtracted 1 Star)
