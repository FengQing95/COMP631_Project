Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After looking through the menu, we decided on "The Lou," which is fresh spinach, mushrooms, and sliced tomatoes covered with mozzarella, romano and cheddar cheese.  We also added sausage since we're all fans of it.  Originally we wanted the flat disc ones but when it came it was the typical sausage.  Probably just misheard, oh well.
