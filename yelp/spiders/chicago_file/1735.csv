Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The food was awesome--I had the wildberry pancakes and an omelette special that rocked.  I didn't really like the OJ with berry juice in it (too sweet), but everything else was great.  The server was really professional too and you could tell it was a popular place.  Since it was a weekday, I didn't have to wait.  If I'm ever in Chicago again, I'll go back!
