Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My favorite place to eat in Chicago hands down! It's hard to go there and not get at least three orders of the bacon wrapped dates. So many other great options to choose from as well. Just make sure to book your reservation well in advance if you're going on a weekend, because they fill up fast!
