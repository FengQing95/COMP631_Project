Little Goat Diner////This is a good place for really creative fusion. The decor is straight hipster and the music is always good. Generally packed and often pretty loud -- so if you're looking for a nice intimate dinner this is probably not the best place. The food is consistently great. The biscuits and gravy (my Southerner is showing) are a total hit and taste just like the handmade buttermilk biscuits my Gran would serve up when I was a kid. [It's difficult to quantify how good that really is.] The fried chicken was a total miss, but we can't have everything. The Bulls Eye French Toast is *fantastic* and a perfect dish if you're wanting sweet and savory. The apple(?) pancakes are a little too sweet for me, but if you like sweets then it's definitely for you. The burgers are awesome. A note: if you're celiac, the celiac burger is more like a "celiac steak taco" according to our friend who ordered it. Â
