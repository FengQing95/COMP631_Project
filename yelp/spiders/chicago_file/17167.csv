Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was in the mood for some authentic Chicago deep dish pizza and I found this place. Overall a good experience although I personally found the pizza lacking in flavor. It was freshly made and took 30 min to make (which is typical for a real deep dish). But it tasted like bland cheese, tomatoes and sausage. I just though a little salt n pepper or other seasonings were absent. The atmosphere was nice but I doubt I'll go back. If you wait 30 min for pizza it better be the best pizza you've ever had.
