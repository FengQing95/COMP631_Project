Art Institute of Chicago////Excellent art gallery! I came here for the Monet exhibit and was surprised to find that it was a one hour wait (I had to sign up via text), but it was well worth it! I was able to enjoy about half of the museum during that wait. Very extensive collections here. Highly recommend!
