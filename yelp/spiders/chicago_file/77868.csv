Little Goat Diner////I was in Chicago for a short conference and I knew I had to make it out of my hotel in Rosemont to venture into the city for a good meal.  I wasn't able to get a reservation at Girl and the Goat but I was able to get a counter reservation for 1 at Little Goat Diner. This ended up being a great choice for a solo diner so I didn't feel as lonely at a table by myself.  The waitress was very nice and helpful in the menu options.  The couple next to me even offered their suggestions to me.
