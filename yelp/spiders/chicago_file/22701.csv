Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They had an awesome system of allowing you to order your pizza as soon as you're on the waitlist for a table. We got seated and ordered non-pizza items while we waited, i.e. appetizers, salads, etc. Patience started to wear away with my crowd after we finished that, and I assured them that it would be worth the wait (even though I wasn't sure myself, but what else could I say?) sure enough pizza came out and it was outstanding! I ended up the hero. I wanted to order a standard pepperoni but I was out outnumbered with a crowd that wanted a loaded pizza, so I ordered a personal pan pepperoni in addition to the loaded large we got. Both were awesome and cooked to perfection! To each his (or her) own, but I say go for the pepperoni, although I think the larger size pizza is better. Calamari appetizer and house salad were good too.
