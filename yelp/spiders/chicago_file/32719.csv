Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The server was named Stephanie, Samantha or Christina, or something like that (multiple syllables).  She was quite nice; attentive, cheerful, helpful, politely making conversations and laughing at our jokes politely, of which it's quite difficult to tell if genuine at a restaurant with such a high-priced menu.  It's quite obvious that your restaurant makes its main profits from the sides, salads, wines, and drinks, as most restaurants do.  However, the wines we sampled were quite boring and unspectacular.  Wine doesn't need to be expensive to be good.  In fact, my girlfriend and I have discovered numerous wines under $10 per bottle that are just as good or better than those with much higher prices.  To each their own when it comes to wines and perhaps we have psychologically conditioned ourselves to enjoy wine that is more economical?  Though I doubt that considering there are some expensive items that do NOT have cheaper alternatives on par (Balsamic Vinegar, dark chocolate, farm fresh free-range eggs, sprouted grain breads,etc.).  It would look a bit silly and unbalanced to have $60 steaks while offering $10 wines as pairings.  The $5 per bottle Tempranillo (2012 or 2013) by Opera Prima winery of Spain that we often drink would have paired much better than the $50 Malbec we settled on.  Another excellent, well-priced, winery is Casillero del Diablo of Chile.  (hint hint, the best wines come from Chile)
