Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////- Patatas Bravas: 4/5, I order these at every tapas restaurant I go to. I loved the flavor of the aioli but it was super thick so you couldn't really dip the potatoes in so much as smear it on them. Also, it looked like someone had literally just thrown stuff together on a plate and brought it out. Overall though I would order and eat them again happily.
