Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our wonderful and attentive server introduced himself and waters were procured. We perused the menu and decided we'd each try an Old Fashioned, naively unaware that they would be the BEST OLD FASHIONEDs we'd ever had. (They still rank tops.) Â I selected the Belle Mead Old Fashioned while the fella went for the Landy Cognac. Both were AMAZING and we were resigned to disagree on who made the better choice.
