Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My friend and I were looking for a pizza place and we ended at a fancy restaurant. We told the server we wanted to try a Chicago style pizza (deep dish), and she recommended Lou Malnati's Pizzeria. After thanking her and politely exiting the fancy place, we walked to Lou Malnati's Pizzeria, and WOW...this was the best pizza I have ever tried!
