Little Goat Diner////Food- we tried 4 things: the Mac and cheese was deliciously creamy with crispy Parmesan and breadcrumbs on top, the fried pickles and onion rings were nice and light (tempura battered, and sweet pickles if you're curious) and served with mustard and ranch dipping sauces, the beef stew was just ok (underwhelming and too soupy, to be honest) and the paratha burrito was very flavorful (but got soggy at the end, because it was sitting on a bed of sauce)
