Smoque BBQ////I was underwhelmed with their bbq'd meats.  And walking into the place, thought it was ok.  Kind of divey which is kool.  The sides were solid.  Atmosphere was fun.  We got there just in time to beat the rush bc the line was out the door.  Maybe I was disappointed bc there was so much hype about this place.  My expectations were pretty high.  Not a place I'd visit again.  I was visiting from NY and had a better experience at another bbq joint.
