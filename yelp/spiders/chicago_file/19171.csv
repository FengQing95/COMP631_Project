Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Let me admit, I'm not the biggest pizza person - and not a big fan of beer. If you are, you might enjoy this spot. Compared to other deep dish pizzeria's it's more spacious and has a more expansive menu. The waitstaff seemed really happy and we're definitely attentive. Ingredients weren't as fresh as I like them, but I still enjoyed. I'd visit again but I'm not in a hurry.
