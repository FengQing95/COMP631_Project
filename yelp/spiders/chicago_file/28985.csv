Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////lous lives up to the hype. i was a bit skeptical because it seemed like one of the tourist traps. however, i love the crust of the deep dish here. its buttery, slightly crunchy, but doughy all at once. the traditional deep dish is a must get. its over welming, so i suggest sharing it. their service was okay, takes a little while to get your pizza and other things. however, the tiramisu was good too! it almost looked too perfect but i really liked it.
