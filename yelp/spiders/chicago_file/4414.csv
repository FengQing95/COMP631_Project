The Purple Pig////Oh I've missed you Purple Pig! Although this place is obviously popular for its pork- the seafood is amazing as well (except the squid ink ravioli- it's one of the nastiest things I've ate). The service was alright- seem like she was a little annoyed. The restaurant itself is either too loud inside or too hot outside. No reservations, so there'll probably be like a 20-30 min wait, but there's so much to do in that area aka shopping!
