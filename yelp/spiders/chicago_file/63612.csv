Smoque BBQ////The only qualms I have with Smoque are associated with a fairly weak ambience. First off, it's a pain in the ass to find seating and get the order. Often times they are so crowded that I cannot hear my number and the food sits. The sauce serving size is meager and they should (like most other Chicago BBQ joints) absolutely put bottles of sauce on all tables! No reason this place should go cheapskate on the sauce given the juggernaut they are in Chicago. Serving size could be larger on the non-rib end, as well.
