Art Institute of Chicago////Nice museum!  They have the Magritte exhibit which was done quite well.  The exhibit itself was well worth the price of admission.  We visited the Tortured Clown exhibit...ummmm...it was bizarre...and we are open minded folks and we walked out within seconds and so did other patrons.  Maybe it was not for the masses.  We almost did not go into the museum but made a last minute decision to visit.  Glad we did!!
