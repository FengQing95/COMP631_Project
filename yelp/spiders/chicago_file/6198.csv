The Purple Pig////Service was also AMAZING and the staff was super on it! Our plates were cleared whenever an empty plate was noticed. Our water glasses were filled whenever one was half full. Loved the attention and prompt decision making skills that made our dining experience here so easy. We were really able to just focus on the quality of the food, the company of the people eating with us, and the wonderful city we were visiting.
