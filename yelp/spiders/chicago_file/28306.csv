Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came here STARVING so good thing we ordered appetizers since they told us the pizzas don't come out until like 45 minutes later. We ordered one order of the flatbread that came with 3 different types of dip. This was able to feed our party of 6 - Portions are huge. The dips were good. There was a garlic one, a cheesy one, and one that looked like hummus (It wasn't hummus but couldn't tell what it was). After eating this, I was already full.. haha.
