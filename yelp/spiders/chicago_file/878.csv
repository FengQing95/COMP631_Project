Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Food And drinks were delicious! I had the orange juice which was very fresh. Wife had hazelnut latte, which was the best latte I've ever had. The Belgian waffle was very good but the portion was a bit small for the price. The Mexicana skillet was very good and considering it also comes with toast or pancakes is a great portion for the price.
