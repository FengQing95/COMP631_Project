Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza is pretty solid. I've had the personal, the thin, and the stuffed, in multiple topping variations. Haven't been disappointed once. It's cooked exactly how I ask and the same goes when I order pick up. I've used the app for pickup and haven't had any mistakes when ordering. I find it better tasting than Edwardo's, Giordano's and definitely steps above Pizza Hut, Dominoe's, Little Caesar's, etc.
