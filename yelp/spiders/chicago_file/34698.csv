Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I have to admit that this place puts the best New York City steakhouses (Luger's, Wolfgang's, Ruth's Chris) to shame.  We did not have reservations but arrived early enough on a Saturday night and were able to secure one of their smaller cocktail tables in the back.  I ordered the bone-in filet and it was cooked a perfect medium rare plus.  We also ordered the king crab legs and they were perfectly prepared.  Their french fries are also very good.  I will definitely return to this restaurant if I am ever in Chicago again.
