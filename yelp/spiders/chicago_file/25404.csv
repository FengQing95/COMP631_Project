Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Hey, it's Chicago Deep Dish Pizza at it's finest. I love Lou Malnati's and have been there countless times. Â The sausage deep dish pizza is a classic, and one I gladly recommend to people visiting Chicago who want to try those "Chicago-Style" pizzas that they've heard about.
