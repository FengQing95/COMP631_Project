Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////(a young women) refused to take my order. I had wanted to place the order and pick it up at 3:30. I was told that wouldn't be possible. I would have to come back at 3 pm to place the order or I would have to call the order in at 3 pm and then pick it up. I was a bit flabbergasted. I left and, not surprisingly, decided I would not be placing an order with Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba. It's too bad, up until yesterday, I would have gladly patronized this restaurant on a regular basis.
