Little Goat Diner////I was so excited to go here as an alternative to G & the G.  Service & ambiance were great but food was very  mediocre. It has a cool, diner vibe and is very loud & noisy. The booth we sat in had a ripped seat and a big hole in it.  This was unappealing.  We had the crab dip that was good but not outstanding. We also had the fried chicken that was skimpy on the meat (does freebird mean skinny chicken?) and, again, not outstanding.  We tried the smoked pork & toffee crunch shake for something different. It had a slight pork flavor with toffee and chocolate pieces. It was tasty but a big soupy mess and not the thick, shake consistency that I was expecting. Glad I tried this place.  It has an interesting menu but don't need to go back with all of the wonderful choices on Randolph.
