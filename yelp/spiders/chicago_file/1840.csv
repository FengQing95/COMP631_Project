Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Wildberry was recommended to me when visiting Chicago. I went twice. The first time I walked in and was told my wait would be about 25 minutes so I stuck it out. I was seated quickly once my turn on the waitlist came up. My server took my order and got my food to me at a reasonable amount of time. Everything tasted good and I was pleased. The next day, I decided to add myself to the waitlist on the app since it said it was about an hour wait. I was taking my mom who wanted pancakes. We got there on time and I checked in with the host who told me I would be receiving a second text message once our table was ready. Well, I never received that text. My mother was upset that others were being seated, and also cranky from not eating, and walked away. I understand the restaurant was busy, but this was awful. When I asked the host again 30 minutes after I've been there where our table was she said if I had gotten a text. I explained that I had done the online waitlist and had been waiting. I was then told to wait on the text for our table. I left and went somewhere else. I never got the text that day.
