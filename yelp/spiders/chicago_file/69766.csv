Little Goat Diner////I tried goat bagel with cauliflower spread, mexican roll thingy (don't know the name) and a sweet onion brioche.  They were very good.  Especially we loved the texture and cover of mexican roll.  Also tried a sample of broccoli and cheese bread.  That one was a hit.  I didn't plan on buying a lump so didn't do it, but I think I will definitely buy it some other time.
