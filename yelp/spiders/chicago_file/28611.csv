Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Frankly, I don't know a damn thing about Chicago style pizza. This was my first time in Chicago, and damnit, I just felt like being a tourist for a little minute, so I ordered the famous pie. Ive had the contender too many times to count, but your not going to find Chicago style pizza in Charleston, so I took advantage of it while here for work.
