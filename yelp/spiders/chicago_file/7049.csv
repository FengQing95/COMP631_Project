Art Institute of Chicago////Great museum! They have wide array of impressionist paintings (not a huge fan of Monet but there are many), and everything from Picasso to Pollock, Degas to Van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec to O'Keeffe. Thursday nights are free from 5-close. I would love to be a member of this museum. Oh yeah, and of course you have to see the legendary "American Gothic" by Grant Wood (on loan for the moment).
