Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Crazy noise levels, crazy crowds, but pretty damn good anyway.  I'm not hung up on the authenticity of tapas, having never eaten them in Spain (even though I've been to Spain), and I think these taste pretty damn good.  For comparison's sake, I like them better than those at Emilio's.
