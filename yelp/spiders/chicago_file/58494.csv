Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Oh. My. God. This had to be my favorite restaurant while visiting Chicago. I NEED ONE IN LA! 5 stars for the food hands down. Little, almost EVERYTHING had me dancing in my seat and just rolling my eyes in pure food heaven pleasure.  Place was packed (and now I completely understand why) and just smelled amazing. I am so happy I had this place on my list and that I was able to eat here.  Definitely make reservations!!!!  But I would wait for the food either way haha.
