Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's, in my opinion, is the best deep dish pizza in Chicago. You must try to the Chicago Classic. The sausage is layered in the pizza so you get an even bite of sausage at every bite. The tomato sauce is sweet and savory. The cheese just brings everything together. You won't regret it. When out-of-town friends and family ask where to get deep dish, there is only one answer - Lou's!
