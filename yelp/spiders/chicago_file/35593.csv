Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Absolutely unbelievable!  The best steak I have ever eaten, 42 day aged bone-in ribeye!  To die for!  The restaurant has it all from ambiance to service to good and drink quality. Our server, Meredith, was the best. Totally attentive to our needs from wine and steak recommendations, to the right sharable sides, she was right on. Very knowledgeable about her menu and a very pleasant personality. I would recommend Bavette's for any occasion!
