Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We ate in the cellar and that will be our dining stable in the future, a speakeasy if there was one. Our server was fantastic, he provided excellent service by never leaving us wanting but also never overstaying his welcome, a perfect balance of service. He helped guide me through some wines and paired them expertly with my food selections. My partner enjoyed several mixed which were well balanced and fresh.
