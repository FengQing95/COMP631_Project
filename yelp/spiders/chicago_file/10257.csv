Art Institute of Chicago////Although the general layout of the different buildings connecting together took me a couple of wrong turns to figure out, this is the best space for you to find yourself lost (this place is appreciatingly big), because even lost, you will be surrounded something that should catch your fancy or whimsy -- or just might amaze you. If you read maps better than me, you may be fine (it's entirely possible I'm just still affected by the trauma of getting lost in the Hellenistic art galleries in the Louvre).
