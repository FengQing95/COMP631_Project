Smoque BBQ////I have definitely had better pulled pork, which is what I ordered. The fries were good, but prices seemed high for basically fast food. I like that it is BYOB, but if you bring a big group, it will probably be hard to get seats. It is also noisy. I'd have to say that this place is average, overall.
