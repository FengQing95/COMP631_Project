Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The lamp and steak are also excellent and the service keeps getting better. This is my third time there, and our server knew we were a slightly rowdy business group of six but he didn't miss a beat. Again, like others have mentioned, the atmosphere is cool and people of all different tastes appreciate it. Â I will be back again, as long as I can get a reservation (which is getting harder and harder these days).
