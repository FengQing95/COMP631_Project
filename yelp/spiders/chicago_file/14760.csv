Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I know there are a lot of deep dish pizza place in Chicago, but this place was something that my brother and I during our road trip stumbled upon.  Being on the road for 4 days and arriving one stop before Indiana, took my brother to Chicago to explore!  At that time, we were both starving and try to find a nearest deep dish place and this one was a pretty good walking distance (approx. 30-45min from Millennium Park).  It was a nice atmosphere place and the server was very knowledgeable and helpful! We had a hard time deciding what size and what type of deep dish and the server suggested us that we can easily finish a small easily (we both got three slices) and he allowed us to do half and half of their Chicago Classic and "The Lou"!  This worked out perfectly because we were able to try a slice of each and had one extra slice to choose which one we preferred! Both were good
