Little Goat Diner////Made it to little goat at 8:45 and just beat the rush. Terrific white chocolate and rosemary scone to start. Chai late had fine masala but felt like extra creamy and frothy. Ordered the paratha burrito and fat Elvis waffle with peanut butter and bacon maple syrup. Waffle was crispy and nicely done but Maple syrup with bacon on side became lard very soon and took away my appetite. Paratha burrito was a top notch. Everything was nice otherwise. Felt like home made for sure. Every dish had a different note to it. Definitely check out this spot.
