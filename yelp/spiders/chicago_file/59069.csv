Smoque BBQ////Brisket A+ spot on during 2 trips.  Go for the platter the bun is not needed.  Ribs B+ a little dry and could have been more tender but great flavor.   Pulled pork was A-very good.  Would have liked a few more pieces with bark.  Hand cut fries were awesome.  Cornbread very good as was slaw.   Only thing off were the beans. Good but had higher expectation given other food.  Beans needed either more brown sugar or a kick from rub.  Too middle of the road.  Love the vibe of the neighborhood.  We dined inside on one trip and outside the next.  Staff very friendly.   They move you through fast.  Very efficient.
