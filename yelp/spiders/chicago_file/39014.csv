Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We arrived on the main floor and checked in just a bit early with the host stand.  They directed us in to the bar and said they'd come find us when a table was ready. The main level is beautiful, bustling and full of friendly patrons.  A spot at the bar luckily opened as we walked up, so a Manhattan was quickly ordered.  As soon as we were served, a young lady approached us and said she had a table ready.  (I LOVE that you don't have a pager, card, etc, and they just know who you are from check-in) - oh and quick tip - this is a real whisky bar so you won't find things like Jack Daniels - go on with your Old Fashioned, Sazerac, Manhattan, etc...they were featuring multiple Old Fashioned's on their bar board...
