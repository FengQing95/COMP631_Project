Little Goat Diner////I recently discovered that putting beer in the freezer, while dangerous, is worth the risk.  There's cold and then there's ice cold.  As a matter of fact, our European friends at Heineken have stumbled on this truth and offer "Heineken Extra Cold" out on the continent.  I had the opportunity to sample this genius combination of beer plus extra cold while on a layover in Amsterdam recently.  Yes (thank you very much) extra cold is extra good.
