Smoque BBQ////An interesting sidebar I took a trip to Memphis for a few days in December 2015.  On my bucket list of places to go eat were "Gus World famous fried Chicken" (absolutely fabulous) and barbecue ribs as Memphis is known for that.  Maybe I chose the wrong place, but I found the ribs to be sadly lacking.  There are at least 1/2 dozen places in Chicago that I have eaten at that have better ribs
