Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We knew we wanted salad and pizza. We ordered the Malnati's salad, which was pleasantly surprising with the sweet vinaigrette and salami bits drizzled over big leafy greens and romaine lettuce. Not sure if we were just ravenous but it was an amazing salad we would be happy to order again. If you're not as hungry, I suggest ordering the smaller size that can serve 2-3 people. If you're very hungry, go for the family size that serves between 4-6 people. Then the Malnati Chicago classic deep dish pizza came! With my first bite, I was greeted by a thick doughy and cheesy goodness. As I was halfway through the slice, I noticed the dough got doughier, the cheese thicker and the meat meatier, which was heavy for my taste. I really wanted more tomato sauce than meat and cheese, but the tomato sauce seemed sparse. I think this was a great introduction to authentic Chicago deep dish, and I'd likely come back! Hopefully next time I'll try the one with more tomato sauce.
