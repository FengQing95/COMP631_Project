Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place not only has AMAZING food and sangria BUT their staff is amazing!!!!  I had a party of 17 for dinner reservations at 5:30...we were not able to be seated until a little after 6:00.  This was not their fault...there was a party there that had paid and sat for over 45min.  The manager and staff felt so bad that when we sat down there was pitchers of sangria waiting for us and also tons of appetizers (on the house).  We ordered tons and drank tons...the staff was wonderful and on it all night.  When we got our bill there was over $100 taken off our bill due to our inconvenience.  The food was FAB and we will all be coming back!!!  Thank you for a great night with our "ugly Christmas sweater" work party!!!
