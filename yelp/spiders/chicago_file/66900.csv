Little Goat Diner////my only beef is that basically everything on the menu is very rich, creamy, cheesy, etc. i take full responsibility for the fact that i am a weirdo who doesn't enjoy these things as much as most people. i loved it when we went to girl & the goat because i figured it was a once in a blue moon indulgence. here, since you CAN go more frequently, it would just be nice to see a few more dishes on the menu that people can eat without ingesting 2,000 calories. the food ITSELF is amazing, though. the sloppy goat is great and so are the "tacos" with goat meat. definitely give it a shot.
