Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Everything on the menu tastes unbelievably delicious. One of the best restaurants I've ever been to and the service is always incredible!! This is the only restaurant in the US where I've found tapas that are just as delicious as the ones in Spain. Definitely recommend the patatas bravas (spicy potatoes) here. The sangria is also always amazing and there's usually a seasonal flavor. This is one of the only restaurants in Chicago where I've been more than once and always look forward to coming back.
