Smoque BBQ////Absolutely the best smoked brisket I've ever had anywhere in the country! It's so tender it can be cut with a fork, and it's wonderfully flavorful.  So smoky!!!  The rub they use is also fantastic.  Then when you add the vinegar based bbq sauce, it's a combination of flavor made in heaven.
