Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm going to hold off on giving a pizza place in Chicago 5 stars until I've tried all the deep dishes in the area, but out of Gino's, Uno's (and Due), and Lou Malnati's, Lou Malnati's wins, hands down. I think the thing that stands out at Lou Malnati's is the fresh tasting tomato sauce and the crust. The crust was a perfect crispiness, and a good amount of it too (some places have too much crust and it's like eating bread with cheese).
