Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ate it nonetheless and got the caramelized banana for desert (yay yelp checkin!) The service got slow at the end but it could be due to having too many people? Not sure. But despite the fact we had some delicious tapas and my bf's a fan now so we'll be definitely exploring some different tapas places :)
