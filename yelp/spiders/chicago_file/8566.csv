Art Institute of Chicago////The one thing I did not like is you're not allowed to bring any liquids in, not even water, or any food, and there were not enough places to sit and rest. Â I like to sip liquid as I walk around, as I can otherwise get hot and dizzy, and don't want to have to seek out the cafe each time.
