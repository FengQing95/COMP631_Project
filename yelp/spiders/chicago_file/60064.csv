Smoque BBQ////I went with the 2-sides platter and chose fries and baked beans.  To me, sides play a pretty big role at a bbq joint and they delivered another 5/5..out.stan.ding!  Fries were hot and fresh, crispy on the outside steak type fries but not all "potato-y" like some steak fries tend to be, very flavorful!
