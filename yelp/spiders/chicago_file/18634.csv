Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////One of my favorite pizza places in the Chicagoland area. Both thin and deep dish are good. Plain cheese or the Lou are good. Cookie skillet pizza is good. It's just all sooo good. I've been to many locations and it's consistently good for dine in, take out or delivery. If you're in Chicago and haven't tried it yet, it's a must.
