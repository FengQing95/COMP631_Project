Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Second visit was for dinner on a warm, summer night. We sat outside on the patio and started off with a couple drinks. The passion fruit sangria was pretty good...though took a few glasses to get me tipsy. We ordered a variety of tapas (of which i would definitely say the meaty ones are worth ordering again!!). Overall, I would say the food is average. This place is more about sitting back, relaxing and enjoying good times with good friends.
