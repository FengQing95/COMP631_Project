Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The bread is amazing to start off with. The brussel sprouts salad is also delicious and a great appetizer. I shared the veggie Benedict with a friend and loved this fish. Very flavorful, and the patatas bravas are tasty and spicy. I also had the iberco ham hash, which was pretty yummy as well.
