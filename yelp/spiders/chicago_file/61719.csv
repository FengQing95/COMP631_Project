Smoque BBQ////As far as the food goes, AWESOME! Meat had great smoke flavor, ribs had good bark on it, didn't even need sauce. Slaw was freshly made and and not running the mill. Cornbread and Mac and cheese were a hit and to top it off the Peach Cobbler and (my fav) Bread Pudding were outstanding!
