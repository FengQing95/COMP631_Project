Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great restaurant.  Great steaks!  We had a terrific dinner at Bavette's.  Their ribeye was one of the best steaks ever.  The baked sweet potato was the bomb!  But the best thing about Bavette's is their corkage policy.  Bring up to 2 bottles of your own wine and pay no corkage as long as you share a glass from each with someone else in the restaurant.  What a cool idea!
