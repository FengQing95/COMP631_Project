Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Food was great, though! Bone marrow and foie appetizers, duh, delicious. Marrow came with these caramelized onions that Â tasted like candy. Excellent. Foie is pretty much the same as at Maude's and Au Cheval, so if you've been and you want to branch out, I'd say skip it. The surprise was the smoked whitefish Caesar salad, which was truly amazing. I would come back for that.
