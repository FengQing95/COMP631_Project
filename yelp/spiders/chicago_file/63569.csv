Smoque BBQ////I think the long lines at this new downtown location can be attributed to the novelty of having a BBQ place handy, and the fact that it DOES smell good (they must be pumping the smoke out into the restaurant, because very little actually gets into the meat).  But it IS overpriced ($8+ for less meat than you'd get in a decent burger) and my guess is that those lines will taper off pretty soon, once folks twig to that.  I'd gladly pay more for better BBQ, and while this isn't (exactly) a rip-off, it's definitely a case of getting LESS than you paid for....
