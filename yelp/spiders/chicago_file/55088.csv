Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////So why the 4 star review - it comes down to service and accommodating large groups.  I have only come here with groups of 12 (having now visited 5 or more times) and they have always been most helpful getting us served & seated on time.  The kitchen can manage orders with MANY tapas and still produce them without big waits between plates.  The servers are engaged, present and helpful (and the managers I have worked with have been VERY helpful).  I appreciate the work they do for their customers and have always left with a smile on my face.  I guess that to me speaks volumes.
