Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////So good! 8 of us went when groups of up to 10 were allowed at tables during the reopening from Covid 19 closures. The sangria was delicious and our waiter was great. Sometimes it felt like he wouldn't come by for a while which is why it's not a 5 star review. Get the spicy potatoes bravas!
