Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I visited this restaurant on Saturday and when I walked in to my table, there was a wet spot on the floor so naturally I slipped and fell to the ground. It happened to be exactly where the waiters/waitresses were standing retrieving other customer's bills. ALL of them looked at me on the ground like I was crazy and walked away, except for one. She stayed around after my husband helped me up from the floor and said "that's why you can't wear slippery shoes in here." I didn't get a "sorry" or "are you okay?" Instead I got a rude response. The shoes I was wearing are shoes I wear on a daily basis to work (and I am a teacher so I am on my feet all day on tile and wood floors- nothing VERY different from the restaurant floors). I was there with several other people and I was not the only one that day who slipped on these floors. Just a warning- make sure you wear rubber-soled, non-slip shoes when you visit.
