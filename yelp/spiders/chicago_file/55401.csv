Smoque BBQ////I spent three years in Chicago, desperately searching for a passable pork shoulder before my husband found Smoque.  I had heard about it a few times, but passed it off, since I had been burned by a few recommendations for "the best BBQ in Chicago" before.  You see, I'm not interested in ribs AT ALL.  I mean, okay, sometimes I like some ribs, but when I want barbecue, I really want pork shoulder.  I didn't realize that this was weird until I left Kentucky.
