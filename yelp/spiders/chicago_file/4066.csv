The Purple Pig////The wait was worth it!!! Out here in the Windy City for a work event, and came here to grab dinner. Everything was delicious, waiter was very attentive. We got the octopus, peas, broccoli, braised pork shoulder and secreto. Everything was very delicious! Flavors were very balanced. Nothing over powering another flavor. The portions are meant for family style, sharing. 5 dishes, 3 people. But be prepared to wait. So, grab a drink, wait, and enjoy!
