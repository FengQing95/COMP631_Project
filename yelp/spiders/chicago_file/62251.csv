Smoque BBQ////I was excited to try this place because of all the good reviews. I had the sliced brisket platter with beans and Mac and cheese. The briskets just melted in your mouth. The beans were also very good. The Mac and Cheese was out of this world amazing. I did not really enjoy the BBQ sauce. I've had better. Â But man if you go to this place make sure you get the Mac and cheese. It's a must!
