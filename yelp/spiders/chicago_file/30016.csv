Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////). I tried both a pepperoni and a sausage deep-dish pizza and they were delicious. The pizzas I had at home and the pizza I tried in the restaurant were very similar. I don't know if that's a good thing or bad thing considering how terrible I am in the kitchen (even with frozen food).
