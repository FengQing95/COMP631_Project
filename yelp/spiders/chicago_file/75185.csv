Little Goat Diner////We had their Macho Nachos and even with splitting the meal, we couldn't finish it.  It was darned good, their pulled pork is wonderful and the homemade chips are superb.  We both thought they could use a little heat in their mystery white sauce.  There were a few pickled jalapeños scattered about, but not enough for my liking.   All in all, wonderful food, wonderful service, wonderful coffee.  The wait was certainly acceptable for a top notch food place on a Saturday.   I love the interior of the building, too.  I'm not sure it's deco but it is certainly retro.  Great lines!
