Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My girlfriend and I had to go here after all the hype.  Turns out it was worth it because the pizza is excellent, the service is excellent and the price is right.  We beat the dinner rush (about 5:45 on Friday) so we got seated right away.  we got the stuffed spinach/chesse bread to start since the pizzas take 35 minutes to make and it was very good.  A small (9 inches) was more than enough for us but if you insist, get a medium.  The sausage was very good and so was the butter crust.
