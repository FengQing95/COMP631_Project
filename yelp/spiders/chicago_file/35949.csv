Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is probably one of the best steakhouses I've been to in Chicago. The environment was date friendly (wasn't extremely loud, nice seating, appropriately dimmed lighting). The food was amazing! I love crab cakes, i get them at almost every restaurant. This was hands down the best crab cake I've had (soooo much crab meat).
