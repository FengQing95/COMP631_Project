Little Goat Diner////We started with a few appetizers. The one that was most memorable was the fried pickles and onion rings. I'm not big on deep fried foods but the coating was delicate and crisp. It was really good. For my meal I ordered "Los Drowned", which is a sort of a mix between Italian Beef and French Dip. The meat is sliced thick, they add kimchi and pickled vegetables, and they serve as jus on the side. The meat in the sandwich could have been more spiced and there was not quite enough as jus. The kimchi and pickled veggies really added a lot though.
