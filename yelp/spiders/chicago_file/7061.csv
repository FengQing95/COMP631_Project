Art Institute of Chicago////I never fail to learn something or come away with a new appreciation when I visit the Art Institute.  If you are a tourist or somebody who doesn't get downtown much, you should plan on spending at least half a day here.  There is a lot to take in.  Your kids might enjoy looking at the medieval weapons. Be warned: you can't bring too much inside.  No flowers, no food, no big bags.
