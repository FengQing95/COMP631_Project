Art Institute of Chicago////I enjoy the museum and around the holidays, the Lion statues out front are decorated.  Also, if one of our sport teams are doing well, they are wearing a jersey or helmet.  I like the Modern wing more than the rest of the museum, however many of my favorite painters are represented in the main part, such as Archibald Montley Jr., "Dorian Grey' painting, 'American Gothic' and several more.
