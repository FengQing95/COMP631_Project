Art Institute of Chicago////It may be my all-time favorite art museum. Sure, there are a number of famous works, including "Starry Night" and "American Gothic," but the coolest parts of the museum are the less-traveled areas. The Art Institute always has some of the edgiest, most absurd (in a great way) modern art of all mediums, in big, airy rooms and halls that let the pieces breathe their own air. I could wander around this wing for hours.
