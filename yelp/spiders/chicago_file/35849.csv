Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As expected, place killed it.  The seafood tower was so fresh and honestly amazingly good. I got lamb chops, which only came with two and I wish there were 1-2 more bc they were so juicy and perfectly cooked!  Elote corn side was tasty and a unique side then just an original veggie. I left overly satisfied!! :). It's intentionally really dark in there with no windows in the case that's not ur thing but I didn't mind it!
