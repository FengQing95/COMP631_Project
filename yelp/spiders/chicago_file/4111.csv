The Purple Pig////I'm still dreaming about the food we had last week when we came in for lunch! We were walking along Michigan Avenue and came across The Purple Pig and decided to give it a try after seeing the thousands of wonderful reviews. The places opens at 11:30am and by 11:45am the place was filled so plan accordingly. We opted to sit at the bar to avoid the wait and it was equally as great. The hot dog with foie gras butter was out of this world. I mean what could be bad with foie gras?! The calamari was very light as it's not fried and quite refreshing. I'm already looking forward to my next visit.
