The Purple Pig////The highlights were definitely the chicken in the cacciatore, the asparagus in the salad, and the pasta was really good as a whole! The chicken fell off the bone and was extremely tender, the pasta was perfectly al dente, and everything in general was very flavorful. The portion sizes were fine and we spread out all the food across maybe two-ish meals each. They give you one salad box per person but everything else just comes in one container.
