Little Goat Diner////I love this place when it comes to casual dining at any time of the day. It can get a bit loud, so don't expect a quiet intimate environment. For breakfast, I would recommend the Parathas Burrito. I had the shrimp and cheesy grits, which were extremely watery and almost inedible. If you're into sweets for breakfast, then the cinnamon buns are amazing! Grab one before they run out. As far as sandwiches, my hands down favorite is the Rueben. It's a play on the traditional rueben with cooked kimchi in addition to sauerkraut. Pure genius. The Los Drowned and Pork Belly Pancake were also pretty decent.
