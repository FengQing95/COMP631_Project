Little Goat Diner////I will give kudos to Little Goat for a very creative menu and impressive medley of flavors for each dish. Brunch options are very original and were exciting to read about. Unfortunately, the execution turned out just average, like many other diners. Unlike many other diners this one has a very long wait and is one of the best reviewed in Chicago. What gives?
