Smoque BBQ////My favorite was probably their pulled pork, however comparing Smoque BBQ to Green St Smoked Meats, I would rather go to Green St Smoked Meats. The sliced brisket was good, but seem to be dry. Their chicken was well cooked, and the gumbo was delicious! If you want some kind of dessert get the peach cobbler, you won't be disappointed.
