Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I came here with my family (a party of 20+) on my birthday, and HUGE props to our waitress for being super patient with us. We started off with the Malnati salad, which was so delicious. I particularly enjoyed the combination of the mushrooms, salami, Gorgonzola cheese, and the sweet vinaigrette dressing. Other appetizers we got were the combination platter (mozzarella sticks, breaded mushrooms, zucchini), three-cheese bread, and the stuffed spinach bread. All of these were cheesy and filling, but looking back it at, I wish we didn't go so overboard because we underestimated our main course.
