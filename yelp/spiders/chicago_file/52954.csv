Smoque BBQ////So the next time comes around about a week later (Monday of this week 8-19). The order is the 1/2 slab baby back ribs, and the brisket and pulled pork sandwiches. the ribs were so so, a little dry and the flavor combination didn't work for me before adding the sauce. the brisket a little better. the taste was good without the sauce and slightly better with. the pulled pork by far was the best of the three. And no I'm not a fat, greedy pig. Â got the items for two people and we split the meals as it was her first time trying them too.
