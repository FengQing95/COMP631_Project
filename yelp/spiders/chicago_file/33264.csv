Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Definitely in my top 5 for Chicago restaurants. Bavette's is a very special place. I highly recommend the smoked whitefish caesar salad - it's wonderful, the crunch of the smoked crispy whitefish is unreal. The sourdough bread is to die for. I would have to say that the fried chicken was the fan favorite. I truly believe that you cannot go wrong here. Make sure to make your reservation well ahead of time, as it could be a month before you can get in. Also, the largest party size they take is a party of 6. All in all, Bavette's is stellar.
