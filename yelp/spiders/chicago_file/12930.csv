Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Glad we stopped here to try a deep dish pizza, prefer thin crust , but when in Rome....!  Hour and a half wait Sunday  night is fine,  but when the place is packed and I can't get to the bar, that is pushing it for me.  Especially when they only take cell numbers for groups of 6 or more for paging.   So..we decided to walk down to O'Leary's while we waited.  Came back an hour later just in time, waited maybe 5 minutes.  One thing that was nice, is they take your order when you register and start getting you pizza ready ahead, so once we were seated it was only a matter of 10-15 minutes!  Pizza was very good, and the large house salad really hit the spot.  Would go back!!
