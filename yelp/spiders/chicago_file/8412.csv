Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute of Chicago is one of the premier art museums in the U.S. I like almost everything about it: the building, the Michigan Avenue location, the lions outside the entrance, and of course, the art. I'm not crazy about the admission price - while access to art museums are getting steeper every time I turn around, it's worth it to view the incredible collection here.
