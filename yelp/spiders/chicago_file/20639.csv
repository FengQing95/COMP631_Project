Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Over the years there has been a TON of hype about Chicago style deep dish pizza. My family along with myself got together and went on a family reunion slash vacation to Chicago. One of the things that excited is the most was trying true deep-dish pizza. Honestly we were and are truly disappointed about what was put in front of us. The canned tomato sauce that was on top of a artificially butter flavored limp crust was watery and the whole thing lacked any depth of flavor. It was a true letdown. However while at this place we discovered the classic chopped salad. It was to die for! That salad is the only reason that this is above a one star review. We had a similar experience at giordanos--great salad terrible pizza!!!
