Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////4. On the plus side...I had the roasted chicken, which was delicious and surprisingly only $21. The bacon side was good, but not as good as a bacon side we'd enjoyed at David Burke's.  The Old Fashioned (Meade) was good.  The corn for which Bavette's is known was good. The shrimp appetizer was good. The bread, once we requested it, was excellent- crispy crust, soft inside and good sourdough kick. The broccoli was good, though I make it just as tasty at home (it's just roasted, though still yummy).
