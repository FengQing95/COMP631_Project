Little Goat Diner////Firstly, the only thing that makes Little Goat a diner is maybe 30% of the decor and the fact that they call themselves a diner. But when I think of diners I think greasy food that you can often only stomach when drunk. This place was anything but.  The food was fantastic.  I could taste the flavors and items that should have been greasy weren't greasy. I ordered the apple pancakes, farm bacon, tempura mash, and croque monster to share with a friend.  We also had a side of grits and ordered a chocolate shake.  The bill was about $47 and we enjoyed all of the flavors.  They also have a special syrup that's aged in red wine barrels and taste like delicious syrup aged in red wine barrels.  There's no hype.  The combinations work and everything was decadent and amazing. Also the music was incredible.  We were singing along, mouths full to all of the tracks! It's clean and cozy and our waiter, JP, was the best! We will definitely go back again.
