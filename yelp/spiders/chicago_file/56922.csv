Smoque BBQ////All jokes aside (wait, that wasn't actually a joke), Smoque consistently delivers some really, really good smoked meats. The brisket and the sausage are the unquestioned stars at Smoque. Other than the brisket chili, the sides are nothing to write home about, but only a fool would judge a barbecue spot based on the sides.
