Smoque BBQ////A small group stopped in for takeout (thank goodness, because at 8PM on a Tuesday night, every table was still filled!).  I had the Brisket and a side of slaw.  It was as delicious as I expected.  I don't know if I would eat there, as it's pretty small and very crowded with the line winding right through the middle of the dining area, but take out?  For sure.
