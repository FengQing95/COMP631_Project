The Purple Pig////We ordered dessert- a chocolate, lime +matcha, banana bombe and a Sicilian Iris. They were both mediocre. The lime was too strong and the Sicilian Iris had an excellent exterior texture..but the inside was undercooked..I don't know if it was the dough or the cheese..but there was something stringy in the filing.
