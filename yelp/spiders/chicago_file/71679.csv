Little Goat Diner////It's time I reviewed Little Goat since I've eaten there on three different occasions and keep bringing people with me to try it! I love this place with the diner feel and the New American fare, it weds yesteryear with nouveau in a tasteful array of menu choices. Each visit I've tried something different and keep enjoying each offering. The bullseye french toast is a complex of flavors and textures that I wondered if I'd like and was pleasantly pleased by it. The barbecue maple syrup was a perfect compliment to the chicken pieces and french toast. The root vegetables side dish is wonderful so I've ordered it each time I've visited. Most recently I enjoyed the ramen wrapped shrimp cocktail and couldn't finish it due to the size of the shrimp! So filling and what fantastic flavors!
