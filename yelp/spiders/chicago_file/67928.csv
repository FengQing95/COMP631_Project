Little Goat Diner////I have been hoping to get to this spot for a while since I am a huge fan of the Girl and the Goat.  We just walked in off the street without a wait after going to the Randolph St. Fest last weekend.  I ordered the fish tostadas and my sister ordered the french toast with an egg in the middle and crispy chicken on top.  The food was very good and an interesting twist on the average diner food.
