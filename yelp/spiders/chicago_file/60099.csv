Smoque BBQ////I haven't had an issue ordering immediately on off hours. On the other hand, I've been in line for quite some time on weekends and during lunch hours. Regardless of the wait, the food is simply outstanding. I haven't been able to favor one item over another because all of them have been amazing. Have also had the pleasure to meeting the owner who was incredibly polite and pleasant to meet....which makes this establishment that much more memorable.
