Smoque BBQ////This place is barbeque heaven. I ordered the beef brisket sandwich. The brisket was juicy and absolutely perfect. I love that we were given a side of two different barbeque sauces (smoky and sweeter). It came with cole slaw and a side. Â When it comes to the sides, we only tried the mac and cheese and fries...both were delicious.
