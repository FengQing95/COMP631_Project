The Purple Pig////Most of their dishes were delicate and great. Our favorites were their roasted bone marrow with herbs and fried pig ear. The roasted bone marrow was awesome with grilled brioche came with order but kind of greasy if you try it alone. Fried pig ear with fried kale was crispy and amazingly delicious to dip in egg yolk before eating. We didn't recommend their milk braised pork shoulder since it was little dry inside.
