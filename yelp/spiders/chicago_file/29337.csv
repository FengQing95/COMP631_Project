Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was determined to eat some Chicago deep dish on my most recent trip. Our shuttle driver said that Lou Malnati's was the place to go. I also overheard a fellow conference goer talking about his experience and he recommended to go here. I was originally planning on a different pizza shop, but changed my mind after hearing this place recommended twice.
