Art Institute of Chicago////You come to miss easy access to great art when you leave Chicago, and the AI and public art is something I sorely miss from my days of working downtown. This is a real treat if you're just a visitor and if you're a local, make the excuse to leave early or come in on the weekend and revisit the AI. I deduct one star for the unreasonably high admission fee (which as someone else said used to be "pay what you can" but is now more "pay what we say") and the nickel-and-diming on special exhibit pricing.
