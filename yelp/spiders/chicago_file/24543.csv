Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I want to add that maybe I had a poor experience because I was brought upstairs to a weird/shady area of the restaurant instead of in the main area. There was also a separate kitchen catering to the top floor. 2 of my friends found weird stuff in their soda too... So maybe just avoid going upstairs at Lou's.
