Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Can't find anything bad to say about this place or the food they serve. EXCELLENT in all ways possible. Worth the hike from Downtown Chicago for sure...The service was very friendly despite having to deal with a large table of 15 people...Wish I could list everything I ate here..but safe to say whatever you pick you will enjoy it...especially the bacon wrapped shrimp, the goat cheese/bread and of course the yummy yummy paella. Can't wait to go here again !!!
