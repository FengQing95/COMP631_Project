Little Goat Diner////One of my fav places. Will always look forward to coming here. This particular time was great because i went with my fam and we were all hungry and on a time crunch. Service was a little slow at the beginning so we got antsy! But then our server #SHANE came back to us like ah so sorry to have kept you waiting!!! I will buy you dessert!! :) and her aura thru the remainder of the meal was PERF! so overall Shane is just totally a winner to me and her communication skills are fabulous and very very valuable...... and the #FISHTOSTADAS are a new fav!!!!!! :} keep on!
