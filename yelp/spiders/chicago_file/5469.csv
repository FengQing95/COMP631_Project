The Purple Pig////We had a birthday celebration at this place. Cool place and nice dishes. Hard to get reservation, especially with limited seating now. Wine collection is good, so are their cocktails. Ordered Pig's ear and Fried Brussel Sprout Leaves. Pig's ear were a little salty for my taste, but Bruss was incredible. Chicken Kabob was good, nicely cooked and juicy and the side of smashed potatoes was really good. Gyro and Pork belly glaze were just okay. Overall I would say nice place to dine and good food.
