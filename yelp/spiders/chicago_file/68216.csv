Little Goat Diner////Why did we not come here earlier, knowing how much we love Girl and a Goat?? Spoiler alert: although everything sounds delicious (and it is!), beware of the large portion sizes! We drank: capuccino (Dark Matter coffee, excellent choice of beans!) and ginger beer (light and refreshing on hot summer days). I ate: blueplate special - baguette toast topped with smoked salmon cream cheese, flaked salmon (why not double up on salmon when you can?!), 2 sunny side up eggs and a refreshing arugula blueberry salad to balance it all off; it was exactly what I wanted - healthy spin on egg breakfast. Loved the flavor and texture combo, wouldn't chabge a thing. Husband had: Goat burger - OMG. This is a humongous 3 meat burger with pickles, amazing onion rings, crispy corn chip and God knows what else. Perfect bun, great tangy mayo dressing, everything was simply amazing (I had to help him finish it..). Could not resists trying the pork belly (yessss!) home fries - do I really need to comment? Deep fried perfectly crunchy outside, soft melting in your mouth inside chuncks of potato topped with some cilantro (never hurts!), pieces of delish pork belly and a great dressing. Almost forgot, I alsohad a cup of watermelon gazpacho with feta crema - not too sweet, perfectly balanced with tomato, cilantro and a bit of jalapeno. Perfect and refreshing soup of the day for summer. We rarely take home leftovers, but we definitely outdid ourselves this time and had to take some food home. In summary: come hungry, don't fill up on coffee before food comes, bring friends to share (especially if you want to try more than one dish, which you def should!). Enjoy! Worth the wait.
