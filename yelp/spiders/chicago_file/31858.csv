Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I enjoyed both places but Lou Malnati's was a little better to me because I enjoyed their crust more. It was tastier and didn't fall apart with all of that heavy, deep dish action on top of it like my pizza from Pizzeria Uno's did. My Baby and I got some cheese bread from here as an appetizer and it was spectacular. Cheese bread is one of those simple dishes that doesn't always get prepared with the proper love and respect it deserves but Lou's did just that.
