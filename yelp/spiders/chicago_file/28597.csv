Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great pizza! But, I never got my cup of spinach tortellini soup. I think Marco was looking out for me. I didn't need it. Â It's all about the pizza. The crust was awesome. I didn't even go for the butter crust. The service was good enough, young kid, kind of a distracted waiter situation. I've gotta say the personal size pizza looked small, but doesn't feel anywhere near small in my stomach. Perfectly cooked, great sauce, perfect balance of cheese, great tomatoes, and crispy crunchy tasty crust!
