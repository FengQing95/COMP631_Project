Little Goat Diner////Service is always great and the servers provide excellent suggestions and descriptions of each dish. The decor perfectly complements the food and the room warms up (not temperature-wise) when the sun's out thanks to the large windows enclosing the atrium, both on the side of the building and in the ceiling.
