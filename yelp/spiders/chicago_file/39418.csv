Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Ordered a Filet (they ran out of bone in WTF!!), garlic shrimp, & mashed potatoes. The food was cooked perfectly. The drinks were ok. Our waitress was really nice. I'd love to go back, but they need to figure out how to accomodate larger parties. Lost a star 4 that because they were unconcerned w/accommodations for my group.
