Little Goat Diner////My husband and I went here for lunch. Food was so-so. Veggie quesadillas were decent. Patty melt was blah. Service was poor. The server never asked how are food was or if we needed anything. We barely had our glasses refilled with water. With so many options in that neighborhood, I'm definitely not coming back.
