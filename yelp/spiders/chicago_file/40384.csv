Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My friend and I started with the Tenderloin Steak Tartare. Then for the main course we had the Dry-Aged Bone in New York Strip and the Dry-Aged Bone in Ribeye. Enhanced with Gorgonzola and roasted Bone Marrow. As for the sides, we had Broiled Asparagus, Mashed Potatoes, and Truffle Mac & Cheese.
