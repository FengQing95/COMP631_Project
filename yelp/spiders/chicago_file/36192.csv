Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The service started off slow, however our server apologized several times and made up for it. Everything we ordered was phenomenal! Started off with large, thick slices of warm sourdough bread. We shared the fries with garlic aioli, the short rib stroganoff and the spicy fried chicken. Be sure to make reservations though! It was packed on a Sunday night.
