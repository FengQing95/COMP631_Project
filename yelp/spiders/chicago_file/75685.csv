Little Goat Diner////The food was quite delicious! I had a breakfast dish with a Korea twist that was very good. My MIL got the giant burger they have. (I cannot remember the name of it.) Everything was very good. The service was okay, not terrible, not out of this world. My Bloody Mary (spicy) was tasty, not the best I've ever had, but I'd definitely go back.
