Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I see why this restaurant has such a long and rich history in Chicago, because it is truly outstanding. My friend and I came for brunch recently, and really loved our experience here. Making reservations was easy since they are on Open Table, and I was able to snag us a table the day before our Saturday brunch. During brunch you have the options of choosing between the brunch items, or the dinner items on the other side of the menu. The fact that there are so many options is dangerous, because everything sounds delicious. I decided to focus on items from the brunch menu, because I know I'll come another time to try the dinner items.
