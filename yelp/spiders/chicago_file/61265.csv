Smoque BBQ////The only barbecue I'll even touch in the city.  I've gotten so many of my family and friends hooked on this place.  The ribs are beyond tender, the mac & cheese is the to die for,  the brisket just melts in your mouth.  I don't even enjoy beans and I could live off of theirs. And the best part of the whole experience is no matter how many times you wash your hands, they will still smell like smoqued meat the entire day (only making your wish you had more food).
