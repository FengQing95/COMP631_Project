Smoque BBQ////This place is nothing fancy.  It's on the corner of a busy intersection and is a typical Chicago style diner.  There is indoor and outdoor seating and the busboys help you find a table.  We went on a Saturday at 4 p.m. and had no trouble getting a seat.  I ordered the sliced brisket with sides of cole salad,  peach cobbler and cornbread.  The cobbler and corn bread are baked in these little tins and are absolutely divine.  The meat literally melts in your mouth.  I got all of this food- which I couldn't finish- for $8.95.
