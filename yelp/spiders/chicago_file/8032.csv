Art Institute of Chicago////I was really disappointed with my trip here. I'm a teacher from out of state and looked up online that public school teachers received free entry. So on my vacation to Chicago I visited, with a CPS teacher friend, and showed my teacher ID. The first person we spoke to said we have to go to the other end of the museum to get an Educator's Pass, even though we just wanted free entry one time. Then, we spoke to the woman who takes tickets and she said we didn't need the pass. When we went back to the first man, he said she was mistaken. So, we walked all the way to the other side of the museum and asked for Educator Passes. At this point, this man told us out of state teachers actually don't get in for free. The frustrating part is that we had mentioned that I was visiting from out of Illinois and no one said anything to us on our whole search. It was difficult to talk to all of these different museum employees who clearly were not on the same page about the policies. We were so frustrated and tired from talking to so many people and trying to get in that we just decided not to visit the museum. Had I known the policy clearly from the beginning, I think I would have been fine. But we just spoke to so many people that were uninformed and that made the experience pretty terrible.
