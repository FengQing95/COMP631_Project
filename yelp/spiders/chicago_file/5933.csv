The Purple Pig////We are blown away by all the dishes and all the flavors that typically wouldn't go together but definitely work in the best way. We ordered the house made hot dog with foie gras butter, passion fruit mustard, and black truffle, the hamachi collar with yellow tomato bbq ,romesco, and sweet pepper salpicon, and burrata cannoli with peaches, Olive Carmel and heirloom tomatoes. Every single dish was absolutely delicious and unique in its own right. The hot dog meat was really satisfying with quality meat paired with some serious flavors. The hamachi collar was served in fried form but it was still very light as an overall dish. The burrata cannoli was a nice balance of whipped burrata balanced by the peaches and tomatoes.
