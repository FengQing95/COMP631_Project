Smoque BBQ////my most recent visit to smoque was by far the best, my bf and i ordered and enjoyed our yummy brisket. When it was time to leave, a worker noticed and offered to get me to go dishes for my food and also noticed Ryan went back in line to bring some home for his parents. He told ryan to sit down and he can get it for him, he took his order and came back 5 minutes later with the food all ready to go!
