Little Goat Diner////For food we had the goat burger bahn mi, the shrimp and grits, club sandwich, and the smoked fries.  The goat burger was mediocre especially for the price.  The flavors were overpowered with acid, there was no salty pate or ham, there was no real fresh herb flavor, it was just goat and pickled acidity.  I've had lamb burgers throughout the city that are head and shoulders better and at a better price.  The burgers here are all around 13 dollars with no sides which is a little ridiculous.  For overall burger experience shake shack even kicks this places ass.
