Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////In Chicago on vacation and was extended an invitation to join a group at this establishment. One word, yum. We ordered the shrimp with garlic, olive oil and red pepper flakes, a beef empanada, the rioja braised short rib with manchego mashed potatoes and baby root vegetables and the paella valenciana with roasted pork, txistorra sausage and braised pork belly. Every thing was flavorful and delicious. Our server was attentive, our food arrived promptly and my party and I left full, satisfied and ready for a stroll around Navy Pier. When I return to Chicago you will find me at Caf√© Ba-Ba-Reeba
