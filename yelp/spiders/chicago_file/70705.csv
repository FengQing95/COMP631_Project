Little Goat Diner////Little goat is so stinkin cute. If you go during an off time (maybe around 3 or so) there won't even be a wait. Prices were extremely reasonable and the menu was different and great. I got on sandwich on the bread and we shared fries. I would say it is definitely more diner/comfort food and worth every calorie.
