Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I did not try the pepperoni pizza, so I will comment just on mine, the Lou. It had a good taste and mouth feel, and I liked the spinach/garlic/cheese blend. What I didnt love though, was that it did not remind of me of real deep dish pizza. And I know that Lou Malnati's is not necessarily known for the deepest dish, but I was disappointed in the deepness of the individual pizza. We saw several smalls and mediums come out that looked much deeper. To be fair, the server did recommend a small instead of the 2 individuals. He said you get the same amount of pizza, and its cheaper, but since we had such different topping interests, we settled for individuals.
