Little Goat Diner////How could I resist the Everything is Everything Crumpets? My mouth was full of flavors and textures! I was not ready. Such a fun, colorful dish. Crumpet had a consistency that was a mix between a biscuit/croissant and pancake. T'was lovely. I also got a side of brussel sprouts that had crispy onions and toasted almonds.
