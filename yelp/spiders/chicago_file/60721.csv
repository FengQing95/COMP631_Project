Smoque BBQ////DISCLAIMER: Portage Park restaurants get 4 and 5 stars all the time like they are government cheese. I believe this is due to the niceness of the residents of this area. The sad truth is that Portage Park has very few dining options that will make you salivate. Do not believe all the superb ratings. I would go by the worst review of any given place. I am all for dives, chains, and fancy places. It all depends on your mood. But one thing I look for is good quality for a decent price.
