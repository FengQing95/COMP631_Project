Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It was worth the wait. I got the Lou's Deep Dish, in going with my policy that a dish good enough to name a restaurant after is probably a safe bet. This was one delicious pie! However, the surprise favorite of the meal may have been the bruschetta appetizer. It is everything you want in a bruschetta: perfectly crunchy garlic bread and fresh flavorful tomatoes topped with delicious parmesan cheese and herbs. Just perfection. Great food all around.
