Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My friend recently gifted my in frozen, shipped Lou Malnati pizza for helping her out during a busy month at work. Jokes on her because I would've done it for free because I love her but DANG I forgot how good Lou's was. To be fair, my family is full of Giordano's purists, but a blind taste test put them to shame. I think the sauce is slightly sweeter or maybe just not as acidic, which I enjoy. The crust is also very crumbly with good flavor. I am not describing it well at all ,but just take my word for it when I say its delicious. I also think its pretty cost effective having it shipped. I am in jersey, no where near Chicago so I figured it'd be very expensive, but if you purchase 6 you get each one for $20 - pretty good deal if you ask me. Keep in mind these bad boys feel 2-3 people.
