Little Goat Diner////The food doesn't live up to any high expectations or remotely compare to the Girl & the Goat (though it supposed to be the casual diner version, no reservations required). The parathas burrito & fish tostada are both lackluster and on the bland side. The mac & cheese side is decent, but nothing special. The smoked bacon and toffee shake sounded more interesting than it was. It's a decent toffee flavored milkshake, but also not very flavorful, which describes a lot of their dishes. The best thing about dining here is the service, which is spectacular.
