The Purple Pig////Able to finally make it in to the Purple Pig. Small plate sharing at its finest. Three of us shared a great selection of goodness. Started with Salt-Roasted Wi/ Whipped Goat Cheese + Pistachio Butter. These were so good. Would definitely get this again. Sweetness offset by the cheese and butter.  Had a hard time being gracious and letting the others have seconds of this. The Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder w/ Mashed Potatoes + Crispy Lentils was like home cooking. Almost a hash taste to the pork. The ricotta gnocchi w/ bolognese was cooked perfectly and definitely also one of my favorites. Octopus  is always a favorite. This was cooked well but something overtook the natural good taste of the octopus. Couldn't put my finger on it. Guess I'm a fan of more simple grilled octopus dishes. So many more great options I wanted to try. Definitely will be back!  No reservations so best to try slightly off peak or with a small group to fit in at one of the larger tables.
