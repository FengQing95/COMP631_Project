Smoque BBQ////I think we must've walked in at just the right moment because as soon as we sat down, the line had stretched all the way out the door.  The good news is that these guys crank it out so even if you do have to wait, it's not for long.  But that also applies to you so just know that this is not a place to linger.  It's just understood that you are expected to get up the immediately after you've finished.  Understandable, though.
