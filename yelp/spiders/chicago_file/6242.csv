The Purple Pig////The place was pretty crowded and our waitress was very helpful in selecting the dishes. We started with the Pumpkin carrot soup which was a special item. It tasted pretty good. Next item that we ordered was the hummus and focaccia. The portion size was pretty large. The focaccia was tasty and was dripping with butter/olive oil. I think it was a bit too much. Then came the fried manchego which was presented beautifully and tasted good. We then ordered the salt-roasted beets which was again a decent portion size. It was topped with pistachios and was served with delicious pistachio butter.
