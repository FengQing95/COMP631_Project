Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I am Lou's backer all the way. Once in awhile, small neighborhood joints open, replace my love for Lou, and then I get tired as a hell of waiting an hour and a half for them to perform their magic. Lou ALWAYS comes through. This is also the best Lou's in my opinion. The waitstaff is friendly, especially with tourists. Â The establishment itself gives a happy air, and the food, well, welcome to some good pizza.
