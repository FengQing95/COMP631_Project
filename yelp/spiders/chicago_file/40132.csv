Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Still our favorite high-end restaurant in the city. We dined outside during COVID and the food and service wowed us again. Great care was taken for cleanliness, distancing, etc. We ordered far too much food for two people, but that's the way it goes here! The complimentary house bread sounds underwhelming given the menu here, but it's from a great local bakery and is worth trying. The wedge salad is phenomenal, if for no other reason than it comes with their great bacon. Tried the shrimp scampi this time and it was great as well - very decadent and rich. The steaks were great as always. My wife got the filet and it was perfectly cooked and cut like butter. I got the steak frites for the first time and it was incredible, and a great value to boot. The frites come with garlic aioli like you'd get at Small Cheval. For a side, we got the truffle mac with bacon added and it was the out of this world delicious and over the top. As always, got the chocolate cream pie to go so we could eat it when we weren't busting at the seams.
