Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We got Lou's delivered to the office for a welcoming event for new hires. The food was here right on time and the delivery guy was nice enough to come to the seventh floor to leave the pizzas here. They gave us plenty of plates and utensils, as well as dressing for the salad and parmesan and crushed red pepper flakes for the pizza.
