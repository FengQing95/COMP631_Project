Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////They do have happy hour from 4-6pm for those on a budget! Pintxos are $1 and selected tapas are $3 each.  Overall it was a hip place to be and if you enjoy variety and don't mind spending the money, this is your place!  They have great service and great drinks. We got the mango sangria and it was delicious!
