Art Institute of Chicago////You cannot ask for a better location between Millennium Park and Grant Park. A great place to escape the cold (and learn something) in the winter and perfect way to spend an afternoon any time of year. Even if you are not an art aficionado you will find something to appreciate in this renown museum, even if it's just the much photographed lions outside the main entrance!
