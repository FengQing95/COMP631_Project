Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I got there a little after 1pm. It was busy but not crazy in the restaurant. But the staff still seemed frazzled. (maybe lunch rush was crazy right before) I waited at the cash register about 10 minutes with only 2 other people waiting and 3 staff standing by the register talking. 2 or 3 more people come in and were a bit more pushy and the hostesses helped them over the couple of us already waiting, which wasn't super fair.
