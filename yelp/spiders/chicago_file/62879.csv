Smoque BBQ////I had the 1/2 chicken with the brisket chili and french fries and my BF had the Kansas City ribs, mac n cheese and beans. He really enjoyed his ribs and thought it was a great portion. I like the vinegar coleslaw that comes with the order as well. All in all it was a good meal - i suppose. Not some place I will come rushing back to.
