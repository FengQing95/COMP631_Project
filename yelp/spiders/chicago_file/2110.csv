Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I went here two times over two days which should speak volumes about how much I liked this place.  Both times, I went for breakfast and I had their signature berry bliss pancakes which were phenomenal.  The berries and the glazes provided enough sweetness where I didn't really need the syrup.  But it wasn't overly sweet.  I had a side of the hashbrowns which worked out well because I needed something savory to balance out the pancakes.
