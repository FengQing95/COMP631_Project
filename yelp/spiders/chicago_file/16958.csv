Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////OMG Lou! This is by far my favorite pizza in Chicago. I didn't used to be a fan of deep dish pizza until I tried this place. PHENOMENAL. It's the perfect combination of sauce, meat and cheese. And I also really enjoy their salads. The service is pretty good and the atmosphere has a good vibe.
