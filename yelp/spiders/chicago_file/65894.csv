Smoque BBQ////Not much can be said that hasn't already.  Smoque is where its at.  Unfortunately for my waistline, this location is by my house and their downtown location is by my office, so you can imagine I order this way too much.  Sliced brisket is amazing, brisket chili is a great side, and both dessert options (peach cobbler and bread pudding) are wonderful.  Bread pudding especially...whew.
