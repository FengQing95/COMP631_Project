Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The deep dish was really good.  I loved the tomatoes and sausage that comes on the pizza.  I'm not usually a crust person but this buttery crispy crust was outstanding.  There was a thick layer of cheese and for me it was just a little too much.  This was definitely a delicious pizza and I see why it's one of the most popular deep dish places in Chicago.
