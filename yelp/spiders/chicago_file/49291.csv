Smoque BBQ////For the sides I had coleslaw, beans and fries. All of which were very good. The beans were smokey with quite a bit of bacon bits and the coleslaw was actually excellent. It was my favorite side. The slaw was not the creamy kind you normally get from BBQ restaurants, it was tangy and refreshing. The fries were also good but honestly I don't really care too much about the difference between fries as long as they're crispy and tasty.
