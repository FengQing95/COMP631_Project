Little Goat Diner////We started with the goat chili cheese fries- yeah, I could die happy eating these. The fries alone are salty and crispy, but when you add the cheese sauce and goat chili it's heaven. We also had the crab dip as an appetizer- so creamy and cheesy, and the ritz crackers are a very nostalgic taste for me.
