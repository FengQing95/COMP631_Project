Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Love this restaurant so much! Great food and the best sangria! My only reason for not putting 5 stars is that our server Velibor was staring at our table and shaking his head clearly annoyed we were finishing our second pitcher of sangria and chatting. Advice for the future-if a couple of girls are sitting and drinking and chatting just ask us if we'd be open to move to the bar-we would have much rather sat at a table at the bar and kept drinking than have our server glaring at us. That's my only complaint-otherwise I love this place & will be back for more bacon wrapped dates :)
