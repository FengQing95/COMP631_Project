Little Goat Diner////Little Goat Diner is a relatively good iteration from Girl & the Goat. The essence is to take the traditional diner experience and infuse it with adventurous culinary ideas. That said, I recommend staying closer to classic diner foods. I ordered the smoked corn beef hash with eggs, prepared sunny side up along with a chocolate milk. The corned beef was plentiful and actually infused with a smokey taste. The eggs were classic in their style, fried and runny over the thin, crispy hash browns, onions, and accompanied by bits of corned beef. The chocolate milk was so-so, not sure I would order it again.
