Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The drinks are nice, though somewhat typical of todays "craft movement" trend. And the desserts are worth a try, especially the home made and huge slices of pie. Finally a special nod to the house made sour dough bread which is served gratis as massively thick slabs... it is among the best bread in the city.
