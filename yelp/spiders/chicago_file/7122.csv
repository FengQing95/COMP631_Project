Art Institute of Chicago////I first fell in love with art when I saw a reproduction of Nighthawks by Edward Hopper, but you don't know what you're missing until you see the real thing in person. You can find the real deal here. What I love about the Art Institute that I *always* see something new when I go, even after twenty years. Their collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist paintings is a big draw. There's always a crowd in front of La Grand Jatte, of course (thanks to Ferris Bueller), but don't miss their collection of Monet haystacks - there's at least five. I also love their collection of modern art - their surrealism galleries are outstanding! My only complaint is that the photography galleries are relegated to the basement - almost like an afterthought. A must see for art lovers.
