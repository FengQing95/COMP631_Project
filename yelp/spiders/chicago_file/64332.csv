Smoque BBQ////My BF is originally from Texas, and one of the drawbacks for him is that there is no good BBQ in Chicago, or Illinois for that matter.  The flip side for me is there is no good pizza or italian in Texas.  A coworker recommended Smoque, claiming it was the best BBQ they've had in the midwest.  I checked it out on Yelp, and it seems the consesus is this is the best in Chicago.
