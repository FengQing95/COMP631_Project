Smoque BBQ////A portly man (I'm going to talk about him some more in a bit) was less impressed than I was. He asked someone, probably the owner, if the restaurant could be expanded. He even suggested that the business next door be bought out (he was politely told that it's hard to buy out a dentist's office). Â
