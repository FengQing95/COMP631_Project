Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The small Lou's was a good size for a sample of deep dish pizza as we planned to have other small bites throughout the evening! The crust was cooked to perfection and tasted better than expected! The order was ready on time and the website was easy to navigate. Each pizza slice was quite filling so a small would be plenty for 2 for a meal! Very impressed with Lou's and appreciate them having so many locations making it easy to visit any time!
