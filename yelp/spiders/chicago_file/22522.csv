Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Aside from UNOs this was the only other Chicago deep dish style pizza I had time to try. I'm sure there are others out there! But this was on my list so I gave it a shot. I shared a Small Malnatis Classic with sausage cheese and tomatoes. Pros: The portion is more than enough for 2 people, the cheese has a perfect chewy consistency, and the tomatoes are fresh and flavorful. Great service. Con: The hard buttermilk crust wasn't that good and the overall flavor is powerful yet nothing special. Maybe I just prefer NY thin crust..
