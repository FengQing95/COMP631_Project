Art Institute of Chicago////There's no need to restate all the positive comments about this museum; they are all true. I, personally, was stunned by the extent of this museum and it's true that it rivals the Met in NYC. All the exhibits were extremely well curated and overall I was pleased by the diversity of the collections so there's something for everyone's taste in art. Plan on spending several hours here if you want to take in the whole thing.
