Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Amazing logistics - place was packed, hostess said 30 minutes - didn't believe her. They suggested we order ahead since deep dish can take up to an hour. We waited 17 minutes, were seated and had our phenomenal pizza within 45 minutes. Close competition with lefty's in San Diego cause we're known for our pizza and fish tacos!
