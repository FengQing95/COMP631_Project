Smoque BBQ////I was here about 2 1/2 years ago with a friend. The line is super long but the food is great! Authentic food and great drinks. It was a very hot day so we had the tea and it was great. They serve cafeteria-style, which adds to the authentic appeal. I was pleased and would come back. A great place for people who have big appetites and enjoy flavorful southern food!
