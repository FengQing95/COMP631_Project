Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I am absolutely in love with this place! It is always very very busy even early on a weeknight, so be sure to make a reservation. My recommendation would be first of all to order a pitcher of your favorite sangria flavor and sip on this while looking at the menu because this is going to take awhile. There are so many delicious options! My favorite thing to do is go with a smaller group of around 4 and order a variety. The last time my friends and I went we each went around and ordered one appetizer and kept ordering throughout the night until we were full! This was a great way to try a variety of items on the menu without filling up to fast. And in short, this is why it is a tapas restaurant. My favorite things to order are the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, Grilled Ibérico Pork, and  Rioja-Braised Short Rib. So much flavor in each bite! Can't wait to come back!
