Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Burrata with Catalan Tomato Bread and Goat Cheese Baked in Tomato Sauce was delicious. Brussels Sprouts Salad was surprisingly good. I usually don't like raw brussels sprouts, but I enjoyed this salad. The Octopus a la Plancha was pretty mediocre, which I found surprising considering that I love octopus and I expected them to knock this one out of the park. The Shrimp with Garlic, Olive Oil, Red Pepper Flakes on the other hand was delicious, and I think we went with 2 or 3 orders of this. I'm not a fan of blue cheese but the others at my table enjoyed the Beef Tenderloin & Blue Cheese. The Grilled Hanger Steak was also a hit among us. Someone ordered a Beef Empanada and really liked it.
