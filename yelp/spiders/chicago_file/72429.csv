Little Goat Diner////I probably don't need to add to the raves here - but can't help it. Seriously everything on the menu is delicious!! I am obsessed with their chickpea salad - sooo good! Try to head there during off hours if possible though because the wait can be nuts during peak! Totally worth it though if you have time to kill.
