The Purple Pig////My party and I came around 7pm on a Saturday night and were quoted a two hour wait for a table in the dining area. Instead of waiting that long, we opted to order on the outside patio, where the full menu is available. Be warned, there are no chairs to accompany the tables; however, the wait time for food was not that long, so its bearable.
