Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We started with the Lou's bruschetta ($6.25). It was very good. The ingredients were flavorful and bread crunchy. Â We also ordered two deep dish pizzas. A medium pan classic Chicago ($17.95)... Six slices. You have I enjoy meat to like this pizza cause there is a layer if sausage on top. We also got the small pan the Lou ($14.96) and felt this was a better choice for us because it had veggies. There were four slices to share. We had a lot of leftovers.
