Little Goat Diner////I love this place, It's amazing, To me this Diner represents love, I feel it when I walk in. I can even feel love in the food... Love is also within the Diner's interior. The color's throughout the diner, composition of table's and the light fixture's and I love the circle window on the south wall of the kitchen. Everything is branded beautifully.
