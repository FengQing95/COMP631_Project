Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Steak was a let down and overpriced. I ordered the 42 day dry aged ribeye, charred broccoli, and truffle Mac and cheese.  First of all, the steak was cooked perfectly medium rare with a nice crusty exterior and warm pink center.  However, the flavor of the steak was lacking. I really expected a beefier flavor but it didn't taste any better than the choice grade steaks I cook at home. The dry aging did increase the tenderness but did not add anything in the way of flavor which was disappointing.  Save yourself some money and go to mastro's for a cheaper more flavorful steak.  Also the sides we're good but nothing special and a bit overpriced as well.  The purple pig and girl and the goat had way more  complex and balanced veggie dishes and sides compared to Bavette's.  Lastly, I will say that the service was excellent.  The bartender and servers were very knowledgeable and accommodating. I just wish the food was better.
