The Purple Pig////In town for biz and stopped for dinner. Packed at 8:30pm on a Wed. I was alone so lucky to score a single seat at a communal table. Had to get the popular milk braised pork shoulder (5/5) and the broccoli (5/5). Just terrific. Pork shoulder was very tender and just melts in your mouth. Doesn't look like a big portion, but trust me, its enough. I don't usually order side veg since i chomp on salads most days, but you must get this. I would put both dishes against the best meat/veg dishes in NYC. Â I can't wait to come back since I really wanted more, but thankfully the waitress stopped me.
