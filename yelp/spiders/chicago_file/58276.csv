Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here for an early dinner before it got crowded. The restaurant is comfortable, food was good, service was excellent but expect a pricey bill. We ordered the excellent tasting Brussels Sprout Salad. I would love this recipe. The Chicken Empanada was ok, I wasn't crazy about the crust. The Goat Cheese baked in tomato sauce with garlic bread was excellent and a nice portion. The Salmon with root veggies was tasty but a small portion size for price. The Rioja-Braised Short Rib was our least favorite as the meat was tough and tasted more like pot roast then short rib. The Sangria was very good. Â I would return to try other dishes.
