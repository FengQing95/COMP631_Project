Little Goat Diner////I went to Little Goat diner over the weekend with my spouse, brother, sister-in-law and niece. We had reservations and seated immediately. We ordered all sorts of breakfast dishes (cant remember the names) and loved everything. The food is unique, beautiful, fresh and delicious. We plan to return again to try more options.
