Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I thought the service was great. Everyone was super friendly and helpful. They were definitely willing to go the extra mile. One of the steaks that was ordered wasn't cooked as requested, so they sent out a new one, and even took it off the bill entirely! Grade A service that went above and beyond expectations.
