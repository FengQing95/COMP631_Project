Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////There were several birthdays and a man would come out with an silver ice bucket and bang on it loudly while singing happy birthday.  It was a bit much for my taste but the other patrons seemed to enjoy. Our waitress brought us a dessert for our anniversary which turned the bad taste in my mouth into a good one.  I contemplated writing this review as I've been here a few other locations and never had a bad experience. The waitress was absolutely pleasant and if it wasn't for her I probably would of rated this night 1 star.  I'm not sure I would be able to convince my husband to come back unfortunately.
