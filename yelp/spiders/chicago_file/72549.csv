Little Goat Diner////This place is different than Hannah's Bretzels in terms of the type of sandwiches they are. So I cannot compare the two together. But if I must, I will sadly though, deem Hannah's Bretzels as the winner. Yea, Little Goat gives you more food and costs less, but in terms of taste, I still give the nod to Hannah.
