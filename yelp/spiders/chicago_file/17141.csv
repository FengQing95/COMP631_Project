Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////You come to Chicago and you don't try to pizza?  You must be nuts.  I cannot compare and contrast the pizza here to the NY style (I'm from east coast) unlike some other uneducated people that really compare the styles of pizza.  Its trying to compare between apples and peaches.  Both are fruits and sweet in taste yet they are different.  People, these are just two different styles of pizza where you cannot and shouldn't compare them.
