Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The 3 of us started with a family size spinach salad with chicken. The salad was good, strawberries were ripe but there was not enough of them. Also not enough chicken in my opinion. Thankfully the same was the case with the dressing, but I hate salads that are swimming in dressing. The salad would have served 4-5, so we probably should have done the regular size.
