Art Institute of Chicago////Only other note I have is that the Monet has a virtual line to enter. I was trying to save it until the end and didn't get to see it as it was a 60-90 minute wait. Would have been nice to have signs warning one of this (I don't recall any, but I also could have missed them), but it is something to be prepared for!!
