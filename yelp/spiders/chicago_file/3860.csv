The Purple Pig////WORTHY OF 5 STARS. Some of the finest cuisine I've had in Chicago. The pork shoulder was so soft . The octopus is way good. Grilled broccoli was an explosion of flavor in my mouth. As I'm typing, my mouth is salivating rn. No wait at all for me when I went. Nice servers. Fantastic. Some of the best food I've ever had in my life. Straight up.
