Little Goat Diner////The food is excellent--5 star! The service unfortunately was disappointing. We sat at the counter and it took 20 minutes for our waitress to bring us coffee and take our food orders. She only came back once to refill after they'd been empty for a good 15 minutes. Overall it took over an hour for breakfast on a weekday morning which we mostly attribute to our waitress. Definitely would go back for the food though!
