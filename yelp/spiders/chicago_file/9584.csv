Art Institute of Chicago////The museum is I believe the worlds leading museum when it comes to organizing art shows and exhibitions- parts of the whole exhibitions are even taken to other museums around the world- I remember only part of Monet came to HI after having seen it in Chicago it was not disappointing but understandable.  It really is expensive to fly and ship so many works of art for a show and it is extremely difficult to get approval for so many pieces of work from the owners (many pieces are not owned by museums at all but private collectors that only have a few pieces or 1).
