Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////There are many different styles of pizza but I came here for the Chicago deep dish experience and Lou Malnati's did not disappoint. The wait staff was nice and friendly and explained that all deep dish pizzas would take around 30-40 minutes to arrive. Trust me, the wait is WORTH IT! Grab yourself an appetizer and a beer while you wait. I recommend the Bruschetta.
