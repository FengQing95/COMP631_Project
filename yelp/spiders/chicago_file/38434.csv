Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I had the 16oz Chicago cut ribeye with the bone marrow which was unreal! It was soo flavourful and cooked perfectly. My girlfriend had the 6oz petite fillet which was the perfect size for her! Her steak was the softest fillet ever and we both agreed that these steaks were the best we've ever had!
