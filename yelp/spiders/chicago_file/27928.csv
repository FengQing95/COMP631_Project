Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Worth the wait!  It was crowded with a line to get in but worth the wait. Everything I was hoping for and more when I wanted to try authentic Chicago deep dish. I was totally satisfied with every bite of everything we tried and we tried a lot of things in the menu!  Go for the traditional and then go from there.
