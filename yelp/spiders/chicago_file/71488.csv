Little Goat Diner////But back to Little Goat-- while the restaurant is a little bit loud, the food and drinks are amazing. I mean really good. It's so nice to see Chef Stephanie Izard take on comfort foods and put her twist on them. Her tuna melt is extraordinary. The fries were and are addictive. The cinnamon rolls are ooey goodness. Even the choices that weren't made in the restaurant are great. The restaurant as a solid craft beer selection, but I personally am in love with the vanilla cream soda. It's one of the best cream sodas I've ever had.
