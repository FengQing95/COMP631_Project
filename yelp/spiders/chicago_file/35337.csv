Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I came here for my anniversary and we had some of the most amazing food we've ever experienced. We had the shrimp cocktail, Chicago ribeye, Halibut (the fish special for the night), creamed spinach, mac n cheese, and the chocolate cream pie. Our dinner was amazing, the service was incredible, the portion sizes were perfect, and this was easily one of our top restaurants ever experienced.
