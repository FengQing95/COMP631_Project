Art Institute of Chicago////I simply adore this museum. The wide selection of art is sure to satisfy everyone in your group. Â For the art novice such as myself, there are enough well known paintings and sculptures to keep things interesting. I love seeing new (to me) artwork, but every time I stumble across a familiar one, it's like adding fuel to my fire.
