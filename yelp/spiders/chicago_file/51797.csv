Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been here several times and feel that I am qualified to write this review. The sangrias are great and strong so be careful not to keep knocking them back. Definitely order the patatas bravas as they are the most all-around-good menu item, enjoyed by everyone at the table. Everything else varies. I've had some good and not so good; although most of it seemed to be a difference in taste buds.
