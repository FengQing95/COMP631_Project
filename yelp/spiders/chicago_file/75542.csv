Little Goat Diner////We were searching for a new breakfast spot and had not checked out Little Goat yet.  What a pair!  The atmosphere is upscale retro diner.  We split a smattering of entrées because so many sounded so good.  We went with This Little Piggy went to China - which had a great combination of savory and sweet flavors; the OKONOMIYAKI (which street did this food come from??) that was out of this world; the Bulls Eye French Toast (brioche French Toast meets egg in the hole delicious); the Bi Bim Bop (my vegetarian loved minus the bacon); the sourdough pancakes (teen boy devoured but tasted like ordinary pancakes to me) and a side of the park belly home fries (awesome).  What a great combination.  Everyone said - we have our new breakfast place!
