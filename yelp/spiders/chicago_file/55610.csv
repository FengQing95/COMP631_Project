Smoque BBQ////I only had two small issues with this place. First, the ordering/seating was a little disorganized, especially since it was pretty busy. It ended up working out fine, and we got our food quickly, but it was just a little disorganized and confusing. Second, we got a "taster portion" of the ST. Louis ribs. They weren't the best I've ever had (*cough* they were no Twin Anchors *cough*.) They were a little tough--definitely not "fall off the bone" tender that I like.
