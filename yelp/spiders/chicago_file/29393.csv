Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Was meeting up with a friend who was in the Midwest for a conference. She had Lou Malnati's on her to-do list, so I happily went a long. It was a Saturday night when we went for a party of 3. It was pretty chilly evening in June so Everyone was waiting inside. Really-- it felt like Everyone in the city was waiting inside. I can't even remember how long we waited, it was close to an hour probably. But we were so cold and hungry and the food smelled so good.
