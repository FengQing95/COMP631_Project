Little Goat Diner////This is now a must when in Chicago. Went for brunch with some friends.  Started with the cinnamon roll, delicious, and we then moved onto savory- the parathas burrito (with bacon!), a Reuben (with kimichi, harvarti and pretzel rye), the omelet daily special and the Goat'o-Goat'o salad.  We all gobbled the food down with no complaints while enjoying coffee and the cocktail of the day - Scotch in the Morning. Happily "rolling" out of our booth at the end of the meal.
