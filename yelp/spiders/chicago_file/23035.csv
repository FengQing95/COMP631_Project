Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As for the pizza, it was delicious. No argument about it. We ordered The Malnati Chicago Classic and added some onions and hot giardinera to it. Everything complimented itself in this pie, and the crust had a solid doughy bite. I would have wanted just a little more sauce though.
