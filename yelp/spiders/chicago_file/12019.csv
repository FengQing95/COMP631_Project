Art Institute of Chicago////My favorite event was the tour of Greek and Roman art which I studied a lot in college, so to see the sculptures right in front of me was breathtaking! Â I went through the exhibit at least 8 times - I told my friends & coworkers - I'll meet you at the restaurant later, still want to go thru again.
