The Purple Pig////We ordered 3 dishes to share between two people and it was more than enough (Because we wanted to save room for dessert). We ordered the calamari (It's a cold dish by the way), the pig ears and the chicken kebabs. Everything was absolutely delicious. The chicken kebabs were very tender and perfectly seasoned. The pig ears dish is a must get. I don't really like kale and now crave the kale from that dish. The staff was very kind and very prompt. I definitely want to come back and try everything else on the menu!
