Smoque BBQ////I had pretty high expectations coming here, and I wasn't disappointed.  The line was rather long when we arrived (I came with a group of five at 7pm on a Saturday), but it moved quickly--I think we waited about 30 minutes to place our order, and then the food came out another 15 minutes after that.  I was slightly worried that my group wouldn't get to sit together, but the staff was really efficient at seating everyone at the long, family-style tables.
