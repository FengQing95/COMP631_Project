Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The wine was brought to our table already open, which was highly unusual. The waiter later explained, after we brought it up, that the bartenders inside always do this. Not a great policy for $20+ bottle of wine, in my opinion. On that note, there wasn't really much ambiance to speak of at Lou Malnati's; they seem to be primarily focused on their pizzas, which actually is not a bad thing.
