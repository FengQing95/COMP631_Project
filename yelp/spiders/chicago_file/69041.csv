Little Goat Diner////I had eaten at Stephanie Izard's first restaurant, The Girl & the Goat, three times and have been impressed each time. I finally had an opportunity to try its offspring, Little Goat Diner. I made 7pm reservations through OpenTable but had to wait until 7:20 to be seated due to how busy it was on a Tuesday evening. I have absolutely no issue with that, not at all, especially since sincere effort was made to confirm they had my cell phone number to contact me when a table became available.
