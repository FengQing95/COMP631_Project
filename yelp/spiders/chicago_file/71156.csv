Little Goat Diner////I've been here a couple of times and definitely am a fan. There's always a wait or I would go more often.  Food is GREAT!  Service is very good.  I had the chicken and waffles and loved it.  Fun diner for brunch on the weekends.  Great to bring guests from out of town for brunch!
