Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I always love Cafe Ba Ba Ree Ba.  It's the best place to go with a big group - the Red and White Sangria are awesome, and the sugar rimmed mojitos are really great as well.  I love the baked goat cheese and if they ever have scallops- get them!  The spicy potatoes are also much but I must say I never feel like I Have to go the paella.  I like to split like 4 or 5 dishes between a few people instead. This place is great for a date- or any night!
