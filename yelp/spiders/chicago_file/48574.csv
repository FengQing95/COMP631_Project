Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Amazing food, great service and really cool atmosphere. The goat cheese & garlic bread, grilled hanger steak, pork paella (2 servings for 4 people was plenty), and the calamari were all AMAZING. Oh and they make a really tasty gin & tonic (THE Gin & Tonic) that has mint & cucumber in it.
