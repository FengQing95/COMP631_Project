Art Institute of Chicago////I loved LOVED so many of the permanent works there. The modern American art section was mind-blowing. I will have to concede my bias, it was the best I have ever seen. And that's even without being able to see American Gothic (it is currently on tour). I loved seeing the Jackson Pollocks, the Georgia O'Keefes and the Picassos.
