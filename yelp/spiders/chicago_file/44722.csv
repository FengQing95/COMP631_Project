Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ordered several different items from the tapas menu and it all was wonderful and made us want more. We also ordered the Paella with artichoke's and i was surprised they were actually fresh not from a can like most other restaurants. The Paella was so splendid I can't wait to go back for more!
