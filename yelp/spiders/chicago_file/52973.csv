Smoque BBQ////Really solid BBQ place. Heard lots of great things about it and finally gave it a shot. We ordered a variety of meat items: baby back, st. louis, brisket, pulled pork. And then a sample of sides. The restaurant lives up to its name. Nice smokey flavor with good rub taste. And a little cheaper than places like Fat Willy's and not so pretentious as some other places like those in the west loop or Wicker Park.
