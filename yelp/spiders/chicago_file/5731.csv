The Purple Pig////Food-wise, everything we ordered was delicious, with my favorite being the roasted bone marrow. However, prices were pretty steep. $14 for gnocci and $13 for potatoes was not worth it in my opinion, for such a small serving size and for something you can do easily make yourself. They recommend 2-3 dishes per person. I'd say get 3-5 because I was still hungry after 2. The bone marrow was worth it though in my opinion - so rich and melts in your mouth!
