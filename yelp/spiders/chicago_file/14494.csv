Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Read some other reviews who said the crust was too thick or they went there for a salad.  Folks it's Chicago and its a pizza joint...you want thin crust got to NY and if you want a salad go somewhere else.  Went there after the dinner rush...I'm a big fan of thin crust so was a little hesitant.  Great pizza, great service, good beers.  Someone even ordered a salad.  All really good.  For Chicago pizza crust was not overly thick....just right.  Get the usual, we also had a vegetarian as well very nice.  Would go back for sure.
