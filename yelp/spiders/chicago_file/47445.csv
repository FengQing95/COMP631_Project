Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Shrug. Sat at bar with friend, ordered scallops (pretty decent), shrimp (kinda small/medium-ish/sad) and spicy potatoes (best of the three...as in they are potatoes).  Food in general was acceptable; nothing that blew my socks off.  Same can be said about service but with less enthusiasm.
