Smoque BBQ////Just thinking about Smoque makes my mouth water and my hands shake. I started going there after seeing it on Food Networks "Diners, Drive-Inns, and Dives. Being that it is located less than 1 mile from my home also didn't hurt. Hands down their sliced brisket sandwich is the best BBQ item I have ever tasted in my life. Always hot, always fresh, always kick ass! I've also tried the Pulled Pork sandwich which was so tender it melted in my mouth. The BBQ beans are great as well as they add pieces of the brisket in there for a very smoky like texture. The Macoroni and Cheese is yummy with a crusted layer of parmesan on the top. Cole slaw is good and the ribs are to die for. But if you are going here for 1 thing it would be the sliced brisket (chopped brisket is OK but the flavor disappears for some reason). The owner Barry is always there and always courteous and genuine. Warning though, if you can go on a weekday after 2PM to avoid the killer lines. Also they tend to run out of food because they are so busy on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Chicago BBQ at its best. And its closed on Mondays.
