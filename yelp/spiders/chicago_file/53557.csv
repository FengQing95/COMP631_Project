Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place has AMAZING BRUNCH. The space is nice and large, not too loud, and the wait staff was very helpful in walking through the menu and giving suggestions without being pushy. The food is absolutely incredible. You cannot go wrong ordering anything!! I will definitely be going back and bringing any friends visiting Chicago!
