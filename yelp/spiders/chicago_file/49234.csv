Smoque BBQ////I had BBQs from a lot of different BBQ joints, and I must say, this place is on my number 1 list for BBQ in Chicago! The workers there are really nice and the service is fast. I ordered the ribs with two sides. The ribs looked too dry to me, but when I took a bite of it, it was actually tender and delicious! For the sides, I had the Mac and cheese and the brisket chili. Both sides weren't that amazingly great to me, but they're pretty good. I had the sample of the peach cobbler from my bf's plate and that was amazingly good! I'm not a big fan of sweets and I usually complain if a dessert is too sweet for me, but as for the peach cobbler, it had the right amount of sweetness to it, just the way i like it! I also had a bite of the brisket from my brother's gf's plate and I actually like the brisket better than the ribs. But overall, I'm satisfied with my meal and I'm pleased with the fast and great service they provided us.
