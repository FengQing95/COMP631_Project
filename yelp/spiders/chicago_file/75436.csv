Little Goat Diner////This is my main problem with the diner: the food. The flavor combinations are an eager attempt to combine unique flavors and ideas but fall short most of the time. On my most recent visit I got the Bull's Eye French Toast. I could not taste the BBQ elements in the syrup they report, the chicken tasted like the Chinese food found in mall cafeterias, and I found an eggshell in my eggs.
