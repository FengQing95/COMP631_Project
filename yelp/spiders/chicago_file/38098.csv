Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Only came here for drinks but it was a lovely experience. The atmosphere was dark and swanky and intimate with candlelit tables and large chandeliers. There was a nostalgic feel to everything with the music and vintage posters on the wall. The place was pretty much full with most tables occupied and a crowded bar. We ended up sitting at the couches up front with our drinks. It was clearly a place to come for a special occasion or nice night of wining and dining. We were promptly served our drinks, which were well crafted. Next time, I'll have to return to give some of those oysters a go!
