Art Institute of Chicago////There are a lot of things to love about this museum. The Thorne miniature room is what I find most fascinating during my visit. I was impressed by the high level of detail and precision in each artworks. You can see American, Asian, and European household interiors ranging from the 13th to 19th century. The gallery of impressionism is also very impressive.
