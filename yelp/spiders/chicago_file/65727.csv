Smoque BBQ////My group of 4 decided to share a bunch of stuff: 1.25 lb of sliced brisket, full slab of baby back ribs, large BBQ beans, large mac & cheese, large fresh cut fries, and 3 cornbreads. Â We chose sliced brisket over chopped for its higher fat content, definitely worth the extra calories. Included with the order were 3 types of sauce (Memphis style, Spicy Memphis style, Carolina style). The Spicy Memphis was my favorite -- I dipped everything in it! While the four of us were able to finish everything, we were absolutely STUFFED. We probably should have gotten one less side and stuck with 1 lb of brisket.
