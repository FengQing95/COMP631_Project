Smoque BBQ////But, the show stopper for me, was without a doubt the baby back ribs! They are what I've been looking for my whole BBQ life. The blackened crust was devine, the meat was not quite fall off the bone, it was juicy, smoky, flavorful, a lil spicy- everything ribs should be, and what you expect them to taste like when you find yourself watching a BBQ cook-off on the Food Network for one too many hours on a sad Thursday night.
