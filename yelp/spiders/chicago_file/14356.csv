Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The cheese was bland, there was barely any sauce (just small tomato chunks), and the crust was too buttery and crispy. Hardly edible. I was starving so I ate it and was full, but I wouldn't go back. I'll stick with another Chicago pizza instead (Giordano's). Some people swear by Lou Malnati's but it just isn't what I was looking for in my pizza.
