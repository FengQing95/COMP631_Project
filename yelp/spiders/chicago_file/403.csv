Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Saw this place online before hearing about it from a local tour guide.  So glad we decided to try them this morning.  Hubby had a Denver skillet, very tasty, and only complaint was that the bell peppers could have been cut smaller.  I had the Florentine Benedict, which I have never had with bacon, but the combination was very yummy.  Both dishes were way more food than we could finish, so a good deal for the price.  And Kimberly L. was an excellent server, very attentive despite the crowd.
