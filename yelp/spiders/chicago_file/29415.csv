Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered the Medium Malnati Salad and the Personal Pan Cheese Buttercrust Pizza. The salad was excellent. The Pizza was good, very thick and cheesy. I just have a personal preference for Pizza styles, but I'm so glad I've had a taste of the best Deep Dish pizza Chicago has to offer.
