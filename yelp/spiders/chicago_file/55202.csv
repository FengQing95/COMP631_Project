Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Every single thing on the menu is excellent. Some tapas are bigger than other but you can always ask the server. For example, the sandwiches are much bigger than the tapas and Benedicts. The Pinxtos (one or two bites) are so clever, who doesn't face the classic dilemma of sweet or savory for brunch!? Well here, you can have it all! Including multiple sweet and savory. The paella definitely serves more than 2-3 as it claims. We had a party of 9 and didn't finish it (granted we all got one other thing plus some Pinxtos). We loved the seasonal sangria, Pomegranate and we downed it quick. Next we go the classic red sangria, and after ordering, we kind of regretted getting it for brunch, only because I think a lighter wine/sangria suits brunch better, but thats just all up to personal taste.
