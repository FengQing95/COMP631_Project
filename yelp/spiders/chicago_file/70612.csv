Little Goat Diner////I was so impressed by my first Little Goat experience! My boyfriend and I went on a double date there on Friday night with two of our friends. Despite what we had heard about potential wait times, we were seated almost immediately when we arrived at 8:30pm. Our waitress, Jillian was extremely sweet and attentive. AND the best part was the delicious food. I'm telling you, I'm a nacho expert and I've never had nachos better than these! Since they serve breakfast,lunch and dinner all day long, my boyfriend followed our appetizers with some crunchy chocolate chip pancakes and I ended my meal with the choco taco sundae. Superb experience - can't wait to return! Also makes me very excited to try their sister restaurant Girl and the Goat and their soon-to-open restaurant Duck Duck Goat. Definitely recommend spending your evening at Little Goat, it's an unforgettable experience!
