Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here with my sister, was seated very promptly with our OpenTable reservation. The server was very knowledgeable about the menu items, and we wish we could have ordered everything on the menu! Tapa style, we ordered dish after dish and the filet was awesome! Sangriaaaa all day every dayyy :-)
