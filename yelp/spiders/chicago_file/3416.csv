The Purple Pig////Roasted Bone Marrow with herb salad & sicilian sea salt: No joke, probably the biggest bone marrow dish I have been served. It was humongous! I am not complaining but damn I was surprised. The marrow was really good. if you haven't had bone marrow in the past, give it a try. The best way to describe this dish is meat butter. The herb salad was nice and light which went nice with the rich and fatty marrow. Add some sea salt for additional flavor and texture. The toasted bread was nice as well.
