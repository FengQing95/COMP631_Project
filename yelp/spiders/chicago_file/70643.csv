Little Goat Diner////A friend brought me here before heading to the airport.   Very fun place... a great diverse menu with really interesting tastes and combinations.   I had the PARATHAS BURRITO for breakfast, which is indian flatbread, sunny side eggs, avocado-bean salad, chili pepper sauce, sheep's milk cheddar... wow, amazing flavors.   I have a pic of the burrito, I'll try to upload.
