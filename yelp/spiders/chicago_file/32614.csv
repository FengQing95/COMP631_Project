Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////There is a reason they say that this restaurant is the 'sexiest room' in Chicago- its pretty romantic and sexy! Very dimly lit with beautiful decor. I felt like I had stepped back in time to the 1920s or something. There is a very classy feel to this place and it was worth every penny. As an appetizer, we ordered the oysters which were so good! Our waiter was able to tell us where they were from, etc. For dinner, I had the petite duchess cut filet mignon with a side of truffle mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. It was all amazing and so delicious! The entrees are pricy but worth it! The waiter was very knowledgable about the differences between the cuts of steak and how they are prepared. Each steak comes with a side of bernaise sauce but you don't even need it- the steak is perfection. This is one of the best restaurants in Chicago and there is good reason for it. Make a point to eat here if you can!
