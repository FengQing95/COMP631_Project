Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So for the deep dish pizza I was expecting bounds of flavor and melted cheese oozing as you take a bite into it. Instead -  it did have good flavor but the cheese seemed to had already congealed quickly since when we took a bite, it was like taking  a bite out of a solid piece of cheese. I also like sauce .. and this wasn't very saucy. Now I realize it's so thick due to the thickness of the dough/bread and the slab of cheese.
