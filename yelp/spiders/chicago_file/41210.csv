Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Had an area reserved for my husband's 30th birthday party which was so fun and the food was fantastic! I worked with Alison who is the party coordinator and she was very helpful and accommodating. We even had guests that showed up last minute and there was no hesitation with adding another spot for them. With this reservation I had chosen a prefixed menu and the best part was that if we wanted more of something it was okay to ask the waiters. We had a set of waiters just dedicated to us and they were very prompt and alert. Definitely will be returning!!! Cold curry chicken, calamari, vegetarian paella, and their marcona almond tart were AMAZING!!!
