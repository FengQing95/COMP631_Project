Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was looking for the best deep dish and came upon this place. The pizza was very good. Be prepared for a wait. I went on a Saturday evening and expected a wait. There was a lot of confusion on where you went for take out and where to order to sit. You have to order your pizza first even if you are dining in to allow time for it to cook once your table was ready.
