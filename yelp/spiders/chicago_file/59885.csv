Smoque BBQ////I chit chat with the owner whenever I'm on the phone or in line and he says the same thing, that he loves that it's loved by Chicagoians, but hates that it's getting so busy.  Apparently, the idea was for it to be a neighborhood spot, only it's so good EVERYONE goes there.  So, the neighbors have been complaining, and it's not been very friendly.
