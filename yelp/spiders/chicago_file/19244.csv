Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I am no Deep Dish expert but my husband and I were happy with the Lou Classic we got. It was no easy task however. We were told we have to wait 1.5 hr+ for a table for 2. We told them we would just do takeout since our hotel has a kitchen. They said 35 mins wait so that was nothing compared to 1.5 hr wait. Somehow though, the crowd quickly subdued and I guess they were mostly scared away! So we were lucky to be seated with our takeout pizza.
