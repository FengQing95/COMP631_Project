Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The service is great here, especially since they are always jammed packed! The ambiance is great for bigger groups or double dates. I wouldn't call it romantic, but there are 5 different rooms, so depending on where you sit the noise level can be pretty loud or a little quieter. Can't wait to come back here soon!
