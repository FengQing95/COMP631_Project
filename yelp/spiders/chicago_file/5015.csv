The Purple Pig////We ordered another round of drinks and decided to start with a combination of meats and cheeses. For meat we went with Blood Mortadella, Lingua and the Salumi. For cheese we went with the Grayson, a french triple creme and another that escapes me. We paired this with the marcona almonds in honey. Everything was simply superb.
