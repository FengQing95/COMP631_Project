Smoque BBQ////They do not get 5 stars because it is basically a fast food joint. You come in, get in line to order, they find you a table, then you have to go get your food when they yell your number. AND they have screaming kids, just like any other fast food place. (OK... so we could have gone later in the evening to avoid the screaming kids.)
