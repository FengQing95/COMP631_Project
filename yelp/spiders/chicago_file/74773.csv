Little Goat Diner////I started with the homemade Bloody Mary mix, different, but amazing. Luckily my daughter and I got a spot at the bar and didn't have to wait 20 mins. Friday afternoon. We shared 2 meals and I absolutely loved the corned beef hash. More like grilled corned beef over shoe stringed hash potatoes with eggs over easy. Delicious!! Â  Beef brisket sandwich was also fabulous. Ok, I liked it. Even though at first I didn't think I'd like the Asian influences in my brunch. The bakery and coffee bar is also good
