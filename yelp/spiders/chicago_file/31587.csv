Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We got the XL Malnati Chicago Classic, which was more than enough to feed us 4 (2 gigantic slices each). The classic sausage, cheese and tomato combination was delicious. The hidden layer of sausage was such a pleasant surprise! There wasn't much of a cheese pull, albeit the pizza has already cooled a bit after I brought it back to our hotel room. The most disappointing part was the crust. It was indeed deep dish, however the dough wasn't cooked all the way through. I could distinctly see the cooked vs uncooked layers in the crust.
