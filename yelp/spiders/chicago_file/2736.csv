The Purple Pig////I can see why this place is so popular and has received so much praise! Honestly you couldn't really go wrong with any of the selection - I especially loved the roasted beets with pistachio butter and whipped goat cheese, and the milk braised pork shoulders are so tender that the knife just melts through the meat. Their meatballs, although highly recommended by the waiter and were indeed very fresh and juicy, were not that exceptional so I would suggest saving your stomach for something else. For dessert, we could've probably ordered something better because the poached pear with genoa cake that we got was pretty mediocre. But in general everything really delivered, in terms of taste, quality and portions. The dishes are in small plates and are meant to be shared.
