Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This pizza was a wonderful ending to our day! We had the Chicago special which was peppers, onions, sausage and mushrooms. The tomato sauce was spot on and homemade. It truly made the pizza spectacular. We also got a salad which is a great pairing with a deep dish pizza. The pizza was delicious and the small was big enough for two people. Definitely will be back to have this pizza again.
