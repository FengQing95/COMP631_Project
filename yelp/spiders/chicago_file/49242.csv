Smoque BBQ////This place is about 3/4 of a mile away from my condo and I am so glad it is.  I am a repeat customer as the food here is fantastic.  Everything I've had has always been excellent, but the Pulled Pork sandwich is my favorite.  A single sandwich is typically more than enough food for 1 meal, and I sometimes make 2 out of it (usually with a side order).  The peach cobbler is a great desert, but i do wish that there was a little more to the corn bread.
