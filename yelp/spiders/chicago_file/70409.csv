Little Goat Diner////Next we had the pork belly pancake, which is awesome, except for the pork belly part.  The fluffy scallion pancake is full of flavor and holds up well to the very dressed sweet-tangy slaw on top of it.  The pork belly was a big slab of salty soft meat, but the flavors in it were lacking.  Just salty and soft.
