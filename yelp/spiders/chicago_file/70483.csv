Little Goat Diner////But diners beware, you need street smarts to even get a chance to enjoy the Little Goat's wonderful food!  The restaurant is a Millennial favorite at the moment and you can't avoid the massive lines unless you are strategic and show up with the Boomers and Babies--namely before 9:00 am!
