Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I don't love it, but I don't hate it. It's just okay. I come here when my friends want to go, but I go to Iberico if I'm planning. The service is usually snooty and the food isn't really worth the price, in my opinion. I think it's ironic that the "crispy calamari" are not really crispy at all. The rest of the food I've had, though, has been decent. One of my friends keeps trying to tell me that the patatas bravas make up for everything else that the restaurant is lacking, so they are on my list to try. Maybe I'll change my mind?
