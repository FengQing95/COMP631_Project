Art Institute of Chicago////Once inside, we tried our best to check off all the Ferris Bueller stops, but this place is huge!  And the map is not so user friendly.  What we did get to was the Picasso stuff, Monet, Sunday afternoon, and Nighthawks (aka Boulevard of Broken Dreams for all you who owned the cheap print imitation with those 50 icons ;-)  My husband also made sure we saw American Gothic, his Iowa roots I guess!  In addition, we saw an interesting photo exhibit with older black and white photos of people, buildings, landmarks, and very bad fashion circa 1960s and 70s.  They are also running a current exhibit of some Picasso collections.  Thought I'd really like that one, but turns out, not my cup of tea.  What I did enjoy was an exhibit called They Seek A City:  Chicago and the Art of Migration.  This was a collection of paintings by immigrants and/or people of color or paintings depicting their lives in Chicago in the early 20th century.  The bummer for me as a crazy dog lady was i missed the exhibit called Spot the Dog:  Paw Prints.  These were paintings with hidden paw prints.  Missed it because not all of these exhibits are listed on the paper copies of info you receive at the entrance.  My recommendation is to go to the web site and find out what exhibits are available and map out what you want to see before you get there.  Also if you are like me, stay away from the contemporary collections.  I can't help but get annoyed when someone paints an entire canvas solid blue and calls it art (because the color is expressing itself) or strings a bunch of lights together and hangs it from the ceiling (ooh, look!  So luminous and bright, it just speaks watts.).
