Smoque BBQ////I assume that I was eating like Homer Simpson because I caught some looks of horror as I gulped down sweet tea, made smacking noises as I ate my sandwich and stuffed fries in my mouth.  I didn't care.  There were free refills to take advantage of and food in front of me to eat.  The looks are deceiving re the portion size.  The folks at Smoque do not skimp on portion size.  I'm a big eater and I was barely able to clean my plate.  I was happy that I didn't order the cobbler, as I would not have been able to eat it.
