Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered the Lou deep dish for my family of four. The butter crust was so tasty and, and the sauce and tomatoes were fresh! I wasn't a huge fan of all the cheese, thus the four stars, but if you love lots of cheese, this is perfect for you. It is a bit of a wait to get the pizza because it takes a while to cook, but I would say it's worth it! Definitely mark out some time from your day to eat here.
