Smoque BBQ////Very very solid bbq. Runs like a well oiled machine in here and it is always busy so you may feel a little rushed. The only complain could be that there is not a whole lot of selection, just brisket and pulled pork. if you are looking for some exotic bbq you won't find it here. But they do a superb job at what they smoque. Highly recommended. Places like this make Chicago a decent city.
