Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was expecting this to be a disappointing Friday night experience, but I heard that this is one of the better popular deep dish spots in town.  While waiting for our table to be ready (a one hour wait), we decided it would be best to order the pizza 30 minutes into the wait (that way it would be ready relatively close to when we were seated).  Ordered the vegetarian deep dish (forget the name because I was definitely tipsy at the bar by that time).
