Art Institute of Chicago////I have been here a number of times.  Seen a few different shows.  This museum does have a large and varied collection that's on permanent display, or at least displayed often and for long periods of time.  There is an African Art section, with lots of sculpture; there is an Impressionist area, followed up with a post-Impressionist area.   There is an "American Indian" area, showcasing some of the remaining works from this group.  Georgia O'Keefe donated the Alfred Stieglitz collection here, so the photography collection has grown from there.  So you can see, there really is a little of everything, and sure to be something you may enjoy and perhaps learn a thing or two from.
