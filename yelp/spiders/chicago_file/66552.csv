Little Goat Diner////Everything I have eaten here has been AMAZING!  I have not been disappointed with anything.  It's a family friendly place that has great food.  The thing I like is the twist on food.  I enjoy eating at places where I order something I cannot make at home.  This is definitely the place!  I love Little Goat. It is one of our favorite places in the West Loop.
