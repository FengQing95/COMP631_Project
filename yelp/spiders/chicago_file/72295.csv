Little Goat Diner////This place was ok. We came here for dinner and found that they are mainly a breakfast place. We got the patty melt which was nothing special, sadly. My sandwich was the fat club and that was tasty, but the mac & cheese was very plain. The staff was really helpful and the food came quickly. Very much a diner, but these little sandwiches were overpriced and came out with no sides. Much better food elsewhere in Chicago.
