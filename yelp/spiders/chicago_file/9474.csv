Art Institute of Chicago////As a member of the Art Institute, I was fortunate to visit the new Modern Wing today before the "official" grand opening this weekend. Unlike the impression of a mere addition to a world-class museum, this new building designed by famed architect Renzo Piano feels like a unique entity. It is as if Chicago has gained a whole new art museum to enjoy, contained in a stunning new facility that will give the MCA a run for its money. The Modern WIng even has actual rooms to display architecture exhibits, instead of the leftover hallways previously allocated to them. I will look forward to seeing more of the Modern Wing (it definitely has a "new car" smell to it today), as well as to walking across the new pedestrian bridge linking it over Monroe Street to Millennium Park.
