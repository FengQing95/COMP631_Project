Smoque BBQ////So, let me first say, the only thing remotely "healthy" on the menu is the coleslaw.  Thank the good Lord they make it with more vinegar than mayo (yuck -mayo?)  I gotta say, all was good.  Had the briquet (sp?) chilli which was fab, didn't dare touch the mac-n-cheese, the corn bread was perfect since it didn't have a ton of corn kernels in it (I hate it when it's like that!!), all the meat seemed to fall of the bone and into the mouth.
