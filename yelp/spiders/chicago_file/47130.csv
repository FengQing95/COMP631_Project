Smoque BBQ////I hate it when places don't live up to all of their hype.  Luckily, Smoque BBQ hasn't received any praise it didn't deserve.  This place is great!  From the hand pulled pork to the succulent brisket, you just can't go wrong.  I suggest you call ahead on a Friday or Saturday night so you don't have to wait in the massive line.  I am not kidding- The line is huge and well deserved.
