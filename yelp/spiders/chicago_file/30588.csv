Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The rest of the team went H.A.M on the deep dish. The classic, the mushroom and the cheese were all ordered and devoured with pleasure. But, we are getting ahead of ourselves. When it came time to serve said pizzas I couldn't tell if I was being yelled at for ordering my food or being yelled at because there was so much. In a loud voice "okay, I've got two Classic, where are they going," "well hand me plates and I'll hand you the pizza!"
