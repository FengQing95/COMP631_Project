Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have had a great experience each and evertime I have gone to Babareeba.  The food is amazing, the sangria is delicious and makes me feel great, and the atmosphere is lively and fun.  Great place to go as a couple or in a group for any special occasion.  There is a lot to choose from on the menu (typical of tapas places) and usually everyone is happy.  I like to take people who are visiting chicago here, they always love it.  Its a pretty big place so there is a lot of seating, but it is always busy so make a reservation if you can.  Highly recommended
