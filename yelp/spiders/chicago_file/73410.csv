Little Goat Diner////I'm a fan with the bagel and lox breakfast, which I didn't have.  My pancakes were huge and just too sweet.  I wouldn't order them again.  The breakfast menu is very unusual, and not for light eaters, but quite inventive.  The bakery is the best, as was the service....it was fun, I just ordered the wrong dish.
