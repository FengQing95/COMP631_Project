Art Institute of Chicago////The length, breadth, and depth of this museum must approach infinity.  Indeed much like the universe, the Art Institute is also slowly expanding.  I suggest tackling this museum in multiple trips, so as to avoid art fatigue.  I don't know anything about art, and yet, I've spend hours here enjoying ars gratia artis.  I know that before long I will jump once more unto the endless halls.
