Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My roommate and I shared a small Lou's deep dish pizza. So good.  nothing was over done, it was cheesey and delicious.  They give you a perfect amount of toppings.  The service was great and very friendly.  They told us the pizza would take about 30 mins, which it did.  That is not a bad thing at all, in fact that means they actually make the pizza. We did not get drinks, but they had a nice looking bar.  The decour was nice and relaxing.  Great experience.
