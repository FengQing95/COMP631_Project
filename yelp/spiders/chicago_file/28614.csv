Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Take the handoff, and was not prepared for how heavy the thing was. This medium pie weighed some pounds..I couldnt help but laugh that I felt I was about to eat pounds of pizza. Open it up, its bulky, thick, heavy...its a lot. I ate a sliver of it, but honestly it didnt wow me. I really dont know what else to say about it. It was good, but not remarkable. I will say I am thankful they used real mushrooms and not canned--that is always worth noting. Im just going to chalk this up as the beginning and end to my Chicago pizza experience. It was also $30, so it is was coming back to South Carolina with me. For $30, I dont care how eh' it was, it was getting finished!
