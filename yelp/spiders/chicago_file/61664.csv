Smoque BBQ////The first time I went to Smoque, I was terrified. Terrified that they'd run out of beef brisket. You see, I had gone to a different 'Q joint the week before, and they had run out...so justifiably terrified (or just certifiably food crazy). My fears were unfounded as they had beef brisket a plenty.
