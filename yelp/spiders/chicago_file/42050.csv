Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The best tapas. Yes, this is a Lettuce Entertain You place but it does not have a corporate feel to it. Great tapas and passionfruit sangria. This place is huge and great for hosting a group of friends(birthday parties, showers) because of the variety of food and the prices are great. Â Always packed. Packed. So get there early or better yet, make reservations. I have never waited for more than 5 minutes for a table. Service is usually good but a bit hurried.
