Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been here several times, and only once was I disappointed with some of the tapas plates.  This past Friday was fairly eventful, though, when a candle exploded on us.  Not kidding.  We were sitting at the bar eating where they had a candle burning in a glass holder on top of the sangria tap, and then POP! glass everywhere.  I thought I was in the Wild West being shot at!  Not that smart to keep hot glass on top of cold metal, but we were fine and the manager took our pitcher and one of the tapas dishes off.  It was very nice of him.
