Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The service was very friendly and efficient. A couple of my friends were really cold when we sat down and asked the server if the air could be turned down, which I thought was unlikely to happen, because it seems like big restaurants never accomodate requests like that, but a few minutes later a manager came over and explained that they had turned up the AC to offset the heat from the oven, but that they had turned it off for us. I was really impressed.
