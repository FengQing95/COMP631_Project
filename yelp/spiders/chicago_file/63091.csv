Smoque BBQ////Places like this scream for a cold beer, but alas none available. This is a demerit. Signs posted outside on the patio (where we ate) stated no liquor allowed, which surprised me as I thought I read the place was BYOB. Still--free soda/tea refills. I'd definitely come back for the good food.
