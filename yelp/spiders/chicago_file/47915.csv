Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Such a fun, different place to go get dinner especially when you have people visiting you from out of town. The food is always delicious and you get to try new things every time because of the large menu and wide variety. Brunch is also great and the diy Bloody Mary bar (though a little expensive) makes for awesome bloodies overflowing with shrimp and bacon.
