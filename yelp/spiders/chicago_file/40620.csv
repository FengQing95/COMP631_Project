Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Made a last minute reservation and was able to get the 3:30 slot. Was a bit early so I was skeptical of grabbing a dinner meal at that time, however, the second you walk into the restaurant, the dim lighting transforms the ambience and you feel like it's the late evening. With the lighting, this place feels very intimate and special.
