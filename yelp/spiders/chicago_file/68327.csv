Little Goat Diner////What an interesting and expansive menu!  It was really tough to choose, but I ordered the Duck Bahn Mi.  The meat and vegetables were excellent, the flavors really meshed. My only issue was with the baguette.  It was a bit tough and crusty for a Bahn Mi roll.  We also had a side of Mac & Cheese, which was good but not great, the cheese was a bit too runny. Given it was opening night, I am inclined to believe that these kinks will be ironed out.  Also, I should note that I really enjoyed the ginger ale, which had a serious kick to it. There are probably a dozen things on the menu that I am excited to try, so I will definitely be back!
