Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Per the instructions from the menu, we ordered the special chocolate chip cookie pizza as we took our 2nd slices of our dinner pizza since it is supposed to take 10 minutes to prepare/bake. 10 minutes later - and after another employee (not our waiter) boxed up our remaining dinner pizza leaving us with only our glasses of water on the table with us, the waiter stopped by and asked if we wanted the check and then the realization hit him as his face showed a semblance of a light bulb going off and he said "I'll put in the order for the chocolate chip pizza now". Another 10 minutes passed and he stopped by our table and asked how we were doing and if we needed anything else. Yet another 10 minutes passed (NO, I am NOT kidding) and he said "I'm going to check on your cookie pizza now". 40 minutes after ordering our cookie pizza it was brought to our table with an apology and blame passed to the kitchen with "I don't know why they took so long to make this for you". No offer to comp the cookie nor provide any other good service offer that I would expect from any caliber of restaurant - much less one with 5,632 YELP reviews resulting in a 4 star rating (as of this date).
