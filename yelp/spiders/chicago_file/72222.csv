Little Goat Diner////Yaaaas! This is my favorite place, like honestly! Amanda was our waitress, and was so helpful and very kind. The menu has a lot of variety, so Amanda let us know what her favorites were. The French Toast is amazing, and so are the Nachos! Definitely coming back again. Awesome Food, Awesome People!
