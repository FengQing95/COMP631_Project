Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tapas are meant to be shared in a group with good conversation so it was off putting when we were reminded several times that we had 90 minutes once we were seated on a weeknight with empty tables around us.  The service was otherwise fine.  The best dishes of the evening were goat cheese in tomato sauce and burrata avocado toast.  The goat cheese came with very buttery garlic bread for dipping.  The paella was disappointing with burnt bottom and tiny pieces of seafood.  Several more tapas and 2 pitchers of sangria later, the 5 of us still had 17 minutes left on the Hand-Over-Your-Money and Leave meter.  Ok food but not an enjoyable meal.
