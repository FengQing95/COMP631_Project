Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My husband and I each got our own personal pizza. I got a mushroom deep dish with their buttercrust. The pizza was amazing. I am not usually one for deep dish pizza, but this may have converted me. The crust was rolled out thinly (not to be confused with thin crust pizza) and filled with lots of cheese and topped with their delicious tomato sauce.
