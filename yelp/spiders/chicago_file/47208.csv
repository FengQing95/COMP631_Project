Smoque BBQ////Brisket is the best, although I have been known to get the 1/2 brisket and 1/2 pork too, which is equally amazing.  I wouldn't wanna wait in that loooooong line that forms outside during the winter months, but I must say they do their best to move it along rather quickly.  This place usually packed to the brim, but I've never waited longer than 10 minutes for a seat.
