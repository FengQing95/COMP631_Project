Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Much later that evening, after attending the theatre, we grabbed a cab to Bavettes. I called to advise we would be late for our 10P reservation.  It didn't appear to be a problem since when we arrived the restaurant was quite empty.  I'm not sure why this happens, even when a restaurant isn't busy, but the hostess took us to a middle table on the banquette side with people on either side, when a much nice table was available.  She did then move us to the better table, but why wouldn't we go there in the first place?
