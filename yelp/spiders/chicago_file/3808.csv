The Purple Pig////I was in Chicago for a conference and after looking at a reviews we decided to try it out. This is place is a gem! A must visit if you are in Chicago!! Indoor has limited seating and have shared tables. They don't take reservation and usually the wait time is ~1 hour. However, we were lucky and got seated quickly.
