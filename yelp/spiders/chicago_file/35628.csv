Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is an old school swanky joint, to sum it up. The steak did not disappoint and appetizers and sides were first rate. I ordered a gimlet from the cocktail menu and was blown away. The sourdough bread was truly next level and the mashed potatoes left other steak places in the dust. The food lives up to the prices for sure.
