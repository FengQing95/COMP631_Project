Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is one of my favorite places in the city! Although it's usually packed and you may have to wait over an hour without a reservation, it is definitely worth it. I have been here so many times that I have gotten a chance to try almost everything on the menu, and I have yet to find something I don't like. Their sangrias are also fantastic. The atmosphere is very relaxing and the staff is very nice and attentive. This is my go-to spot for any important dinners or celebrations. Can't wait to go back!
