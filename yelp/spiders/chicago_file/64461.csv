Smoque BBQ////The sides are honestly mediocre to "pretty good" at best. The mac and cheese/the fries that I stole from a buddy were probably the top contenders. The brisket chili and coleslaw were kind of a letdown; the coleslaw being almost bland and the brisket chili not bringing anything new to the table.
