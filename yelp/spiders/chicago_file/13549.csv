Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////In Chicago, there are many partisan issues. Cubs versus Sox. Tribune versus Sun-Times. The most important, by far, though, is which of the home-grown pizza institutions has your loyalty. There are many to choose from, Giordano's. Gino's. Bacino's, etc. For me, it is Lou's without question. There is something addictive in their butter crust, but by the time I'm done eating I'm too euphoric and sleepy to question what it is. The cheese is perfectly balanced with the sauce, and the toppings are great. I've received their mail-order pizzas as a gift (delivered to the east coast, carefully packaged) and they cooked up exactly as they do in the restaurant. A couple of less heralded perks are 1) their sweet vinaigrette salad dressing, which they sell by the bottle, and 2) their cookie-in-the-pan dessert. Yum!
