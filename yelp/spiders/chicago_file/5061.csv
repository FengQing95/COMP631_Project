The Purple Pig////Aside: I rarely comment on the service of an eatery bc it's about the food, not having my ego stroked. However I would like to say that it was my last meal in town, and I had brought my luggage bag with me. The host was kind enough to store the bag in a discrete corner during my meal. However, the manager/person walking the floors in glasses took one look at my bag in that corner, sneered and asked what it was doing there. Host said it was a luggage piece, manager sneered again and said "I know, what's that doing there?" And I was right in front of him the whole time. Way to make me feel low and ashamed of being a tourist trying to squeeze in a last good meal before heading to the airport. He was rude and "acted like he owned the joint." The good food and company of my party washed away that horrid encounter Â early on in the night.
