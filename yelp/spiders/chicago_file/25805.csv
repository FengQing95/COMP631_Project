Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visited Chicago for the first time and obviously had to have some of that famous deep dish pizza! We had a long day and decided to order delivery for dinner. We were able to order everything online, did half spinach, half sausage, and it took just about the amount of time to get the food that we were told - which was wonderful.
