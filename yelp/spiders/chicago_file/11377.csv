Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute of Chicago is simply one of the best museums in the world. Hands down, this art museum is not only a treasure for the City of Chicago, this is a treasure for the entire United States. The massive museum sits in Grant Park with the main entrance on Michigan Avenue. The old museum building is joined with the Modern Wing to make an already large collection even larger and more impressive. Admission is very expensive, but you could spend all day here and still be amazed around every corner.
