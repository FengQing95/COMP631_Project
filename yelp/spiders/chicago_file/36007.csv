Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We had to wait for our seats at the bar but it was worthwhile. The drinks, food and service were excellent. We started with some raw east coast oysters - fresh and clean, and tomato salad with super thick bacon - the most scrumptious bacon we've ever had. For the main course, we shared the 22 oz dry aged rib eye steak with bone marrow and wild mushroom - simply impeccable. Make your reservation early!
