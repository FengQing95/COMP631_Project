Little Goat Diner////The only thing we didn't finish was the this little piggy. The French toast was awesomely decadent (gone before even a photo was taken!), the okonomiyaki was light and savory, and the corn was a nice vegetable-ish touch. I wanted to like the this little piggy (kind of a sausage and egg biscuit with a Szechuan riff) but the combination of the Szechuan seasoning and sweetness and strawberries just didn't work for me.
