The Purple Pig////If you love bacon and pates, this is for you!!  I love pork liver pates, and this straight-up tasted like a bacon spread.  The liver taste wasn't too strong and overall this just worked.  With so many pieces of bread they give you for this, it's quite filling (which isn't a bad thing!).
