Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food was okay, if maybe a bit blah, and the serving of it by the busboys was total confusion. The wrapped dates are good (#1 & 67, 67 is better), and the spicy potatoes (#30) are okay. The shortrib stuffed pepper (#4) tasting was great. The empanadas (#52 & 62) are meh - I've had better. The pork belly with beans (#68) was a huge disappointment - it was 99% fat and totally inedible IMHO. The olives (#26) aren't worth $5.
