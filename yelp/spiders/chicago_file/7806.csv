Art Institute of Chicago////One of the best art collections in (dare I say) the world... agreed.  I visit the museum nearly every time I'm in Chicago.  I've been a member; I also have reciprocal membership from my membership at my home art museum.  So I wonder if all of the "front of house" employees got up on the wrong side of the bed this morning ... or what??  Maybe they just feel like they don't need to be helpful or pleasant to visitors because THEY are the ART INSTITUTE of CHICAGO?  Ummm.  Not.
