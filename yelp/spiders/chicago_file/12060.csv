Art Institute of Chicago////Called the best art museum in the world, I agree.  It's a magical place.  Home to some of the most iconic works of art known to human kind, including George Seurat's  Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, American Gothic, Hokusai wave, multiple Chagall masterworks including the series of stained glass windows specifically commissioned for the AIoC.
