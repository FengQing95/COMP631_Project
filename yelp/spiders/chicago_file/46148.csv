Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-ba-reeba always has such high energy, and the ambience is great, so I was looking forward to my upcoming dinner here.  We made a reservation for 10 people on a Saturday night, and believe it or not they sat us immediately upon arrival - a small miracle considering how busy it was (although do make sure all members of your party are there or you're out of luck!).
