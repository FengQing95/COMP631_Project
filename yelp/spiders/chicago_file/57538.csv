Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Paella - our server informed us that the paella is cooked to order, and would take 30-40 minutes to prepare. The paella came out just as we had finished the tapas, and we tried the required minimum 2 servings of the seafood paella and the chicken paella. I really liked the seafood paella but I was already really full and I couldn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked to.
