Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////You walk in and check in your coats and wait for your reservations. The d√©cor is a little ragged imo, but when it's full it's very warm, inviting. Maybe it's just that brick wall takes something away from the beautifully flecked mirrors. Large leather booths surround, while central tables are not cramped. The bar is also open for those seated, it's too fancy a place to hover for orders, you should have your server take care of that part people.
