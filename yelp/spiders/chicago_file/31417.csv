Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The Malnati Chicago Class. Small. Made with Lou's lean sausage, some extra cheese and vint-ripened tomato sauce on butter crust. We ordered a size small and each of us had a quarter of a pizza. The pizza was so thick! One quarter of a deep dish pizza was enough to make all of us full! The crust was so thick and crispy and crunch. The pizza was full of cheese. There were large pieces of sausage in there. The tomatoes were really fresh! Our waitress told us that the way to eat deep dish pizza was to eat with a knife and a fork. And so we did!
