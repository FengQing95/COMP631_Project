Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I'm not sure if it was loud in there or our speaker just spoke softly, but it was a little hard to hear him.  I ordered a few different things off the menu, my friend ordered the chicken paella for two and ate the entire thing.  We ordered a pitcher of the raspberry sangria...it was great!  And...free dessert with yelp check in!
