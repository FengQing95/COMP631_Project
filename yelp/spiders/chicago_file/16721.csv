Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I don't normally leave reviews on yelp, but I thought I should warn anyone considering this restaurant that it will take a sizable chunk of your night. In addition to the upfront wait for a table, it takes them forever to do anything, from serving your food to serving the check. All in all, we got there at 6:30, were seated at 8:00, and left at 9:15, and it doesn't seem like our experience is atypical.
