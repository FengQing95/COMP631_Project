Little Goat Diner////Not sure if some of the reviews are expecting Little Goat to be Girl and the Goat but I found this Diner to be amazing. To drink, I ordered an old fashioned, while is wasn't the best old fashioned I have ever had, it's obvious the bartender is used to making great cocktails. For dinner, I had the "all american burger" while my friend had the mushroom ragu; both tasted amazing. On the side, we also had elotes and while I'm not the biggest fan, the entire plate was gone within 10 minutes. Finally, for desert, we had the sprinkle cake (forgot what the actual name of it) and it was a great way to top off a fantastic dinner!
