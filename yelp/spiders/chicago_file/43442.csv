Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Another discovery I found that night, yeah I kinda felt like the Ponce de Leon of tapas, was that all these small dishes left me feeling right for some dessert.  The thought of ordering a number of small dishes for dessert left me feeling very empowered and indulgent and not at all indecisive.  A few minutes later I had the Gala Apple Empanada, Marcona Almond Caramel Bar and Chocolate Truffle Cake sitting in front of me.  All amazing choices, but the Marcona Almond Caramel Bar left me wanting more...of it.  I shed a brief tear of sadness when the last bite was finished.  I'm actually finding it difficult to finish this review and not go there for that dish.
