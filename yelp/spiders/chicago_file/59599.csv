Smoque BBQ////Smoque is good BBQ, don't get me wrong, but lets be honest, I think all the hype left me disappointed. Smoque appears as if it is a BBQ joint you would find in the Middle of Texas, such as the one on Friday Night Lights, but in my opinion the sauce was just not that great, and sauce makes or breaks the BBQ. The sauce is tangy, which I usually am a fan of but it detracted from the food. I did enjoy the brisket and sausage.
