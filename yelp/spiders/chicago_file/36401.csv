Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////-Chocolate Cream Pie-BEST THING I'VE EVER EATEN. Wow, it was amazing, rich, chocolately, perfection topped with some whipped cream to balance all the richness. You must order this here! It was also a a generous portion, easily to be shared with 4 people but nope, the two of us stuffed it in our fat a$$es.
