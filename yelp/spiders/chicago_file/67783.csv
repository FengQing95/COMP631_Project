Little Goat Diner////Let me first start off by thanking our waitress Christina. She was the perfect level of attentive. Not too much, but not too little. She was very friendly and informative, and seemed like she was able to hold down the section that she had (including us) very well. I am very picky when it comes to waitresses and she did VERY well.
