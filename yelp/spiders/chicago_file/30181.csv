Now the sausage isn't your typical little round balls of sausage that most pizza place use. It's a diff type of sausage. It's actually a whole giant pizza size patty sausage that they layer it on top of the cheese. So there's sausage with every bit you take. The sausage isn't salty like most sausage we use here. Â It's so much better than that.
