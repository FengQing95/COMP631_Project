Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Not really coming for the paella, but loving the tapas! Do yourself a favor and order the seared cana de cabra, this was out of this world, perfectly balanced flavorful! Plato de la casa and papas bravas are good to start it off. Manchego mushrooms are a MUST, even tho they are not selected as house favorites. Get them, no regrets. Not a sangria lover myself but I heard is really tasty.
