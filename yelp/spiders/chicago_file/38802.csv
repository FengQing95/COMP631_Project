Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We ask for recommendations and her starter go-to are the oysters. We happen to love oysters! Yes, let's make it a west coast/east coast oyster battle and we're ready for another round of these old fashioneds. The oysters arrive promptly. They're succulent, sizeable, and fresh. I'm amused they provide Crystals hot sauce--takes me back to time I spent in Metarie.
