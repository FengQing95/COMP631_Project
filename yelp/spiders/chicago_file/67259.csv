Little Goat Diner////Great service from friendly people.  Beautiful decor.  Solid food, but I wish there were some lighter options.  Everything on the menu sounded like it would be something I would regret eating.  I had the whitefish tostadas and I sampled the goat chili, and both were tasty.  My chardonnay was a little bland for $13/glass, but overall a nice outing.
