Little Goat Diner////caleb and i came really hungry but after nibbling appetizers and a cup of soup we anticipated a filling dinner plate so we split a "horseshoe burger": an open face meat patty, topped with smoked fries, then goat chili and drizzled goat cheese. i am a lil apprehensive when it comes to chili but i was sold after one bite of this! the plate was huge so splitting was ideal for our tummies - it was hard to stop eating so splitting was great for quantity control.
