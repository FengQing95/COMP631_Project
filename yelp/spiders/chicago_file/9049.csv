Art Institute of Chicago////One of the best (art) museums in the world. If you have any interest in art, this is the must for your visit to Chicago. Great range of work - there's something for everyone - especially with the new Modern (and contemporary) Wing, which is - in and of itself - quite a sight to see, architecturally speaking. The location is also among the most convenient for most Chicago visitors (a block and a half from the Loop).
