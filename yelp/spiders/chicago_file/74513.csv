Little Goat Diner////OMG this was my first visit to one of the goat trio of restaurants (Girl & the Goat, The Little Goat, Duck duck Goat) and I'm sorry I won't have the opportunity to eat at the other two (or here again). I'm glad I don't live closer or I'd likely be diving into the pork fat home fries, biscuits, SE Asian-inspired breakfast dishes and sandwiches every weekend. Our server was friendly, helpful, patient and offered a variety of suggestions. I'd describe the decor as retro contemporary if such a thing exists. If not, know it's hip and pleasing.
