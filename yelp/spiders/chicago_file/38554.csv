Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////So we just ate here tonight.  We had a reservation for 11 PM.  Knowing that I would probably have a lot to eat I didn't have anything to eat before we got there.  I had two cocktails and was a bit tipsy understandably.  I was not falling or anything like that.  So when I realized that our wine was taking a long time to get to the table, I asked to speak to someone.  I will admit being tipsy and I was a bit awkward walking.  I spoke to the manager and told him the whole situation.  I had eaten my entire steak and side of creamed spinach and obviously felt much better.  He was unwilling to bend for one glass of wine.  The food was delicious but this experience was highly disappointing.
