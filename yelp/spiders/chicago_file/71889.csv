Little Goat Diner////Sunny atmosphere, modern farmhouse decor, service efficient, live action bakery in the back, coffeebar - all makes for a great experience. It makes me want to come here all the time and sit down with a REAL newspaper. I even like the wallpapered wall with the hidden, individual washrooms behind.
