Smoque BBQ////I had the St. Louis half rack for breakfast. It reheated nicely (under a low heat) in my toaster oven. I was surprised that the ends of the ribs were dry, and the center of the rib meat was where you got the best moist and fatty bites of meat. I don't think that my toaster oven is responsible for that. On my next visit, I am going for the leaner baby-back ribs. I'm hoping that the leaner meat will call for a slower heating process, making an evenly moist rack, sides to center.
