Smoque BBQ////Best BBQ place in Chicago. Period.  Exceptional brisket and St.Louis style ribs.  Brisket chili is also worth getting, at the very least in the taste portion.  I would avoid using the sauces provided because the dry rub is plenty flavorful.  Big portions too.  The wait can be a bit of a hassle and establishment is small, but if you want the best BBQ this place is worth it all.
