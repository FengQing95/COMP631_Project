Little Goat Diner////If you're planning to come in for brunch or lunch on a holiday, MAKE RESERVATIONS! Also, make sure you check if they're closing early or not because that's what happened to a lot of people. I had made reservations about a month in advance and we were seated pretty much right away. They were closing early for the Labor Day holiday, so a lot of disgruntled people got turned away at the door.
