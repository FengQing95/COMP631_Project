Smoque BBQ////The good: Great tasting food all around. The variety was fantastic, a little bit of everything. Pulled pork and chili were the highlights for me personally, but everything tasted really good. There was even peach cobbler, which was fantastic. Great value. For catering, they packaged very well.
