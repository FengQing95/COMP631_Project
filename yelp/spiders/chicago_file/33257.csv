Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Took my boyfriend here for his birthday last night & everything was incredible from the complimentary bread to the cappuccinos with dessert! We were seated in a booth downstairs & the ambience was perfect for a date night, very intimate & romantic with a cool speakeasy vibe. We ordered the champagne smash cocktails to start, I'm not a big fan of gin but they were amazing. For dinner I had the petit filet & he ordered the dry aged ribeye & they were some of the best steaks I've ever tasted, so tender & smooth with so much flavor. For sides we had the truffle Mac & cheese which was sooo good, I liked how the truffle flavor was present but not overwhelming like it can be sometimes. We also ordered the wild mushrooms which were also perfect! Our server recommended some very nice Cabernets to have with dinner but I can't remember the names of them. For dessert we had the chocolate cream pie which was delicious but very rich so we could only have a few bites. Also the service was outstanding, our server was so knowledgeable & provided us with absolutely everything we needed & checked in with us at the right times without hovering. I would honestly say this was one of the best restaurants, if not the best, that I've ever been to! If you haven't been here yet make your reservation right now!!! 10/5 stars
