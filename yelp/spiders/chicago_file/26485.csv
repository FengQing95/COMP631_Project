Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Upon planning my trip to Chicago this was theeee place my boyfriend and I wanted get our hands into - deep dish pizza. I don't know what else to say but it is by far the best pizza I've ever had in comparison to the other places we've tried during our stay. The garlic-butter crust was everything. The perfect ratio of cheese and toppings. Service was great! There wasn't much of a wait around the time we had dinner which was about an hour before closing time. Our server was nice and very accommodating and welcoming. We ended up ordering frozen pizza's to bring home which was so worth the wait and getting checked and searched with TSA at the airport.
