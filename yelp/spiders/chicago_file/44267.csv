Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Wow, what a fun place!  I went there last night with 3 friends before we went to Steppenwolf.  Tara, our waitress was great and explained everything to us; which was so helpful.  We had the spinach & goat cheese stuffed mushrooms which were outstanding.  The mushrooms were done just right.  We also had and enjoyed the sirloin, spinach, pepper & onion; and the chicken & chorizo sausage.  The goat cheese & tomato sauce was ok (nothing special about it), but is not one that I would get again as it was not filling.  We had their desserts but the BEST dessert is the macaroon almond & caramel pastry tart.  It's like a "snickers on steroids" (quote from one of the managers).
