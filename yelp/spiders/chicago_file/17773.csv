Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Im from California, and I have to say this pizza was soo good! The portion was big! I shared a Medium one with another friend and we had 3 more slices left over. It was so good, I ordered a personalized portion and brought it back to Cali for my husband! He loved it too. There is a long wait, but it's worth it!
