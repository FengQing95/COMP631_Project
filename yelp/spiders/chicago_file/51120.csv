Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I feel that the flavor was lacking in a lot of the dishes we tried.  The only thing I really enjoyed were the dates and the service is pretty great too.  I was trying not to compare it to another Spanish restaurant that I love, but the Spanish restaurant that I love won hands down.
