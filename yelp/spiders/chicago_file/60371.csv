Smoque BBQ////Both the guys working out the seating arrangements and the folks at the counter were very polite and cordial, and this was a pleasant surprise.  You would not expect this at a place that has a line from open to close every day.  You folks at the DMV (who no doubt read Yelp religiously) could learn something.
