Little Goat Diner////Best dishes: The fried chicken with biscuit and mashed potatoes will melt your brain. So. Damn. Good. The Bullseye French Toast levels-up your brunch options by playing on the ol' chicken and waffles favorite. The corned beef hash is your salty hangover cure. P.S. Get a cinnamon roll, if for no other reason, to eat the cream cheese frosting. *praise hands*
