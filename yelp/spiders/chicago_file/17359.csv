Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I just want to go on the record and say, Chicago style pizza is not very good (Chicago pride keeps many from speaking up about such a touchy subject), BUT if you're going to get pizza thats not wood or coal fired, get Lou's. Their crust is the best, and really just in general the ingredients are better (referring to Gino's, Giordanos, etc). Get the cookie pizza desert. They say money can't buy happiness, but I don't think whoever said that tried a cookie pizza here.
