Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The waiter came by to greet me and take my drink order. I wanted the Barbera d'alba and asked if it came by the glass. I was told no, so I asked for the bottle ($67) ... Not intending to drink the whole thing (attending a conference and dining alone), but that was the wine I wanted and told the waiter it was my favorite (see previous reviews). He refused, and told me I had to order wine by the glass. I was embarrassed, and instead of leaving in a huff, I complied.
