Art Institute of Chicago////My main goal was to see the new Modern Wing. A friend and I must have wandered around that wing for well over an hour. I enjoy looking at paintings with her because she is the one that knows the eras and 'isms. Â The Modern Wing is gorgeous and I finally got to see what everyone was talking about.
