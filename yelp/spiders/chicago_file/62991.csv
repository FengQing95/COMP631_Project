Smoque BBQ////Great Place! Great Service, and the food was delicious! Their mac and cheese is amazing, and The cashier was very patient, as I had never been there before and my family had PLENTY of questions. The food was prepared in a timely manner, the restaurant itself is on the small side but very clean and has a nice vibe to it.
