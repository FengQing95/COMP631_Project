Smoque BBQ////Took a seat (the fact that they have someone greet you, let you order, then seat you is a little weird, but is a necessary protocol for maintaining order when the place gets busier), and it didn't take long for our number to get called (maybe 5-7 minutes; they seemed to be filling a lot of carryout orders). Â Ran up, hooked up the grub.
