Smoque BBQ////Finally took a little trip to Smoque BBQ on a Sunday afternoon (11:45am) and it was busy but not lines out the door busy. Â Was able to find parking in the back lot. Big blackboard for the menu. Boyfriend and I ordered the St. Louis Ribs and Brisket. I am in love with the Brisket! This was my 1st time trying it and not my last! Soo yummy and tender, melt in your mouth good! The ribs were pretty yummy too but I have had other ribs that I like better. Sides got the mac and cheese it was yummy, fries were good too! Tried the peach cobbler.. didn't really care for it but my boyfriend enjoyed it. The seating is kind of cramped but they do a good job of seating people.
