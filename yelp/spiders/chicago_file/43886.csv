Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////For food we went ahead with the spicy potatoes which were fantastic! I expected that, but I really enjoyed these. We ordered a second round! My friends got plenty of meat (!) including chicken skewers and beef. They really enjoyed it. I also went ahead with the garlic potato salad. Weird, not too bad. After a round of food we ended up ordering two more pitchers of sangria including the Mango and The Classic. I felt that after awhile the drinks dwindled in alcohol content. Fortunately I was having a blast and didn't mind it.
