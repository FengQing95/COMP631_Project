Art Institute of Chicago////The museum houses the best collection of American art I have ever seen spanning our nation's entire history. Once you are done with that section, why not spend hours in the Impressionist section drooling over some of the best art outside Paris. Still have time, take some time to see the entire Modern Art wing. Is it snowing yet? OK, stay warm with the Asian and Middle Eastern artworks or maybe the architecture and furniture sections. Do not forget to play Ferris Bueller and stare at Seurat contemplating your place in the universe or maybe sneak a kiss by the blue windows.
