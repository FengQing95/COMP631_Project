Smoque BBQ////The biggest disappointment for me was the lady that took our order. (And I would have overlooked this if the food had blown us away.) There was only one other customer in the entire place; she was not busy. It was obvious we had never been there before from our confusion as to where the menu was (blackboard on wall) and to our discussion on which sides to choose. She neither offered her suggestions nor conversed in anyway besides asking "What would you like?" If you're going to have someone interact with customers and take orders, have them be a bit personable and friendly.
