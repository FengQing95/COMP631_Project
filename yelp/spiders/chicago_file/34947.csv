Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Oh my Gosh. This place is our new favorite. It was so hard to get a reservation here- I think I made our Friday night reservation two weeks prior and the only slot open was 11pm, but it was totally worth it!!we showed up about ten min early and had a lovely drink at the bar, myself a French martini, my boyfriend, and old fashioned. Bar tender was efficient and hospitable but not hovering. Super classy, speak easy vibe... sexy dim lighting, chandeliers and oriental area rugs, cozy booths with single candles, a slim, but fulfilling menu. I had a half bottle of pino Grigio that was delightful... the sourdough bread and salted butter served with dinner were homemade and delightful. My steak was out of this world! I had a filet Mignon with a side of the creamed spinach. I literally will dream about how good it was! Haha. My boyfriend had the New York strip and was very impressed. We also got the Brussels sprouts and demolished every bite! The steaks came with bernaise sauce and seasoning salt that was delicious! For dessert, I had a cappuccino and brown sugar ice cream with hot fudge..um, YES! Our waiter was professional and prompt. Truly in love with this place.
