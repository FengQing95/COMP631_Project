Little Goat Diner////Here's the service rant so skip this (rather long) paragraph if you just care about the food.... Came in for brunch, had a little wait so grabbed coffee next door at little goat bread and was seated shortly after... During this time, the coffee lid had popped off twice spilling really hot coffee so when we sat down I asked for a mug that I could pour my coffee into.  The waiter grabs my cup and walks off with it and reappears several minutes later with two coffee mugs with black coffee (note my friend didn't order coffee and I really just wanted the full cup of coffee I had just bought in a mug).  He sets the mugs in front of us and walks off.... So several minutes later when he walks by again I ask for milk and sugar and he's like fine but there's sugar right in front of you and before I can clarify that I wanted the fake stuff he walked away again.  Came back again several minutes later with the milk and I asked him for the truvia which took another few minutes to grab a couple packets of sugar... Rinse and repeat this several minute long fiasco for a second time with coffee refills, during which time he told me he heard me ask for milk (even though he walked by several times and never bothered to drop it off). Basically I had cold coffee with breakfast with a side of major attitude, and messing with coffee in the morning is like messing with alcohol during happy hour, it's just not done.  If he hadn't been so dismissive and a little nicer I probably would have given him a pass since I've been on the other side of the counter and understand the breakfast rush, but he seriously put a damper on my Saturday morning.
