Little Goat Diner////Today, I got a couple of Conchas and chocolate croissant with vanilla latte.  This croissant was definitely one of a kind.  In love with chocolate croissant, I have tried it from a lot of places I think this is arguably the best I have tried.  My wife agrees, too.  Also, latte was not too sweet but quite tasty.
