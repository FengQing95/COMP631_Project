Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////What can I say?  Yummy on top of delicious yummy.  We arrived at 5:30 and were able to sit on the patio.  Because of a first check-in on Four Square we received a free pintxos platter.  Very good.  We shared a 1/2 pitcher of passion fruit sangria.  I think we could have drunk 2 pitchers, it was so refreshing and smooth.  For dinner, we had chicken paella, rioja braised short ribs with mash potatoes, meatballs, and chicken empanadas.    Good, good, and good!  I've eaten at other tapas restaurants here and in Atlanta and this was the best I've had so far.
