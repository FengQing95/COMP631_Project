Smoque BBQ////Dee-lish!!  It soooo good I crave it, and I don't crave anything.  Home made everything, coleslaw, cornbread, and macaroni and cheese are to die for.  They do have a small dining area but always seat everyone in a short time.  They're only open until ten so I have tried to sneak in late a few times, but it's always packed until closing.  Since I heard about it I've been there at least once a week.  I'm just happy it's so close to my house!!
