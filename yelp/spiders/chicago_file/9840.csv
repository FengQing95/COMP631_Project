Art Institute of Chicago////As for those two majestic beasts that do not roam, but rather, forever faithfully guard the Michigan Avenue entrance to the treasures housed within this building that is itself a treasure...the "Wreathing of the Lions" pays them homage & kicks off the Holiday season. Â This event, held annually the day after Thanksgiving, is a joy, as was the "scavenger hunt, 2012" throughout the museum that had us (yes, adults) searching through galleries for clues to fill in missing letters that ultimately formed a festive word. This activity was an excellent way to foster interaction amongst museum-goers as well as to encourage ventures to galleries as yet unvisited. It truly acquainted us with the vastness of this fine museum's collections as well as promoted the Spirit of the Season!
