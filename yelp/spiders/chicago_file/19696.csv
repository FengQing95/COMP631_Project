Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you never had deep dish pizza, this is the spot to come to for authentic Chicago pizza.  The wait time can be long, average 1-2hrs, but it is worth it for a taste of Chicago!  During your wait time, take a look at their menu and place your pizza order as soon as you can, well before you think you will be seated.  The pizza takes 30 minutes to make, so they will time it such that right when you get a table your pizza will be almost ready.  At this point you will be starving from waiting over an hour and looking at everyone else eating delicious pies.
