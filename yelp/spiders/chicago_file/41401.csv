Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Yummy tapas, we had an early reservation but as we were slowing down, the server came around numerous times, and me and my friends were just wondering what was up. Then it clicked as we walked outside, there was quite a long line outside. Granted we did not sit here for 2+ hours, I think we were only there for a little over an hour.
