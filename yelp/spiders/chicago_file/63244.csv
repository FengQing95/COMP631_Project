Smoque BBQ////So we ordered a buffet from here for my parent's anniversary... We had both ribs, pulled pork, brisket and texas sausage.  We also had all the sides and cornbread. Everything was delicious as always.. brisket was extra yummy..  I did notice that the beans were a tad more watery/vinegary then usual and so was the coleslaw. They were both still very good but I think since they packed them in large tubs they lost some of there charm...
