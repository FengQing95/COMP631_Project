Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Had such fun at Ba-Ba-Reeba the other night!  Atmosphere is lively ~~ we ate on the outside patio and felt very much in the mood of the restaurant.  The food was delicious; a pitcher of red Sangria; and one of their tiny and Yum (!) desserts ~~ perfect!  I am looking forward to our next visit.
