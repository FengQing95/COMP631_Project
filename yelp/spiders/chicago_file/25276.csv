Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When in Chicago here is the place to go for deep dish pizza! The butter crust is the bomb and their sauce is the best. I really love their salads as well and they are huge. The service is great each time I have been here when visiting Chicago, even when they are extremely busy. I highly recommend Lou Malnati's for pan pizza. I'll keep coming back each time we're out that way as there's no other place like it I've found!
