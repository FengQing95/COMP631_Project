Little Goat Diner////Adjacent to the Little Goat Diner is the Alcove of Little Goat Bread and Coffee. The baked goods busines goes from 6am to 6pm though inside the space isalso the bar which has it's own menu and drinks till 2am. Thrre's also the Private Kitchen which is above eerything. Kind of interesting they basically have four busiess running out of one big building. Back to the bread, they habe all the baked goods for all their other businesses, and an order ahead program.  They also sell Stumptown coffee out of Portland and make great espresso drinks.  While we were waiting for our goods, chef Stephanie came from upstairs and stopped by the coffee bar for a few minutes, She's a petite one! I guess next time im inthe area, the Bar is the last of the group that i have to hit.
