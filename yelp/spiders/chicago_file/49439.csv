Smoque BBQ////Look the BBQ is pretty average but  better than most if you are in Chicago.  Nobody here seems capable of good sauce or smoky meat texture.  This was pretty decent but a little fatty in most cuts, brisket should not be so moist, its like a sponge but tastes ok.  The sauce is woefully lacking with the sweetness of candy.  But on the plus side the fries are  really really good.  But above all the Peach cobbler IS THE TRUTH,  it is insanely good, crunchy with a good glaze on the outside with perfect solid peach baked in to perfection.  I would pay 12 bucks for that thing, 2 dollars is the deal of the century.  I cannot overstate how amazing it is.The staff is also very friendly and the restaurant itself is very comfortable. A good stop if your in the mood for BBQ.
