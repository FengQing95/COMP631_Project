Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////A star is deducted because a server led the couple before us to their table, then left us waiting for a good 15 to 20 minutes.  I inquired with the greeter about our table.  A small table magically became available instantaneously.  It seemed to me that the vacant table had been available, yet the servers were too busy to let the greeter know, so we waited longer at the front unnecessarily.
