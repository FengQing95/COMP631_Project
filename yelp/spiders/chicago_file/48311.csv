Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great place for a date. Made a reservation and requested a quieter table and although Â the whole restaurant is pretty loud, I got put in a quieter corner, which was nice. Got free freshly baked bread but had to resist not eating all the bread in order to have room for the tapas. Ordered 5 tapas and received 1 free dessert tapa for checking into Yelp for 2 people which was more than enough. Everything was delicious but my favorite was the patatas bravas!
