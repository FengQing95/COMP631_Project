Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Overall, I think there are very small differences in the many deep dish pizzas in Chicago. However, I would say that Lou's is my favorite (although, due to the proximity to my apartment, it is not my go-to). The ingredients are quality, the pricing is very fair, and the overall experience (besides the long expected wait times) is consistent and good. So if you're in need of a decent deep dish offering, I would definitely recommend giving Lou Malnati's a try.
