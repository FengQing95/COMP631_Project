Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I can't think of anything negative things to say about this place because it was just that great! Â I have only been once but I can't wait to go back. The food was absolutely delicious and even on a busy Friday night the service was excellent. We ordered two pitchers of sangria (one mango and one classic red) and we were not disappointed. We came for a quick bite before a night out and only ordered a few of the menu items.I recommend the Moroccan spiced lamb kebab, garlic shrimp, fried calamari, goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, and the sangria!
