Little Goat Diner////This place was booming on a Wednesday mid-morning for brunch and lunch. To be fair it's the holidays but I couldn't believe how many people were lined up for early lunch. I can see why - it's an impressive and interesting menu that takes risks and incorporates flavored from around the world. I landed on the chocolate crunch pancakes and convinced my lunch buddy to split her savory French toast. Both were really tasty although I won't say my mind was blown like some of the other reviews. The crunch was a bit odd, but the pancakes were some of the best I've ever had. The atmosphere is lively and welcoming and the service pretty good. The French toast with bites of fried chicken also pleased the taste buds. Definitely a spot worth checking out and reasonably priced overall.
