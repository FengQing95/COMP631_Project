Smoque BBQ////The BBQ sauce: I really enjoyed the Memphis style sauce, though it may have been just a tad spicier than I like my BBQ sauce to be (I much prefer a sweet sauce, and Memphis is typically on the sweeter side, so I was surprised that it wasn't as sweet). However, I wasn't a fan of the Carolina BBQ sauce at all. I like that they were clearly labeled, and even gave some direction for which sauce to put on which meats. They recommended putting the Carolina on the brisket, but I'm glad I just dipped a tiny bit to try it first, because my food would've been ruined had I put all the Carolina sauce on my brisket. Waaaaay too much vinegar for me (I know, that's how Carolina sauce is supposed to be...but still, it wasn't good).
