Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is a great place to bring out of town guests or to impress friends when it's your turn to choose a food spot. I love the concept of tapas/small plates because you're not committed to one dish for the entire meal (which sucks if it's a total fail, but you have to stick with it because it's a huge portion.)
