Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////3 stars specifically because our waiter was really sweet and took the awful shrimp and grits off our bill. This place is so overrated. Breakfast paella really missed the mark. This place is a perfect example of the mediocrity of Lincoln Park at its finest. The yuppies can have it.
