Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is a really fun place for brunch just because there are so many tapas options that you can go with! At the same time, the menu can be quite overwhelming, again because of the number of options. My favorites were the citrus french toast, the short rib sliders, the serrano ham eggs benedicts, and the spinach and artichoke crepe. We got a ton of other tapas which were also fantastic but these were probably the ones I would definitely order again. A few of us also split a pitcher of the pear sangria which was a sweet sangria but it didn't really taste very much like pear unfortunately.
