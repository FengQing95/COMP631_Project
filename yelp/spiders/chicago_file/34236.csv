Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food was excellent - We all thought it was delicious and flavorful.  I was expecting to request salt and pepper, but none was necessary.  Our waiter, Brandon, was great and so were all of our servers.  The ambiance in the basement was intimate and the seating was super cozy.  Definitely recommend!
