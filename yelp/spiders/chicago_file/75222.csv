Little Goat Diner////Ate okonomiyako. Yummy. Very eggy. Tried the French toast which was delicious - not quite sweet and had a salty taste to it. Very unique. The Cinnabon we thought would be warm and soft, but it was cold and a bit dried up.. so not as fresh as we would like. The goat marketing is awesome. Just love seeing the goat figure everywhere. My friend ended up getting one of their beanies.
