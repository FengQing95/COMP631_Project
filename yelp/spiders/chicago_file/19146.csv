Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After settling on Lou's (since my Mom saw it on the Food Network recently) and being completely famished (having run the Urbanathalon earlier that morning) we got there and waited.   Which I can deal with since this place does have things thought out, as while you are waiting you have already ordered the nommy pizza and it is in the oven beginning the process to heading to your eventually to be allocated table.
