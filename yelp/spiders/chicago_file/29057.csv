Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou malnati came highly recommended via YELP and as YELP has never steered me wrong, I decided Lou Malnati's will be my Chicago pizza experience. As I walked up to the much anticipated pizza place, my heart sank... There was a mob of people waiting already... Boo boo... Ok... My fault for going at prime dinner time 630PM...so, I put my name on the wait list and grabbed a drink at the bar. The bar is not big but it is sufficient. The beers ranged in variety from local brews to domestics and the prices are good...
