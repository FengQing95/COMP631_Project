Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We are from out of town so naturally we had to get a deep dish pizza. Upon our arrival to Lou Malnati's (we sat at the bar due to a half hour wait time), the server at the bar quickly explained to us that the pizza would take 45 minutes to make and that we should get their salad to start. Boom. Easy for us. Good to know right off the bat in case you're in a time crunch. We first enjoyed a salad with hard salami pieces, Gorgonzola, tomato, and a sweet vinaigrette dressing. Then our original pizza came out. The crust was perfectly cooked. The mozzarella cheese was thick and gooey. The sauce was smothered over the top and there was slightly spicy sausage inside. I was more than pleased with the meal and the overall experience. I would recommend this place to tourists looking for some classic deep dish pizza, but make sure you have time to sit and enjoy it and an empty stomach because man it is filling!
