Art Institute of Chicago////I was awed at all the amazing Impressionist Art at the Art Institute Chicago. Each room was a treasure trove of amazing art. I had missed the museum the last time I was in Chicago but all the impressionist art was on loan to a museum in Texas. I was disappointed, but kept it on my to-do list and was finally able to see it on a recent visit. After passing the two huge bronze lions that flank the Michigan Avenue entrance we made our way to the entrance and grabbed a couple of maps. These were definitely needed as The Art Institute Chicago offers almost a million square feet to explore! It is 3 floors and huge. Definitely need a plan on what you want to see. On the back of the map was a list of some of the highlights of the museum and things you didn't want to miss. Even broke it down depending on how many hours you had. I thought that was brilliant and very helpful. Of course I wanted to start with the Impressionist art which was in a section they called European Art before 1900. Once we found our way there, we wandered through several sections of art by my favorite Claude Monet, as well as Georges Seurat, Vincent van Gogh, Alfred Sisley, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Eugène-Louis Boudin, Paul Gauguin, Paul Cézanne, Édouard Manet, as well as many others. I was in heaven and awed every time we stepped into another room. There we so many to see, I couldn't even name my favorites. However, they did have a lot of Monet's from his house in Giverny and a few haystacks. Always cool to see. We also spent some time in their Contemporary Art section.  It was quite interesting and they had a lot of Andy Worhol who I really like too. There was so much to see and do at the Art Institute Chicago that we didn't have as much time to see all that we wanted to, but we hit the highlights. The only thing I wasn't impressed with was how they treated us as they were closing. About 15 minutes before they closed they started shooing us out and even locked the bathrooms. We were told that they would be open on the main floor by the gift shop, but they weren't. Very frustrating. Still it was a great museum and I would love to explore more on a future trip to Chicago. Definitely make sure the Art institute Chicago is on your list.  Please read my travel blog post for more information about the museum and our visit. Happy Travels.
