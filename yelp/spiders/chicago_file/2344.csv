The Purple Pig////2 years have gone by since my last review and I still adore the Purple Pig. I always, always bring people here (most recently family and they loved it too). There doesn't seem to be any bad plates and in fact each plate seems better than the last. By now, I've had a good majority of items on the menu so I can truly say that it's totally worth your dollars to stop by.
