Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I really didn't notice any sauce underneath my tomatoes, and from what I read in other reviews the sauce layer is pretty thin. But what amount there is, I was happy with it because I felt that the pie had a great amount of depth in flavor and seasoning. Lots of different notes going on.
