Smoque BBQ////Sweet Jesus! I haven't reviewed Smoque yet? Well, it all started at a friend's birthday party, well it wasn't his birthday, but his daughter's. Anyway, he told me about this wonderful place that sold amazing bbq and brisket. He even had some at the party, what luck! I tried the brisket and it was amazing. The mac and cheese...mouthwatering. I had to have more. I had to be sure it wasn't a fluke.
