Smoque BBQ////I, of course, didn't finish my plate and amazingly, neither did my bf (what?), which was surprising so I took a few slices of brisket, some pulled pork, 1/2 of my mac & cheese and cornbread on the plane trip back home. My flight was delayed so I'm at Midway sitting at gate 10, concourse B when my stomach growls. I pull out my take out box, open it and pinch off a piece of brisket and as I'm getting ready to put it in my mouth, the guy sitting next to me says "that smells amazing, did you get that here in the airport and I'm like, no, my bf & I visited Smoque BBQ on N. Pulaski Road earlier today and these are the leftovers that are going home with me". Needless to say, he looked disappointed that he wasn't going to be able to go get some and I certainly wasn't sharing mine with him.
