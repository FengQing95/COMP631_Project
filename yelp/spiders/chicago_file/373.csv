Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////My favorite breakfast dish is a skillet and no restaurant does it better than Wildberry.  I go out of my way to have it every once in a while.  The food is always fresh and delicious.  If only there was a location in Chicago away from tourist town so I didn't have to wait.
