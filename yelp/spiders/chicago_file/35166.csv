Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Love the ambiance of this restaurant. Came here for a fancy date night quite a bit ago, but it sticks out in my mind. We were seated downstairs, and walked through the 20s themed area on the main floor, which was beautiful. Downstairs was much cozier, which on a date, was perfect! We ate some amazing food, the boy had a delicious drink. The beef I had felt like it was melting in my mouth it was so tender. Would definitely recommend for a fancy night out on the town.
