Little Goat Diner////We were seriously let down by the cluster of hosts in the front of the restaurant.  We arrived a little after 6 on Saturday and were told it would be about 30-40 min. for a table, which was fine.  We put our name in and grabbed a drink at Maude's down the street. The text we received said it would be 45-1hr for our wait.  When we hit the 45 min mark we decided to walk back to the restaurant and wait for our table.  After a few min we were ushered to the back of the restaurant for "the best table in the house." The hostess explained that you could see the entire restaurant from this booth in the back.  We were almost there when she stopped, turned around and apologized because another couple was being seated at our table.  The hostess reassured us that we would be taken care of.  We walked back to the front and they told us it would be another 15 min.  We waited another 20 min and we received another text message saying that our table was ready so we walked up to the hostess again where she then said that it would be another 5 min because the communal tables in the front were being held for a large party and that a booth would open up soon....which did in the very front of the restaurant as close to the door as possible.  Every time the door spun I got an ice cold breeze up my skirt.  At that point I realized that there was no point in saying something.
