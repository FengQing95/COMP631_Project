Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The steaks at Bavette's are top notch. But I am personally just as wowed, if not more so, by their sides! The creamed spinach is a must-order, as is the wedge salad. In the spinach, I always taste either gruyere or bleu cheese - I can't figure out which - and it lends such richness and depth of flavor to the dish. The wedge salad is outstanding, and features a ranch-like dressing (not too thick, just right) that lightly coats the lettuce, and is complemented by a generous sprinkle of fresh herbs and thick slabs of very high-quality bacon. You can tell the dressing has quite a bit of garlic in it, but it's not overpowering. I've tried to replicate it at home from a recipe I saw on Serious Eats, and it's definitely close, but the restaurant's still can't be beat!
