Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Well let me start by saying this is my first Chicago deep dish, and I loved  it. Real busy resturant even on a Sunday. Was told the wait would  be 1 hr. I like the notification system for sitting patrons. Give you the ability to go  look around the city while you wait. But it was racing so I didn't. We ended up getting some  help from a hostess from upstairs and only waited 30 mins. Great customers  service up until we sat down.
