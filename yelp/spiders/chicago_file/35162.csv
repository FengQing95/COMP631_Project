Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Both of our filets, the corn & loaded baked potatoes were so amazing there are hardly words to describe our meals.  Our drinks were amazing, old-fashions and sazeracs, made in front of us with all the works.  And the whiskey ice cream with dark chocolate sauce was the BEST dessert ever!!
