Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Thanks for making my deep-dish pizza experience a great one! My colleague and I were in town for a convention so having a Chicago style pizza was an order. We dined here on 3/9/17 and though this is my first deep-dish pizza experience, it is save to say that their pizza is bomb based on the quality of the crust, sausage and the sauce. Beware that they make the pizzas to order so you'll have to wait 30 minutes for it to come. We occupied ourself with a house salad (the single order is plenty to share between two people) and we also ordered the deep fried calamari for app and it was tasty, the batter was crunchy but the squid itself was tender (yay it wasn't a frozen calamari that comes in a bag!) I'm more of a thin crust pizza person, however, Lou Malnati did their job of convincing me that there are other ways to have your pizza! :) I'm craving their pizza just from writing this review
