Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We cooked the second pizza tonight and I tried to keep an open mind about it.  Last time, when I received the pizzas, I thought there wasn't any cheese on them because all I saw was sauce.  So, I added cheese on top, along with more toppings.  Maybe that's why it turned out soggy - the additional cheese I put on it prevented moisture from evaporating from the sauce when it was cooked.
