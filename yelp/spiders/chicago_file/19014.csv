Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////"Illuminati???" - No, "Lou Malnati".  The number one repeated recommendation from Chicagoans (Chicagans? Chicagies? .....pizza boasters extraordinaire).  So we strolled on over to one of their many locations.  Lemme tell ya, about three dozen other people had the same Saturday night dinner plan ( - das how you know eez gooood - ).  We put our name in for the hour wait and then perched like comfortable little vultures around the bar - hovering over every stool with pending check.
