Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////It doesn't take long to notice that this is a favorite restaurant in the cute area of Lincoln Park. It is huge too. I sat in the dining area, but of course there is a bar area and possibly a private room? My waitress knew the menu well, and was happy to share details on everything wile spending time with us as the otehr tables were also busy.
