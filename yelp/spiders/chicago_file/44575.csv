Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Reservations are a pain in the A. They book up immediately but they take walk-ins, which means you may have had to fight for a res time that doesn't seem that busy. More likely though, it will be crowded as sh*t when you get here, even if it's a Tuesday at 9pm. This place is popular.
