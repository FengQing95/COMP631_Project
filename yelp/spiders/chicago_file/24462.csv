Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Unfortunately, I will not be describing any such experience with this sort of intensity. First, the pros - for a Friday night in Chicago, when both 40,000 oncology professionals were in town as well as countless others for a Taylor Swift concert, I was extremely pleased that our party of four only encountered a 15-minute wait. The decor was very authentic, warm, and inviting, and our waitress was very friendly and helpful. She happily split our bill four ways, even allowing us to separate out the alcohol on another check (we needed to do this for reimbursement purposes).
