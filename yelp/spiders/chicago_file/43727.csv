Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been coming to this restaurant for years. I always recommend this place to my friends and co-workers. I decided to celebrate my birthday party at the restaurant for 12 people. I made the reservations for 8:30. We did not get seated until about 9:20!! We kept asking the hostess why it was taking to long and they kept telling us "Almost ready" and that "their getting the table ready" at 8:45, 9:00, and 9:15 pm. I informed the waitress that I had a table reserved at 11 pm at a local nightclub. So I did not want to rush dinner. She said she "understood".
