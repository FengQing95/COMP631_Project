The Purple Pig////Wow! Wow! Wow! So glad our plans got a little messed up and we ended up here early this passed Saturday. Everything we put in our mouths was 5 Stars. The only problem you will have here is deciding what to order. We ordered the whipped feta- oh man still tasting this dish. The broccoli- yep broccoli was a favorite. Julienned fried pig ears with the pickled peppers- pork shoulder- and stuffed squid were all home runs. Don't let the communal tables scare you away from dining here- everyone's faces are down in their plates so you don't have to make eye contact if you don't want to. So Amazing we have figured a way to come here for a quick day trip from RI for brunch in March- yes a 12 Hour trip just to eat here again.
