Art Institute of Chicago////My highschool teacher for AP European History took us here on a field trip once, and told us about how the museum was originally founded via Potter Palmer's (of Palmer House Hilton fame) wife's art collection. Apparently she was a big fan of French impressionism as well as a personal friend of Mary Cassat. So when she died, she willed that her collection be made public - which is why the museum is full of so much badass impressionist stuff.
