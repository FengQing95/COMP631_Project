Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place is awesome! Went with some friends to Chicago who had never been there and wanted to find a great steak place. Â Everything we ordered was great, from the decor and music to the butter and bread to the chocolate mousse cake and everything in between. The waiter was a character, our table was well attended to. I am not a fan of oysters but my husband insisted I try one of the eastern ones that he ordered, which I must say was dillish. Yes, this is not an inexpensive place to dine, but well worth the experience we had.
