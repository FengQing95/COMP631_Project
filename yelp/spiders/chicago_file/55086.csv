Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here because my date really wanted tapas. Maybe Im just not a tapas connoisseur but I thought everything was fine but nothing particularly stood out. We got a pork dish and it was a bit dry, the meat was too hard. I couldn't even remember the other tapas we ordered...The dining experience itself was also sub par. The restaurant was very crowded and quite loud. Probably won't be coming again.
