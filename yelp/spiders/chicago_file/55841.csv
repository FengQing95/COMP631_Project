Smoque BBQ////I had the 1/2 Brisket 1/2 Pulled Pork dinner with Cornbread and BBQ Beans with a Peach Cobbler to finish. The pulled pork was decent but the brisket was amazing. I feel like I had never eaten brisket before Smoque! The beans and cornbread were good, but have I talked about the brisket yet??
