Little Goat Diner////This restaurant has great small things that make a big difference for foodies. Â REAL maple syrup, kale, goat's milk, and real homemade pancakes that aren't so thick that they look and taste like a piece of cake. The eggs are far from boring and are seasoned and cooked to perfection! The wait isn't too bad and the service is great!
