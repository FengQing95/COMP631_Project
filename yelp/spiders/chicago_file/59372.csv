Smoque BBQ////I went to Smoque on a work lunch trip with a vendor and was amazed at how packed the place was. It was kind of ridiculous. Good thing we had reserved a table! The line was very long and the wait was somewhat agonizing, since the aroma of brisket and pulled pork wafted everywhere and I was starving! Finally, we were served our food. We were cramped at the table, literally rubbing shoulders with each other, but that didn't matter so much to me, the food was excellent. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and it was very good. Came with fries and cole slaw.
