Little Goat Diner////The overall impression I get from the place is just a good effort that misses the mark.  There are glaring holes missing and it's just disappointing that the effort to fix them isn't there.  You expect that with Izard helming the ship everything would be just right but it's not.  It's more a place to eat and be seen than a foodie paradise.  Unfortunately this place is more hype than substance but I respect what it's trying to do.
