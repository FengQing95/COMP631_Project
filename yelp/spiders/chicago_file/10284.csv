Art Institute of Chicago////I love this place. I really do! I've gone to the Art Institute quite a number of times and I'm always so pleased! If you're a Bank of America user, you can get free admission the first weekend of every month. I've loved the Magritte exhibit they've had and they sometimes include video productions. It can take from an hour to three hours to explore the place! On weekends it does get crowded so you can check out the entrance to the side (not the main one). Highly reocmmend if you're in Chicago!
