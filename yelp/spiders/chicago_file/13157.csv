Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Why can't we have these in California?!? I guess then it wouldn't be considered Chicago deep dish, my point is that I love this place. My first time with Lou was when it was shipped out to me in Los Angeles, even frozen and heated in my own oven it was delicious, but nothing compares to the fresh one. Everything couldn't be more harmonious, the tomatoes in the sauce has a perfect sweetness that compliments the saltiness of the cheese and meats, and oh that crust. I still don't understand how the bottom remains crispy and not soggy. I eat and eat and it makes me sad that I can only fit 2 slices in my belly. The most amazing part of the whole experience is that this pizza tastes fresh and never greasy, it truly couldn't be more distinct!
