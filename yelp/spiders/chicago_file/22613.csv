Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have to come here every time I'm in Chicago. It IS worth the 45-50 minute wait. I was pleased at how smooth the hostess was handling the crowd. We added our name on the list along with a number for them to text us when our table was ready. The best part was that there was a little link we could click on when we first got a confirmation text that shows us what place in line we're in. This was perfect because we didn't want to get caught up with all the shopping so it was nice to see. I'm literally writing this review with my mouth watering as I'm yearning for a deep dish slice of pizza from Lou's with all my heart. The Cobb salad I believe it was is heavenly and a perfect salad to share with your table. The next thing we shared was garlic bread with the marinara sauce. The marina sauce that they offer is not your basic sauce from the jar. You can tell this was handcrafted with love because there was something very special in there and it was quite addicting. Next up is the pizza of course. One slice was heavy enough to keep me full and satisfy my needs.
