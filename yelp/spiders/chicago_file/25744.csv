Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Deep dish pizza is great (as far as deep dish is concerned), however the amount of sauce on the pizza was ridiculously heavy. Maybe that's the way they do it in Chicago? Also I along with two of the other folks in my party couldn't taste the pepperoni in our personal pizzas because they were extremely thin cut. However, my father in laws pizza was great - lots of sausage on his pizza.
