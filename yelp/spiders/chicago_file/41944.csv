Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Okay, on to the food.  Stuffed Mushrooms, fantastic.  Rioja Braised Short Rib with Manchego Mashed Potatoes, UNBELIEVABLE!  Platter of Spanish Cured meats and cheese with Tomato Bread, pretty great, but I couldn't stop thinking that perhaps a restaurant that wasn't a chain would have done this even better. Also the pork kabob with spicy potatoes was overdone and rather tasteless, a huge disappointment since this was my fave on my first visit,  Overall, I think this shows that the food is largely hit or miss.
