Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute of Chicago has a number of well-known works and artists on display - American Gothic, Nighthawks, several by Andy Warhol, several by Picasso, Dali, an entire room of Monet, Seurat's Sunday Afternoon on La Grande Jatte, works by Rothko and Max Ernst are on display, several by Jackson Pollack, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's At the Moulin Rouge, which has particular significance for us. Three months earlier, we went to an exhibit at the Musee d'Orsay in Paris called the "Splendors and Misery of Prostitution", which had this painting on display and was also presented on all of the marketing materials for the exhibit. We weren't allowed at that exhibit to photograph any of the paintings so we felt like we had a small victory in being able to photograph it here. There were many areas of the museum we didn't have time to see, but I'd recommend spending a few hours if you find yourself in Chicago.
