Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Long wait but very worth while! My date and I had a drink and were able to order before we sat down so the 45 minute wait flew by. Best deep dish I've ever had hands down. It was hard to eat with a knife and our hands but that's half the fun! It was very lively and the staff were attentive to us. We had the Lou and a bruschetta for an appetizer. everything was cooked perfectly and it wasn't crazy loud inside. Would recommend to anyone who is passing through or staying in Chicago!
