Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ask anyone where you should grab the best deep dish and 8/10 will say Lou Malnati's. We keep calling it Illuminati's. We had a long flight and drive into the city so we were experiencing a serious case of hanger. We wasted no time ordering the pepperoni deep dish, and some garlic bread to hold us over (deep dish takes 30 minutes so don't be like me and wait until you're starving). Everything was delicious! There are several locations around the city, but some are take out only, so make sure you check ahead of time if you plan on dining in.
