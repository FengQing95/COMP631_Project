Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Excellent tapas and paella. We had a group of seven on New Year's Day, several of whom have been to Spain. We were all very impressed. Great food. Great service. We sampled probably half the tapas, all the pintxos, and the seafood paella. Everything was delicious! Octopus, lamb, meatballs, wrapped dates were notable. The paella was perfect. Dessert tapas were great fun, a little sweet bite for everyone. Blood orange sangria and terrific sourdough bread rounded out our meal. Go hungry and explore.
