Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was so excited about trying the deep dish at this place and waited an hour to get my fix. After having not so great deep dish elsewhere, I'd figure I'd go to one of the best in the city. Well, after trying this place also, I can't say I'm a big fan of deep dish. The crust was not my cup of tea. Toppings were limited to sausage and pepperoni so vegetarians only have the option of eating plain cheese pizza. Mushrooms? Peppers? Onions?
