Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food here was spectacular, as was the atmosphere and service.  We ordered one of each of the pintxos.  They were all good, but the chorizo wrapped dates were amazing.  You could probably make a meal of them alone.  My wife ordered a few tapas (salmon, meatballs and stuffed mushrooms) and I got the paella de mariscos.  The meatballs were some of the best I've ever tasted, as was the shrimp in the paella.  The black raspberry sangria was delicious, if a little sweet.  The bitter orange beauty was a great twist on an old fashioned.  Since it was our anniversary (which we let them know when making the reservation) they gave us a free deserts (chocolate truffle cake and butterscotch custard) which were delicious.  Overall, this was a great experience.  Anyone who likes Spanish food should check this place out.
