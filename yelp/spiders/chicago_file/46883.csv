Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food, in general was overpriced and super small portions, even for tapas. Â Again, you get more for your money and less attitude at any of the three tapas restaurants I first mentioned above. (and yes, I know Emilio's started off at Cafe BaBaReeba - thank goodness he left and opened his own place!)
