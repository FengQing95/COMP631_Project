Art Institute of Chicago////I have to say I'm a sucker for nostalgic 80's movies. I talked my friend into experiencing a few sights in Chicago from the movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off. The Art Institute was a must see on the list. First off, the museum is huge with an extensive moving exhibit, at the time it was Matisse and an impressive permanent collection too. We saw American Gothic and A Sunday in the Park. We also saw numerous works from Picasso, Salvador Dali, and Monet. An unlikely exhibit we enjoyed was Â the Thorne Miniature's. Mrs James Thorne, married to the heir to Montgomery Ward, collected 68 miniature interiors from 1 inch to one foot tall. It tripped me out how authentic the interiors were. It was as if you were actually peeking into an original home from that era, amazing!
