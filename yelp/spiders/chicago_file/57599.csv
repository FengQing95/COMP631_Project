Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Food is good. Loved paella mixta! So delicious! The atmosphere wasn't anything exciting but the staff was professional and attentive. The paella is what would keep me coming back again and again! Unfortunately I was very disappointed with the spicy potatoes; everybody raves how good they are but I was unimpressed. The potatoes seemed hard and flavorless. The aioli was ok.
