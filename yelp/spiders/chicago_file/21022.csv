Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Wow... this pizza is what dreams are made of! I was excited to try true Chicago deep dish, and even though plenty of other places in town claim to have it, Lou Malnati's was really special. Walked in on a Saturday and it was crowded, so we waited for a table. You're able to place an order while you wait for your table, which is brilliant because it does take a while for their pizza (forty or so minutes). As it was just my fiancé and I, we snagged a bar table instead of waiting for our reservation. Our waiter was so nice and brought our beer quickly while we waited for the pizza to cook. My fiancé's silverware was dirty and he immediately brought a new knife and fork; really attentive and personable! The pizza was amazing; we ordered a small pepperoni deep dish, and it was the perfect size for two. The cheese is on the bottom with very flavorful tomatoes on top, and their Buttercrust is divine. I've heard some people find it "too cheesy," but those words aren't in my vocabulary so I'm not sure how to respond. The pizza was also super reasonable, making it an excellent lunch before walking around the city to burn a few calories off. Lou Malnati's will be my go-to for deep dish and I'm looking forward to a return visit!
