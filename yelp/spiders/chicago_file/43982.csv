Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food here is very tasty. I came here on a double date. For food we had the bacon wrapped dates and they were probably the entire table's favorite. We next did the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce which was paired with garlic bread- no complaints there! The short rib was very tasty and cooked tenderly-we all loved this one too. We all also enjoyed the shrimp with garlic. I really liked the calamari since it was really crispy. Â The chicken empanada was also very flavorful and we all liked that more so than the beef one. We finished with the meatballs which were nothing special and not worth it with so many other delicious items on the menu! The portions were small but it was sufficient for 4 of us to taste everything and still leave stuffed. I had a virgin sangria which I thought was very good and I couldn't tell the difference. The boys felt the drinks were a little too fruity since sangria is pretty much the only option here. The other downside was that the food came out super fast and our meal went very quickly so take your time with ordering if you want to relax and spend time with your friends/family. One tip we would give to this tapas restaurant is to provide serving spoons for the dishes. We were luckily seated next to the food service area and could grab spoons as we pleased but it really is a necessity when you are sharing plates.
