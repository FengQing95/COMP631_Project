Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm very critical when it comes to food, including pizza as I eat out a lot. After a disappointing pizza experience at Giordanos last week, I tried to keep my expectations low though my local friends said I had to try Malnati's before giving up on pizza in Chicago. I ordered the Chicago Malnati classic. Every bite was absolutely delicious, possibly the best deep dish pizza I've had in life. The buttery crust just melts in your mouth. Â The sausages are just right, delicious as well!
