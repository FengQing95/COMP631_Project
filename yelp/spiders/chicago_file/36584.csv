Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The place was pretty crowded at dinnertime on Sunday, but there were a few open seats at the bar. Â I overheard the hostess tell a party with reservations that they were waiting for another party to clear out, so if you're going with more than 2 people, be sure to plan ahead.
