Little Goat Diner////I was able to snag a table here for brunch on Friday. Be early, the place fills up fast! I love the way it's decorated on the inside, super bright interior, modern and eclectic. The food was delicious. We got the reuben, okonomiyaki (sorry if I spelled that incorrectly), hash browns and the bulls eye french toast. The reuben was to die for! The meat was so tender, flavorful and delicious. Cheese, sauerkraut and kimchi, I mean it couldn't have tasted better. The okonomiyaki was a showstopper. It not only looked amazing but tasted amazing as well. It was soft and fluffy with crunchy tempura bites. That mayo and sweet sauce on top was the perfect complement. I loved how thin the hash browns were, they were so crispy and the cheese hidden inside was delicious. My boyfriend really enjoyed his french toast as well. Looking forward to coming back!
