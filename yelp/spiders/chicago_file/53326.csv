Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Pinxto platter:  The ahi tuna on a crostini with avocado was tasty but not mind blowing.  The cheese and quince is fine.  The chorizo wrapped date tasted like fried salami or pepperoni, the boys loved it haha.  The goat cheese croquette was ok and so was the mushroom ball thingy (I can't remember what it was called).  My favorite, however, was the short rib stuffed pepper on crostini.  Soooo good.  Next time, I'll order one for everyone.  They know they're short ribs, as you'll see below.
