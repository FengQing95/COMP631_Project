Little Goat Diner////The adjacent bakery (Little Goat Bread) makes gluten free muffins and are about to start baking gluten free bread!!!!  I was sooooo excited that I couldn't shut up talking about how gluten free is awesome, blah blah, the girl behind the register must've thought i was nutzo.  :) Anyways, the staff is amazing.  We met the manager of the restaurant, James, super nice chap, would love to chat with him again about all the adventures of the Boka Group and Stephanie.  The staff in general are very very nice and super helpful in advising on the menu because it's sort of large and overwhelming.
