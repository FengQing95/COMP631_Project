Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My first experience of Chicago deep dish pizza was way over hyped, so unfortunately, I was underwhelmed with my pizza. I got the classic (cheese, sausage, and tomato) with the butter crust, personal size. It wasn't bad... But it just wasn't as amazing as everyone had promised it would be.
