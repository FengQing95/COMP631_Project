Smoque BBQ////1/2 brisket sandwich with fresh cut fries. Sliced brisket melts in your mouth. Spice it up with candied jalapeños and spicy Memphis sauce. Tried the baked beans a little too smoky for my taste.. Husband says the macaroni and cheese was excellent he would share.  Excellent food overall.
