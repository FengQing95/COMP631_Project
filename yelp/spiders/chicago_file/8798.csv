Art Institute of Chicago////Having a membership alleviates the guilt in trying to see everything.  Just a few days ago, I had an hour to kill between meeting friends for lunch and a Yelp event, so I dropped in and saw the poetry/art collection.  I was able to even memorize part of Frank O'Hara's "Skins" poem as I fell in love with it.  But that's depth you only can do when you only focus on one thing.  And that I feel can only come with membership and stopping by whenever you get time.  It beats my previous outings during the "Free admission times," where I only glanced at multitude of paintings but barely made any registration in my mind.
