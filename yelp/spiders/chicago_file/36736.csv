Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Maude's Seafood Tower - three tiers of oceanic greatness. Between my friend and I, we both agreed that this was some of the best raw seafood we have eaten in Chicago. The pieces were extremely fresh and generous in size. The tower consisted of three tiers of east and west coast oysters, crab legs, lobster tails, shrimp, and salmon ceviche along with a variety of dipping sauces. This tower was definitely a highlight of the meal.
