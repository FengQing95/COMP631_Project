Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I made sure to make dinner reservations here while my bf and I were visiting Chicago. The only availability they had for the day we wanted to come in was at 8:45, which is a pretty late dinner but I also didn't want to pass up the chance dinning here. When we arrived a few minutes before, we were seated right away.
