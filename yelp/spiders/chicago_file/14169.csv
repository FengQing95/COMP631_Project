Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Their crust is so crispy and the butter they put on it puts it over the top, besides the fact of how it amazes me that is holds up with the massive deep dish that sits on top it.  I love the sauce, I love everything about this pizza.  It's the perfect pizza, it is probably a good thing I don't live near one because I would be on a first name basis with the staff if I did...
