Art Institute of Chicago////Yep, the Art Institute is still the #1 Thing to Do in Chicago per Trip Advisor.  And it's not surprising once you're reminded of what all is here.  However, I must say I haven't been here in so long that I can't even remember the last time.  It's a classic example of forgetting the treasures in your own backyard, but I made up a bit of lost time today.  I recently saw the non-member senior admission was only $16 and that sealed the deal for a visit.  For some reason I thought I recalled seeing (rightly or wrongly) an admission fee in the area of $35 and I thought that was kinda steep for an uncultured person, so I put a visit further down the list.
