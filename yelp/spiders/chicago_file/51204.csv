Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food, service and environment was good, but since I have mostly eaten Spanish food in Spain, some of the food seemed Americanized, and not necessarily worth the price.  The fried chicken with piri piri sauce tasted like boneless buffalo wings and the goat cheese with tomato sauce ended up seeming like a glorified French bread pizza in the end with garlic bread as the base.  But the octopus and patatas bravas and pinxtos tasted delicious.
