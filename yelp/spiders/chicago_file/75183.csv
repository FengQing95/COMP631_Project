Little Goat Diner////While waiting I wandered to the bakery that's attached to the restaurant to get a coffee.  Their coffee is DELICIOUS!!!  It's roasted by Dark Matter Coffee so says their 'cup condom'.  Terrific stuff... good for dusting cob webs from your head, warming you ever so nicely and will probably take paint off walls.  The good stuff!!!!
