Little Goat Diner////I have been here twice. For both time, the decisions were made by friends. I would never go by myself after the horrible girl and goat experience. The first time was totally a disaster as girl and goat. The second time, it gained some redemption for its thai flavored pasta. Their coffee in the bakery shop was a disaster again. They have great equipment and beans. My husband is a serious coffee drinker and he literally spitted out Â after first taste. (He usually doesn't do that to bad coffee for the respect of barista. But this time he said he could not stand it at all). Gosh. Sometimes people like and go to a place just because it is popular and trendy.
