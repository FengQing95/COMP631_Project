Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband and I went to dinner at Bavette's after finding it on Yelp. It was the best dinner experience we've ever had. We ordered the tuna tartar which was great. Probably not needed with all the other food we ordered! My husband had the dry aged steak and raved about it. He's hard to impress when it comes to steaks! I had the petite filet and we ordered the bacon and creamed spinach. The bacon was by far my favorite item we ordered. The slices are thick, peppery and sweet with a hint of maple. The creamed spinach was made with cartelized onions and bleu cheese which gave it a uniqueness. I love creamed spinach and this was really high on my list. Service was great! Host staff was exceptionally friendly. We're not fans of super trendy places and we were a little worried at first when we walked in. However, after standing in the entryway we were taken to the dining room. The atmosphere was great! Overall, a great experience!!!
