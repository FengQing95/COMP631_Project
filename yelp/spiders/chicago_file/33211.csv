Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////5) Elote-style Corn: This dish reminded me of a Philipino style corn and also seemed a bit out of place given the overall vibe of the menu. The corn was roasted and was in a thick, orange sauce (mayo or yogurt) and served with a fresh lime to squeeze on top. It was incredibly flavorful and I enjoyed it as a side to the chicken. The dish was good, but not one of my favorites, so I would probably pass on this the next time around.
