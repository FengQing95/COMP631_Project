Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////To be fair to this rating: First, our server was excellent. Second, of our family of four, three of us after having the signature deep dish with butter crust decided we don't really get the fanaticism about Chicago deep dish. It's okay, but much prefer traditional crust or thin crust--and unfortunately did not try either of those.
