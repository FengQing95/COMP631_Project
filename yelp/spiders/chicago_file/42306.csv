Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The cheese plate was a joke with all the items carelessly thrown on a plate and sweaty cheese. Yuck. The roasted dates were awful and totally bland. The patatas bravas were really good and it was the only thing that really pleased me. They tasted just like I remember them from Southern Spain.
