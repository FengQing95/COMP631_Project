Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This was my first tapas experience and I loved it! To start they have multiple flavors of sangria which so far I have had peach and I think the classic red one and both were amazing and for a pitcher very reasonably priced. The server was so nice and helpful since I had no idea what to do and everything we got was delicious-my favorite was the short ribs!
