Smoque BBQ////We ordered the baby back ribs with beans and mac and cheese and the taste portion of sausage. The rib portion was generous and came with plenty of BBQ sauce to cover them with. They were smoky and the rub was tasty. The beans were also smoky with lots of onions and the mac and cheese was creamy and covered with bread crumbs that gave it a nice texture. Absolutely loved the sausage; we plan to order more next time. I ordered carry out on a Friday and was told there was a 1 1/2 hour wait for pick up, which was fine. However, the woman who took the phone order told me about the wait as if she was hoping I would change my mind and not place an order. She was very rude and short with me when I asked her a question. But I would risk the rudeness again because the food was fantastic.
