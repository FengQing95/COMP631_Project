Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I have a metaphoric and obvious boner for a few things: victorian-industrial spaces, steel, parlors, vests. I am -that- person and even though I should probably apologize for being so annoying, I can't. So it's pretty reasonable that my reviews for Sodikoff-operated restaurants are always the most obnoxiously long and usually borderline rabid with fandom (which is funny, because I am generally not a fan of people), and this is obviously not going to be an exception. Except this time, unlike Au Cheval in February, other people clearly know it is open.
