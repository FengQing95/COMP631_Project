Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I visited this wonderful establishment back in February of 2012. I had never been to Chicago so the cold was unlike anything I ever felt. That said I couldn't wait to find a place to warm me up and fill my stomach. My wife and I only had a few hours before our plane departed so we had to find something in close proximity to where we were standing at the time.
