Art Institute of Chicago////What can one say that hasn't already been said? An incredible museum. In this native New Yorker's humble opinion, while smaller in size than the MET, the Art Institute packs just as much of a punch. Not a 1 day museum. In particular, I love the space devoted to the Impressionists - a great collection of Van Gogh, Gauguin, and Monet paintings, among others. The modern art wing is wonderful too.
