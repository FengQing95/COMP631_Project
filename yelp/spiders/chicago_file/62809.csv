Smoque BBQ////I heard of this place on Diners, Drive in and Dives! on The Food Network. Cornbread was dry, Mac and Cheese-awesome! St Louis Ribs were the best I ever had! Coleslaw was average! I'm not a fan of vinegar type BBQ sauces so I'll leave the evaluation of the sauce to a vinegar based enthusiast. I'd go back and will recommend it to friends!
