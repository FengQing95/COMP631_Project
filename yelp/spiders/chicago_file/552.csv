Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////We went on a cold Sunday morning. We parked easily and the hubs went inside to put our names on the list. They quoted us 20 minutes but my husband said it might take us a while because my daughter was sleeping in the car and who knows when she would wake up. But the nice hostess said "come in whenever you're ready and we'll hold your spot in line."  THANK YOU. That was worth the 4 stars!!  What great customer service. Maybe she was a mom too who understood that you don't wake a sleeping baby.
