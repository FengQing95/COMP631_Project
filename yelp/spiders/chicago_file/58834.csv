Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Some of our favorites include the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese baker in tomato sauce. We tried a few items for the first time. We really loved the beef tenderloin with blue cheese, which was perfectly cooked medium rare. The meatballs with tomato sherry sauce were good, just a little heavy due to all the cheese melted on top. The spinach and Manchego stuffed mushrooms were excellent and we loved the lemony sauce it came with!
