Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So if you wanna know Chicago pizza from a life long Chicagoan, don't go to Lou's. Its my least favorite pizza, deep dish and thin crust. Not a fan of their pizza dough and their menu in general. Its touristy at certain locations and their wait times are long for deep dish that isn't worth the wait. Go to Uno's or Gino's or Giordanos or Chicago's. These places know how to make really good deep dish pizza.
