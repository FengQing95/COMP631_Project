Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My first experience with Chicago Style Deep Dish pizza began years ago at Lou Malnati's. Upon trying this place a second time, I left satisfied and (only slightly) underwhelmed. They undoubtedly serve a solid deep dish pizza and their service is good. Based on high expectations and tough nearby competition, this place is A-OK. Three stars for Lou Malnati's.
