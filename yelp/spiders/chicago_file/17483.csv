Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you've been around the block when it comes to Chicago deep dish, I'm sure you have strong feelings about where it's best. But this newbie couldn't get over the butter crust, surprisingly sweet tomato sauce, and tender Italian sausage. My boyfriend (who introduced me to Lou Malnati's...yes, we're pretty open about these kind of things) & I enjoyed some cold 312s while we waited for our pie, reclining in the leather armchairs at our table. The chairs made it a little hard to eat our pizza - I leaned forward a lot - but were lovely to relax in before the food came, and after the server departed with our empty pie tin.
