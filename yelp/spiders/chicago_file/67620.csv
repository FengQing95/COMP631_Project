Little Goat Diner////Came with an appetite so I got what seemed to be the most ridiculous burger on the menu. The Goat Almighty. Properly named and properly delicious. Couldn't finish it all but tasted great reheated a day later. I usually get desert but couldn't get the one breakfast item I actually wanted at 7pm (cinnamon bun) so settled for apple pie instead. Nom nom.
