Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I had heard great things about this place and happened to end up there for dinner during happy hour on my first visit. The happy hour menu was an incredible deal - each small plate was only $2-3 and we got a pitcher of sangria for $16. All of the tapas were great with the bacon wrapped dates, ham and chicken croquettes, meatballs, and beef empanada most notable. They also have pretty decent bread and olive oil at the table as well which is a nice touch.
