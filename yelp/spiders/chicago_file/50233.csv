Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The restaurant even smells like Spain. You can't get much more authentic than that. I was instantly transported to Spring Break 2003 in Toledo. I half expected to see the chefs preparing my paella while smoking cigarettes with hanging butts on the verge of falling into my meal. Most Americans might consider that unclean, but I say it adds an additional smokey flavor to the cured meats.
