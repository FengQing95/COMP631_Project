Art Institute of Chicago////I love Art but find big museums like this one are less interested in giving you a good experience than getting into your wallet.  It is not surprising that more people avoid art museums when you see all of the road-blocks.  Will I continue to visit these big museums? Yes, but am making more of an effort to search out the smaller intimate museums that care more about the art than the money.
