Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great fun and fantastic tapas! Went in Christmas Eve and expected light crowd and indifferent service but it was 180 degrees from my assumption! The atmosphere was warm and festive and the staff could not have been more attentive. Our party ordered 8 tapas and 2 paella's. Plenty of food for all. Each tapas was more flavorful than the next. Paella was a bit dry bust so tasty. Bacon wrapped figs were a killer, as was the blood orange salad. Shrimp was heavy on garlic but plump and delicious. Cannot wait to return.
