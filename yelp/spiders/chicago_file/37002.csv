Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food is utterly delicious. In all honestly, I only tried this restaurant because we went for a company dinner. The prices were much more enticing when it was on the firm and not me, but after having eaten here, I know I will be going back when I want to drop some money on a nice dinner.
