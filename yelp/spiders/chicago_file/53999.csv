Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Very good! Service was a little slow even with a reservation for 2 but we enjoyed it. Bloody Mary bar was my favorite! Everything comes in small plates which is fun to try things. I remember the food was good, nothing super spectacular, it was mainly all about the bloodies for me.
