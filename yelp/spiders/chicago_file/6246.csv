The Purple Pig////We celebrated our anniversary in Chicago and one of our favorite spots was the Purple Pig. We were sad that it was just the two of us, because we wanted to order one of everything on the menu, but that would turn us into the purple pigs, so we went with a few favorites. The wait was minimal, and gave us a chance to sample some cheese and wine before we dined.
