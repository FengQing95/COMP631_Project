Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was one of the best things I tasted while I was in Chicago.  The salad was an awesome bland of sweet with savory and just went well with the pizza.  From Lou Malnati's site, the salad is comprised of, "romaine lettuce, diced tomatoes, black olives, sliced mushrooms, crumbled Volpi salami and gorgonzola cheese. Tossed with Lou's famous dressing with a touch of romano cheese." A great blend of ingredients.
