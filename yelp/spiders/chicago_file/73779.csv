Little Goat Diner////Came here for an early weeknight dinner and didn't have to wait long for a table of two.  I ordered the pork torta which was juicy and had a nice citrus kick.  It also was gigantic, could've served two.  My friend had the pot pie which was delicious and homey.  We were both too full for dessert.  I was recently informed they have little tartlets/pies at the in house bakery which I will definitely try next time!
