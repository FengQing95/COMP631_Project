Art Institute of Chicago////If you're short on time, just pick up the map brochure with the "greatest hits" on the back page, and go through it in about an hour.  Conversely, you could spend an entire day wandering through all the galleries overdosing on great art and still not see the entire collection.  With our membership, I've visited a couple times every month for a year now, and still not sure I've seen everything.
