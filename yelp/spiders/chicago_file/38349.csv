Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////During our meal, Brandon was always checking on us and making sure were enjoying our food and otherwise taken care of. Drinks were refilled.  Everything was just great.  Brandon ended up comping the dessert for us in celebration, which was a fantastic touch to make us feel special.  Again, this was truly a 5-star dining experience and we can't wait to go back!
