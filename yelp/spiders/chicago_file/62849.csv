Smoque BBQ////Meat and sauce are the keys; everything else is ancillary.  I give an overall A for the two basic elements of barbecue.  Smoque offers two sauces with your meal, and I LOVED the thicker one.  It is very smoky and a bit spicy, unlike my usual favorite barbecue sauces.  The thinner, vinegary sauce was okay but not for me.
