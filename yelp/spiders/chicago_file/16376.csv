Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place was good. The pizza was not anything exceptional. But for a late night meal it serves he purpose. Our server was young, uninformed and seemed uninterested. Other than that I've had better pizza at places like Bacino's on Wacker Dr. (which I think is closed) but not far from here.
