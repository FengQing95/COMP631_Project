Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went there on a Sunday for dinner and couldn't be more pleased! Everyone we interacted with, especially our waiter, was amazing. The ambiance and crowd is awesome too. We ordered the shrimp, goat cheese, chicken & chorizo skewer, and olives and honestly, I couldn't find something to critique if I tried. Also ordered a Â 1/2 pitcher of peach sangria which I highly recommend. Our waiter so elegantly talked us into dessert, so we ordered the butterscotch and truffle, which was TERRIFIC. This is such a fun place to go either on a date or with family. Will be going back!
