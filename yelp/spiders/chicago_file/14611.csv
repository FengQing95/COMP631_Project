Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The waitress came back around again and I asked her to speak with the manager again, to which she responded, "Oh, is there something wrong with the check?" to which I replied, "Yes. The fact that there is one." She looked confused and ran off to grab the same unhelpful manager from earlier, who also appeared confused as to what additional problems there could be. Was it really that surprising? Really?!?!?
