Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Fast forward a few years and I hadn't been in a while and recently went with my wife.  We were looking forward to it because we both loved this place.  We got there and ordered some of everything, our old favorites and some new stuff.  We got all of the pintxos, not impressed at all.  They changed the recipe for a lot of their dishes in the 4 months since we'd been there last.  Some of the hot food was cold.  The food that should be cold was luke warm like it had been sitting out.  Our waiter came by so infrequently that we decided to order everything all at once because there was not telling when he would come back.  Our drink orders were messed up, we got food that we didn't order and we didn't get food that we did order, all the way through dessert.  We ordered three desserts and only got one thing that we ordered.  The seafood paella was so bland I wanted to cry.  The socarrat on the bottom of the pan was non-existent.  It felt like meeting an ex-lover that you longed for only to find that while your love for her grew she only grew disdain.  I couldn't rationalize the complete change.  I started feeling bad, wondering if people I recommended this place to had the same experience as me.  If anyone came here under my recommendation and had this happen to them I apologize.  What made it worse was that it was my wife's birthday, smh, so you know I had to make up for it.
