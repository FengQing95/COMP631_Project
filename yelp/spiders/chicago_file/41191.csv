Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Had dinner with a local and an out of towner. Always busy so make reservations but once you sit down prepare for some fun. Drinks, especially house sangria's are great and refreshing. Food is strong and a good showing of the Spanish culture. Great for conversation and a non rushed experience.
