Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of my favorite restaurants while living in Chicago. The goat cheese baked in tomato sauce is probably the best goat cheese based dish I've ever had anywhere. This dish alone is worth coming here. I usually go with friends on a Friday or Saturday night, which is usually packed so reservations ahead of time is a must on those nights. The atmosphere is very lively and the food and drinks are amazing. I always order the sangria and the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce. I've tried a variety of other dishes such as the grilled octopus, bacon wrapped dates and empanadas and never been disappointed. Great place to bring guests from out of town!
