Smoque BBQ////Smoque is the real deal. You cannot go wrong. Especially if you order the brisket. Seriously. That brisket is the best. You will not have a better brisket! Pulled pork pretty awesome, too! Fries, slaw, chili, cornbread are all on point. I don't even mess with anything else because those items are so good! Try all the sauce. I like to mix the Carolina and the Memphis together. Lines can be long, especially in good weather. Worth the wait. You aren't here for the atmosphere or the speed, you are here for some damn good food! They do have a small parking lot in back, you may get lucky with a spot. Otherwise, you might need to drive around a little for a spot because it's on a residential street and a main road. But whatever. Just go!
