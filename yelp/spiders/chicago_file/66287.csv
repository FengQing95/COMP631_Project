Little Goat Diner////When we got a table in the dining room, disappointment began to set in.  Our server, Rebecca, was great!  She knew exactly what she was talking about, and answered all of our questions completely!  Unfortunately, where we ran into some strange issues, was with some woman who seemed to be a manager.  She kept coming up to our table and asking if everything was ok, and when we had asked about a full description of our sandwich, she gave us a reply that simply didn't set well with us.  Her demeanor was very "high and mighty" and it felt like every question we asked, we ended up feeling like idiots for asking, because she made us feel that way.  Unfortunately I do not remember her name, but I know that it was definitely unique, and not a common name.  Perhaps, Keisha?
