Little Goat Diner////All in all, this place is pretty good! At first glance everything on the menu seems pretty simple and synonymous with a diner however when it came out it was way beyond any traditional diner fare. The staff was really friendly and prompt and our waitress was very accommodating of a food allergy one of us has (they have a huge gluten-free menu) and gave us plenty of time to read the menu. This place is great if you're looking for some comfort food with class. I'll definitely go back however next time I'll try something that'll fill me up.
