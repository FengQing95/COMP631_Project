Little Goat Diner////Three of my friends had dinner here last night and we were all quite excited for our dinner at Little Goat as none of us had been there but had heard great reviews. We arrive and the evening started well. The waitress (can't remember her name but she had a skull tattoo on her right wrist) seemed nice and attentive and our drinks arrived promptly. I usually log on to YELP to check out reviews before I go to new restaurants but again as I stated, I had already heard rave reviews.
