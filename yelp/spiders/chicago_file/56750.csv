Smoque BBQ////We tried to go there on Saturday at 7pm and saw a sign on the door that said "Sorry we are out of everything".  Thinking this was a joke we went in to find out they only had sides left and a rack of ribs....guess everything should not be taken literally.  We left disappointed and tried again on Sunday.  We got there at 1pm, 2 hours after they opened, and the line was out the door and they were already out of pulled pork and St. Louis style ribs.  After waiting in line and finishing our meal we walked out the door to see them put up another..."Sorry we are out of everything sign".  Keep in mind this was 3 hours after they opened!!!
