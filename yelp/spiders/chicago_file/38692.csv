Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Prime Bone In Dry Aged Ribeye - this was named as one of Chicago's best steaks and it's very good.  Cooked perfectly medium rare and served only with some steak salt and bernaise sauce for dipping, it's the classic preparation.  Really can't complain though I've had steaks that are even more tender.
