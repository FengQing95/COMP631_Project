Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Best deep dish ever!! I've tried Lou malnatis as well as giordanos and Lou's pizza definitely stood out on top. My friends and I ordered the sampler, the cheesy spinach bread and two small deep dish pizzas! There was more than enough food for the 5 of us. But left overs are even better! The pizzas took a little while to come out, but it's expected since it is a Chicago styled deep dish pizza. We got the classic as well as Lou and both were so good! Just the right amount of cheese and the crust was awesome!
