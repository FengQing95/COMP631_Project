Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Loved the food but had absolutely the worst service ever! Our waters didn't get refilled once. He never asked how the food was, he was no where to be found when we wanted to order more or when were finished and sat for over 30 minutes waiting to see him to ask for our check. Once we got our check it took another 15 minutes for him to pick up the credit card that was standing in the check presenter on the edge of the table. Â The only reason he came over when he did was when another server noticed my boyfriend standing and putting on his jacket and brought it to the attention of our server who was standing with his back to us at the open kitchen counter area.
