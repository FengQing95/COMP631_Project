Art Institute of Chicago////Some of the security guards are helpful and friendly. Most just look bored. It is amazing that you have to tell people to not touch the exhibits. When asked where something was, they would help. Personally, I think they ought to be more assertive with the more popular exhibits in moving folk along so everyone has an opportunity to enjoy them.
