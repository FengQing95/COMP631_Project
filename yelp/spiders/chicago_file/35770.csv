Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I ordered the petite 6 oz filet and my fianc√© had to 10 oz filet. There is no chance that there was a 4 oz difference between them. They came out almost too quickly - within 15 mins of ordering. Also, my filet was not cooked evenly. I requested that my filet was prepared medium, although most of it was medium-well.
