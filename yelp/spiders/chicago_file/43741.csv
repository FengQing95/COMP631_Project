Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Over my several visits I've tried the majority of items on the menu and the bacon wrapped dates are to die for.  We typically end up ordering at least 2 rounds of them.  Also some favorite dishes are the scallops,  patatas bravas (these have a fabulous kick to them) and the ahi tuna tatar.
