Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Food - we had a seafood tower as an appetizer. Lobster, shrimp, and oysters. All fantastic. We had crab stuffed avocado...YUM. Sides - pommes frites and creamed spinach and thick cut bacon. Again, YUM. My friend and I both had the petite filet. My husband had the dry aged bone in rib eye. My friend's husband had the Pork Chop. All good was fantastic. I'm not sure I would change a thing.
