Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our server was great, though the pizza did take much longer than we thought since we placed the order so early. The classic was tasty, this was my favorite deep dish of the trip. It's not as deep and the crust is thin and crunchy. For 2 people, it was not overly heavy at all, and the perfect size for us.
