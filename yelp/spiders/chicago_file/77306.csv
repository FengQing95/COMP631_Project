Little Goat Diner////When I arrived at 12:03, the place was clearly bustling and had an hour and 25min wait. Definitely expecting to wait until at least the reservation, I began to grow crotchety when the clock ticked to past 12:25 and we had not yet been sat. We finally received our table by 12:30 but proceeded to wait for a server to come to our table until almost 12:40. Luckily, my dining partner and I already knew exactly what we planned to eat and drink, so we ordered it all in one shot (pre-research is a crucial tactic).
