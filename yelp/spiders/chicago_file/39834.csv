Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Hands down my favorite steakhouse in Chicago. The feel inside takes you back to another time. Oh and the food well it's worth every penny. Went with the 42 day aged Ribeye amazing flavor and to be honest I would have just ate the mushrooms for a meal as they were so delicious. True Chicago classic!
