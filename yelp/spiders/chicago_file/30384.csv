Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I headed over to the location on Wells around 11:30am on a Saturday. It wasn't packed but it seemed like a tour group was heading in there around the same time. I ended up sitting at the bar since it was convenient and they have full service there as well. Didn't get any drinks besides water and chose the Malnati's special (personal size).
