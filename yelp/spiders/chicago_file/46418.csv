Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went here for my birthday with my parents. One of the best tapas restaurants ive been to! The blackberry sangria is amazing. All of the food here is really high quality. This place is HUGE on the inside. You should always split the seafood paella when you come here, the monkfish makes it! Nearly everything is great here excluding the curry chicken salad. It tastes like the same grocery store packaged salad. Very bland tasting. All in all the food and atmosphere here is great though!
