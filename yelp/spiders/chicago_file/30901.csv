Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My friend and I came here to watch the world cup and sat at the bar. This is random, but I have a thing for people-watching and I'd give a shout-out to the staff at this place. Everyone here is really nice not only to the customers, but I noticed the way they interacted with each other and they were really cute and seemed like one big family, which made me happy.
