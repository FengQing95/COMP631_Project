Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Listen, i understand if you are busy but at least pretend like you are, she never moved quick, she was extremely rude and the WORST service I've ever had in my life! The pizza was not that great, tasted like it had been under a heat lamp for a while. And the food in general was over shadowed by her horrible service. On a side note I saw the manager walking around (guy in his early 40s maybe) but couldn't find him after the service took a turn for the horrible. Or I would've said something to him.
