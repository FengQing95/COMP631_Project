Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So far this place has not been worth the two hour wait!!! The staff greets you as if they are doing you a favor to check you in or for you to even be in their presence. They were rude to every customer and should understand that most people visiting don't understand the process. I will continue my review once I get my pizza that I have been waiting 2 hours for. This has been the worse service I have received in a restaurant. Don't waste your money or time coming here!
