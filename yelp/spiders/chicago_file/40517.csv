Bavette's Bar & Boeuf//// Main courses were lamb chop for me and ribeye for hubby only two chop but meaty and so well seasoned I haven't has red meat in a way so this was a treat! My man is the pickiest on the planet and he loved his food yayyy. Rich D  Actually read our  Profile prior to our reservation and knew that we did not want shellfish or pork  so he made sure that that was still the case we didn't want any  prepared near our meal.  All the sides are served allocart so his cart so we had mushrooms ,  sweet potato and the truffle Mac and cheese I was very scared to try the truffle Mac and cheese cause I've had tried truffle dish before and it can be very overpowering but this dish was so decadent and creamy and it's definitely different but delicious The little things really made the difference here to make it a is a personalized and memorable meal . The complimentary champagne and signature carrot cake elevated this restaurant to top tier status for me! I love it
