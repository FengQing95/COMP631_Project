Art Institute of Chicago////Admittedly, my husband and I wanted to check this place out simply because Ferris Bueller and his friends had such a good time here.  So, off we went in search of school children on a field trip so we could crash the trip and join their chain of hand holding.  Only now, we discovered thst chain hand holding is not the preferred method of keeping groups of children together.  Instead you get in a single file line, stretch your arms straight out in front of you like Frankenstein and place your hands on the shoulders of the person ahead of you.  This is more effective, but it's somewhat awkward when there are significant height differences, and so my hubby and I broke off on our own as one of the room moms laughed when we ran past the group in our own Frankenstein march.
