Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Service was excellent. Since deep dish takes a little over half an hour to make, I liked that they let you pre-order your pizza while waiting for a table so that by the time you're seated, you're waiting no more than another 10-15 minutes for your pizza. They also text you to let you know when your table is ready which is always nice! The restaurant was very lively with lots of crowds. The basketball game was on, people were flooding the bar, and the restaurant itself had a home family feel to it.
