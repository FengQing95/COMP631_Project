Smoque BBQ////BIGGEST TIP-BRING YOUR OWN BEER! The smell from the door made me even more hungry then I already was! We arrived on a late Friday evening with a large group with the line out the door. We were all seated together in about 30 minutes, this place MOVES!  I had a pulled pork sandwich which turned out to be a group favorite.  I would definitely recommend it !  My only tip for next time is that I would order the fries as a side, I ate quite a few of my friends who ordered them!
