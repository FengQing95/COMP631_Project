The Purple Pig////Be prepared for long waits! My friend and I came here on a Saturday at around 530pm and had to wait about 30 minutes for a table of two. To be perfectly honest, it was a short wait compared to what I've heard from others and larger table (a table of 7 before us was given an estimated time of 2 hours with a minimum $100 spend per person). I put my name and number down and they sent me a text to Â confirm and I was able to walk around shops during the waiting time.
