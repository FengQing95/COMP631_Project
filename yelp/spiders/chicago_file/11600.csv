Art Institute of Chicago////In a sense, I felt unleashed and free like her. In particular, her breasts remind me of how well-rounded this museum is, with each one reflective of the 2 wings here. The MODERN WING has Contemporary Art, Modern American Art (of course), Greek/Roman/Byzantine Art, and downstairs they have an Islamic section (there were only like 2 other people besides us in there - I will blame it on people not wanting to walk downstairs to the LL). The MICHIGAN AVENUE BUILDING includes the highly acclaimed Thorne Miniature Rooms (which I didn't spend too much time in as I didn't wanna be like the guy at Chuck E Cheese's without a kid), prints and drawings, Asian/African/Indian Art, European Art, and Impressionism. I hold to my position that the Modern Wing is more enjoyable than the Michigan side as tightly as her hands cling to her boobs.
