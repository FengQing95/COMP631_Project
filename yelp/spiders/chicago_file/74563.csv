Little Goat Diner////I ordered the Pork Cutlet Sandwich. Yes, sir! The pork was thin and perfectly breaded and fried. It was a divine pork cutlet. It was served on house made white bread. According to the waitress, I should have delighted in the texture difference between the crispy pork and soft white bread. I didn't think the white bread held up well with the hot pork. Just my opinion for what it's worth. That said, I'd order if again. The pork was the bomb.
