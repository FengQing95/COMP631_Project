Smoque BBQ////We were getting ready to head to the airport and decided to get a last bite in the beautiful state of Illinois when we came across this gem. Â Just like any first timer, big menus can be overwhelming. An employee. Carlos was very friendly as soon as we walked in. He greeted us, showed us the menu on the wall and handed my husband a menu when he said he couldnt see it from there. He then asked if he could make suggestion, more places should do this. We ended up getting perfectly seasoned, melt off the bone ribs, cheesy macaroni, meaty chili, delicious coleslaw and a side of brisket and 3 different bbq sauces, all delicious. It's been 3 hours and i can still taste it and i am sad to not be able to eat that again anytime soon. I loved the restaurant, which was very busy yet felt very cozy. Next time we are in town i hope to have a few meals here. Thanks to Carlos again, who checked on us and chatted with us just enough to make us feel like we were regulars.
