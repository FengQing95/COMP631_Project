Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I tried their Lou Malnati's salad, cheesy bread, veggie deep dish and regular deep dish pizza. The salad was normal.., and the pizza was thinner than I expected in that the crust was still pretty tall but the toppings seemed less than other deep dish pizzas. I really enjoy the sausage that they put on the pizza. Absolutely delicious! And the customer service here was amazing.
