Little Goat Diner////We finally got to our table. Another 20 minutes passes and our server finally comes up to us, and said, "whaddayawannadrink." Literally, that's it. I shouldn't be so critical of waitstaff because I know it was super busy that night, and I know she probably had a lot on her plate -- but we didn't even have anything on ours.
