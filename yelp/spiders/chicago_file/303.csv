Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Long wait but solid breakfast food and coffee. Perfect service. We got the fig omelette and the veggie omelette with plain pancakes. The pancakes had hints of vanilla and were nice and fluffy. The veggie omelette was watery and not fully cooked, but the fig was done right. You can get fruit instead of hash browns, which saves u on some grease.
