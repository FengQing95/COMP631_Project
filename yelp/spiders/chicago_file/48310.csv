Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of my favorite places in the city. Excellent food and many choices to keep everyone happy. The wine is good, the sangria is really good. I've only been for brunch once and I'd go back for sure. I would definitely make a reservation if possible as it's always packed. Otherwise you end up waiting or trying snag a bar seat. We can go here without getting the beef skewer with horseradish cream. It's my favorite thing on the menu.
