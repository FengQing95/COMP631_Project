Smoque BBQ////First time eating here. Wow. Everything is delicious. The ambiance is perfect. The hospitality the best! Shout out to Carlos from bringing to our table some honey as a recommendation. That added an extra sweet flavor to my meal. I added a bit to everything! Went crazy. My bbq beans, cornbread, chopped brisket and St. Louis ribs. Thanks Carlos, and thanks to Smoque BBQ for a delicious dinner! We'll be back when we return to Chicago.
