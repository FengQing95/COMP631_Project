Smoque BBQ////Very good BBQ, very good service, great ownership, could use an expansion in restaurant size. Only reason I did not give 5 stars is probably just the size of the place, so SMOQUE really deserves 4.5 stars. I have had pretty much everything off the menu at this point and my favorite so far is the chopped brisket. As for a side, don't miss the Mac'n'Cheese, amazing. Get there early to avoid super long line. Also, BYOB so remember your beer.
