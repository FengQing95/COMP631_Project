Smoque BBQ////I finally tried this place after hearing about it.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a side of bbq beans and cornbread.  The portions they give is just about right.  I have not had the ribs or beef brisket and maybe I will give then more stars after I taste more items on the menu.  I found the pulled pork to be average and the sauce was just ok.  The best part of my meal was the bbq beans.  I am rating this place solely on the meal I had, and I must say Ive tasted many pulled pork sandwiches better than theirs. This place is ok, but I wouldnt go out of my way just to have it.
