Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////A Chicago classic and I don't have any insight into distinguishing features of one deep dish over another . I got the Lou's (the vegetarian one) and it was phenomenal. Cheesy, saucy goodness mixed with a great crunchy crust, I wasn't disappointed. The best part is, deep dish pizza is better next day pizza than normal pizza and the couple slices of Lou's I had left over were a great next day snack. If you are in Chicago, you can't go wrong with a trip to Lou's
