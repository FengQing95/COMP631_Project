Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered ahead for carry-out, knowing the wait would be about 45 minutes. I guess that's the standard for pizza around here? When we got there to pick up the pizza and wings, it was packed! Even though out pizza was already ready, we still had to wait a bit because of all the customers that were in line and waiting.
