Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////When I'm in Chicago, I always pop into Bavette's to get my steak fix. I love the food, the drinks, the staff, and the ambiance-it's a delicious and relaxing meal .. It's a good time. Without reservations, I was able to get a table for two recently in the early evening without trouble; I've had good luck getting a single place at the bar as well. I do recommend making a reservation, though.
