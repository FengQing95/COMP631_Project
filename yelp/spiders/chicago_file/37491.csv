Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I have to say this is the best place - HANDS DOWN - I've ever been too. Some colegues and I are out here for business and wanted to grab some dinner.So glad I came to Chicago. The music is great, the food is outstanding and the service is SUPERB!!!!! You cannot go wrong coming to this place. Ask for Sarah - Best Waitress Ever!!!! And so were the guys helping out. The staff is super nice from when you walk, seated, and walk out. You can't help but leave a huge tip for these folks. If you want superb service all the way around - this place is the spot.
