Smoque BBQ////While we waited in line (it was a long line but moved pretty fast and was a regular wait for a weekend at a Chicago restaurant) we had a chance to speak with the older gentleman (owner's father?) and followed up on the gluten question. He told us to make sure to tell the cashier when ordering food and the kitchen staff would be sure to change gloves and use clean utensils when plating my food. He then walked up to the cashier when we got to the front of the line to ensure I was taken care of.
