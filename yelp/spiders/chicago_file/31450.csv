Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered a personal pizza and the chicken Marsala pasta. I am no deep dish conneissour, but the previous restaurant that I tried deep dish, I was not impressed. So, if I didn't like the pizza here, at least I'd be able to enjoy the pasta. I will say that $10.75 for a personal size pizza is a bit ridiculous as this is football stadium pricing, but that pretty much seems to be the norm. The personal pizza was good, better than the first I had at a competitor, but def not enough for dinner... more like an appetizer or snack. So IMO, even as one person for dinner I'd order a small pizza. The pasta on the other hand was loaded with chicken and mushrooms and super filling! Thankfully the chicken breast was cut up unlike other Marsalas where you're given the full breast.
