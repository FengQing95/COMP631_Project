Little Goat Diner////- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it's not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it'll still taste good.
