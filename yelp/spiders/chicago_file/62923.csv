Smoque BBQ////The service was also amazing. All of the employees seemed happy (not quite Trader Joe level, but close) to be there and the owner was friendly, but not overbearing. We ordered at the counter (with gentle suggestions from the owner) and then were told where to sit. In a few minutes, our food was brought to us. The tables were clean.
