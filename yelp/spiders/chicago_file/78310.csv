Little Goat Diner////The portion sizes are HUGE. If you order a side, it is shareable between 2-3 people, specifically the hash browns and cinnamon rolls! Everything on the menu sounded amazing, I wish I could've ordered one of everything. I ended up ordering "This Little Piggy Went To China" which is asian cuisine inspired. The flavor was incredible...I honestly don't even know how to describe it! My friend ordered the Bull's Eye French Toast and I can say the same as before, so flavorful and delicious that I can't even find words to describe!
