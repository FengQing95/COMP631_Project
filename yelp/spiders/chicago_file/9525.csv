Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute of Chicago is a landmark Chicago spot that features both a nice modern decor and a very large art collection (including many prominent artists like Picasso, Van Gough, Monet, Jackson Pollock and iconic paintings like American Gothic, Nighthawks, The Child's Bath, A Sunday on La Grande Jatte). Â I liked many of the works here, but the incredible detail and vibrant colors of Vincent Van Gough's self-portrait stood out the most.
