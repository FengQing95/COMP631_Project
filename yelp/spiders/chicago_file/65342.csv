Smoque BBQ////I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they're open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It's pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
