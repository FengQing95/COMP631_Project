Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I am in love with this place!  And who isn't?  The food is amazing, the atmosphere is top notch, and the sangria....LAWD!!  Went here recently for my BFF's bachelorette party.  We had a prix fixed deal and it was great.  They kept bringing us more and more food and each dish tasted better than the last.  That potato salad was the best thing ever.  I have never gottenn bad service there.  Everytime I go the service is impeccable.  I went one time and was dancing to the background music (not because I was drinking, but because I can't stand still) and a waiter saw me and started dancing with me!  How cool is that?!  They have a great lunch menu too.  Give them a try.  I promise you'll want to go back!
