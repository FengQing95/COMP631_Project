The Purple Pig////Do not think this place lives to the hype unfortunately as I had tried to go on several occasions. Finally ended up going on a Weds evening around 5 and there was no wait. Â The location is convenient off the magmile and the service is decent but the food had some hit and miss. Portions are small to medium sized and for sharing.
