Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For appetizer, we ordered the roasted bone marrow which included 5 bones for ~$19. The bone marrows were delicious and came with several slices of bread to pair with the delicious beef butter. For the entree, we decided to split a dry aged rib eye cooked to a medium rare for $70. It was my first time trying a dry aged steak and I was definitely not disappointed! The dry aged-ness of the steak makes it taste kind of funky yet the steak has a great amount of flavor in each bite. Overall, really impressed by the taste, and also decided to add some roasted garlic (+$4) to add some more flavor. I wouldn't recommend getting an additional marrow for the steak ($8) because it is only one bone, it's better to just go for the actual marrow platter itself to get more bang for your buck.
