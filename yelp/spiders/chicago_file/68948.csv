Little Goat Diner////The big upside is that the food was delicious, and since we were seated along the far wall we could hear each other talk and had a lovely time visiting.  Also a plus that they offer valet parking which is great for a place on that restaurant strip during the day.  The Banh mi was wonderful with just enough heat, and the Fried Pickle and Onion sandwich was really a layered vegetarian concoction on flat bread -- unusual and very tasty.  So, popular, great food, and enh service.
