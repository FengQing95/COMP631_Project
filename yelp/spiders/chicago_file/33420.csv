Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////BEST STEAK YET.  VERY ROMANTIC ATMOSPHERE. Cool, relaxed vibe, not stuffy at all.  Had a question about the Marrow side. Chef Darren came out to explain how he cooks it. Really nice.  And of equal importance - our Waiter Brandon. Such a warm, kind, professional, efficient person/waiter - Bavette's finest.  Be sure to ask for him - he made the whole evening very special. We thought Brandon and Darren were actors because they were so handsome. They gave us permission to post their pic.
