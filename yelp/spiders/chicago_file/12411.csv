Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute of Chicago ranks right up there with the great art museums of the world. They have a great variety of rotating exhibits, meaning the museum never gets stale. If you think you'll go multiple times in a year, I highly recommend getting a membership - it pays for itself within a couple visits.
