Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visiting Chicago for business and wanted a light meal! Walked in and saw that they had minestrone soup so I popped in and enjoyed the best minestrone soup I've ever had! The broth was so flavorful! Also had the Malnati salad!! Equally as delicious!! I may have to go back and try the pizza!!! Service was also excellent!!
