Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered a pizza for 3-4 people because we figured we hadn't eaten lunch, it was 4pm, and we were two decently hungry dudes. We ended up taking home a third of it, since the pizza was so ridiculously thick. I didn't understand how there could literally be a LAYER of sausage topped by almost half-inch layer of cheese. HALF AN INCH. Ok I didn't exactly measure it but that's what it felt like.
