Little Goat Diner////I was very excited to go to The LGD. There were some creative things on the menu. I had a veggie patty melt. It was mushy and smothered in Velveta with sweet pickles on it. Not very good. The others in our party had wonderful looking dishes, however, and they all said they enjoyed them. Brisket sandwich looked amazing. The smoked fries, tempura mashed potatoes and mac and cheese sides were very, very good. Now, to the real disappointment. Our sides came out first. We then waited another 15 minutes for the first two entrees to come out. And another 10 for the other two entrees to be served (we were a party of four). By the time all of the entrees were served, the sides were cold (it was very, very cold in the restaurant). Our waitress acknowledged that the sides came out before the entree and her response was "well, I guess you have side appetizers". The correct response would have been to put them back in the kitchen and keep them warm until ALL the entrees were ready to be served. Our waitress was very nice, but the service was not at all professional. But....I might try again just to see if it was an "off" day for them.
