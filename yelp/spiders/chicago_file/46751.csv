Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The bread came toasted and they were all very delicious.  I don't normally like olives or eggplant, but those jarras were darn tasty.  My mother loved the third one due to its spice.  My dad devoured the 1st one.  Me? I had oh so sweet relationship with the goat cheese jarra.  It was so good.  The mint and pistachio note sang in the goat cheese and the nipper preserves added a nice sweetness to the whole.  We went through the toasted bread that came with the dish and went through 2 bread baskets.  I have to say they were very attentive and kept an eye on bread and water levels.
