The Purple Pig////all of our friends recommended we try this place. It's on Michigan avenue, kind of tucked away. My first experience with this place was annoyance since they didn't take reservations. We tried to come here at an obscure lunch time as to not have to wait for too long, but surprise! This place is pretty busy most of the time. Ok, Â we put our name in to wait. I will say they specifically have a waitor taking drink orders for the people that are waiting so I really loved that. Waiting wasn't so bad when I had a place to sit and didn't have to keep going to the bar to get drinks. We finally get in.
