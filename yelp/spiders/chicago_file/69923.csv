Little Goat Diner////Bottom Line:  Eh.. Overhyped and Underwhelmed   When the sides are the standout i think you have a problem.  Its definitely nice to have a diner/breakfast spot on restaurant row but it just didnt do it for me.  Specially for the prices.  Oh .. the place is also very family friendly.  Lots of families with their kids in there.
