Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were seated in a room of other tourists, apparently, because the Blackhawks were on every TV and scored a bunch of times and no one said a word..so it was clear we were all out of towners. Even though we had ordered the pizza when we put our name in for the table, it still took kinda a long time. We ordered some calamari to munch on in the mean time. It wasn't very good, tasted like typical bar food calamari and wasn't very hot either. It was serviced with cocktail sauce, as opposed to marinara sauce. We asked for marinara sauce, but it never came. The calamari got even colder so we finally just ate it with the cocktail sauce because our waitress was MIA (we also asked for water that took us a couple of times of reminding her before we got those).
