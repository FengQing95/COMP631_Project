Little Goat Diner////The chili cheese fries are out of this world! The goat chili is very good. The goat flavor is not overwhelming. They did a VERY good job preparing the goat meat. My boyfriend ordered the sloppy goat. Again, very good. It is a mixture of goat meat and beef so the taste is not very strong, but you can definitely taste the goat. It comes on a warm butternut squash roll, which adds some sweetness to the dish. I ordered the los drowned. The beef was tender and probably one of the best beef sandwiches I've had! The picked cabbage complimented the sandwich well and i absolutely loved the flavor of the au jus sauce that came with the sandwich. For dessert, we tried the blueberry pie. Its good, but the goat cheese gelato was a little too over powering. I guess, if you like goat cheese, this dessert if for you. In the future, I'd probably opt for another dessert if they didn't have another flavor gelato or ice cream.
