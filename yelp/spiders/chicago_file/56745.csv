Smoque BBQ////Aside from these great perks, the food was very enjoyable too.  From word of mouth and Yelp reviews, I quickly realized that the brisket and St. Louis ribs are on point here.  So I ordered the "1/2 and 1/2" sandwich (half pulled pork, half brisket - either chopped or sliced) which came with cole slaw and 1 side (I chose mac & cheese) and added a 1/4 slab (~3 ribs) of St. Louis ribs for ~$15 after taxes.  Pretty affordable!  The pulled pork was my favorite, but I was also impressed with the extreme tenderness of the brisket.  However, I thought the St. Louis ribs tasted too smoky, the sauce for the sandwiches were a little too tangy (although the ribs sauce was just fine - ketchup-y, slightly sweet, and thick), and I wish the side portion of mac & cheese was larger.  But these aren't dealbreakers, as I was really content with the pulled pork and brisket.  I will definitely come back!
