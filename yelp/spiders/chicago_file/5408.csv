The Purple Pig////Food-only tried octopus dish and was amazing!!! Super tender and fresh. Seasoned with a pesto and oil sauce that was packed with flavor. Asparagus and baby potatoes complemented octopus perfectly. Honestly, you could've put this octopus in cardboard and it would've been amazing! Staff mentioned they marinated octopus in wine for 36 hours and then seat it on stove for maximum tenderness. Simply amazing, well done guys!!
