Little Goat Diner////THE FOOD WAS AMAZING. I think they have an Asian fusion kick inspiration, which as an Asian, I kinda stayed away from lol but it definitely looked innovative with lots of kimchi and spice. I got the chicken and waffles AND IT WAS SO GOOD - the chicken was in small bits so you didn't have to cut it yourself and it came with syrup and and strawberries, which I was a little wary of at first, BUT THE COMBINATION TOGETHER WAS PERFECT omgg I don't remember what my other friends got but I tried a bit and they were also very good (I have pics though!) would definitely recommend and would come again if I could.
