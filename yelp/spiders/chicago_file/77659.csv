Little Goat Diner////Very delicious sandwich I had here for dinner! My friend and I ended up near the West Loop. Although we had initially intended on getting dinner elsewhere, I'm so happy we got to eat at Little Goat Diner! We got there around 5PM and thankfully there wasn't a wait for us to get seated. The menu online is cutely presented, and I wish I could have tried more after finding out that this is the sister restaurant of the infamous Girl and the Goat across the street!!
