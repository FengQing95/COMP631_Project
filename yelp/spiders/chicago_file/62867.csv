Smoque BBQ////We finished with the mini peach cobbler, and I wouldn't leave without tasting this tiny $2.25 treat.  It was more of a crumble than a cobbler, mostly peaches and sugar under a little bit of crunchy crust.  It was sweet and fruity, with a softened fruit texture.  A couple spoonfuls made a nice cap to a meaty meal.
