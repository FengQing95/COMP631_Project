Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Who in Chicago hasn't gone to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba? This is the go-to restaurant when your cupboards are bare, and your friends are calling. Another typical spanish tapas restaurant, but unlike most of these places, they also have a great paella sampling for 2 should you opt not to get tapas.
