The Purple Pig////Overall, the service was great even though the restaurant was packed. We were lucky to find seats at the bar otherwise we wouldn't have been able to wait to be seated. Despite being a tight schedule, the staff were pleasant and accommodating to our needs. The food and drinks were served quickly and we even ordered a pork shoulder to go, because it was so good.
