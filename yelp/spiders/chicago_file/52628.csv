Smoque BBQ////I had a horrendous experience at smoke tonight. When I arrived at 6 PM I was in formed in a belligerent tone that no brisket was available tonight. Since brisket is the  primary attraction of Smoque,  the restaurant was rendered useless by virtue of this fact. Imagine McDonald's without hamburgers or Hot Dougs without hotdogs. That is the equivalent of Smoque without brisket. There is no excuse for this type of indifference to your customers. If this continues Smoque will no longer be a destination restaurant.  I certainly will not be going back.
