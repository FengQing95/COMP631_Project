Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////So we thought we'd give it a try.  I am a HUGE small plates person so you can imagine my delight when I saw that their brunch menu had both normal sized portions and also small plates portions.  Like a teeny tiny stack of pancakes or that mini french toast.  Or if you so choose, a normal sized omlette.  Oh, and the bloody mary bar- oh, I do adore a good bloody mary! And it's so fun to create your own- only I generally have no idea what I'm doing when left to my own devices.
