Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The food was great. That being said, when the bill came I was really surprised to see that my size small 3 topping pizza was $23.80. I was with a group of coworkers and tried to discreetly ask my waitress if that was correct, and she said it was. Not wanting to cause a scene, I accepted it and paid my bill. Now that I can look at a photo of the menu, it looks like I was charged 3 times what my pizza should have been. Do I have my math wrong? Really disappointed. Enjoy the food... then check your bill and make sure it's right.
