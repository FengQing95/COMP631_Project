Little Goat Diner////I have been patiently waiting for a friend to be free to go with to this amazing establishment!  Wait was well worth it!  I made my way over on a rainy day just to wash away the city in a cute diner atmosphere.  We took the liberty to avoid the wait and sit at the bar.  This quickly became a bad idea because it was very hot by the kitchen! It was exciting to see all the hussle behind the counter but felt stuffy and a little uncomfortable at the stools after a while.
