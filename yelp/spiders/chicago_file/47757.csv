Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I don't even know how any other tapas restaurant in the city could stay open with this place around. I mean, this is by far the best in town and personally I feel it's one of the best restaurants in the city! Without a doubt a go to spot when you're in the northside of Chicago.
