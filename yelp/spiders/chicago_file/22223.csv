Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came here on my first night in Chicago. It was a Friday and the wait was so long. It was pretty frustrating because we were only 2 and we saw lots of tables outside that were empty. They were not very efficient at seating people, which for a busy popular place that has texts for when your table is ready and a way to order your pizza ahead of time you'd expect them to be on top of turning tables around. They do allow you to place your pizza order before you get your table. Then when you sit down they put it in the oven to finish cooking. I guess that helps a bit, but when you've already waited an hour for a table, another 20-30 for your pizza feels like eternity. We even ordered to go mozzarella sticks to eat while we wait. They were very average. The pizza was good, but I wasn't a fan of the sausage. The crust isn't as deep as the deep dish pies I'm used to, but it was still filling. I much prefer Pi Pizza in St. Louis as well as my own recipe.
