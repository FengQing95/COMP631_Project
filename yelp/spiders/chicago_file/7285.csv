Art Institute of Chicago////Great place. Definitely worth a visit. I've been 30+ times and still find new things every time. So good, even your snooty European friends will be impressed. And don't forget, your ticket is good all day and for re-entry, so go early and when you're tired of standing, grab lunch for a couple hours and come back. Great time, great art.
