Smoque BBQ////I was greeted by a line out the door, which I bypassed since I ordered ahead for takeout (recommended). The line looked like it was moving quickly; I'd guess people were waiting about 20 minutes to order at 7pm on a Friday, and there were a few tables open for people to sit down. The cafeteria-style seating looked serviceable, but Smoque clearly isn't a destination for its atmosphere.
