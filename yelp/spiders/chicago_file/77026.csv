Little Goat Diner////Incredible food and super friendly staff. I got the goat chilli and "This little piggy went to China." The goat chilli is a must (can imagine it's especially great during the winter) and the "this little piggy.." dish was unique and absolutely delicious. Also tried the cinnabun which was super gooey (lived up to its name) and great if you're craving something sweet and the mac n cheese which was super cheesy and worth checking out. Portions are pretty big so expect to leave full.
