Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////But now that I think about it, the bad taste in my mouth really started even before we ate.  While the hostesses were friendly and pleasant, one of them kept on accosting it for not having our entire party there by the time of our reservation.  Our friend was running late as result of GPS failure (LOL), and let's just say, she was not the most hospitable when 30 minutes after our 9:45 p.m. reservation, she still wasn't there.  She then threatened us by saying they couldn't hold the reservation for much longer.  The mystery of course was that the place wasn't even busy and after we finally got seated, there were plenty of empty tables.  If there's anything I dislike, it's this type of petty restaurant "policy" that just manages to spoil a what could've been a beautiful dinner experience.  You see, I still believe that it is an experience - not just the food (although that's super important) but everything else that is associated with the restaurant.  Oh well...some places get that, I guess this place doesn't.
