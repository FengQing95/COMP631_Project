Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Every time I come to Ba ba Reeba I am never disappointed! I always make a reservation, but they have always been able to seat us 15 min early, which is great. The food here is AMAZING, you can come here 20 times and get different things each time. Everything tastes gourmet and I haven't found a dish I don't like here. Sangria is top notch- the pitcher is a great deal! Close to the L stop and there's usually street parking available.
