Smoque BBQ////I'm a vegetarian and yes I went anyway.  So this review is for the mac n' cheese and chocolate chip cookies.  So if there are any vegetarians wondering if it's worth the trip just for that, my vote is yes.  The portion is just enough.  It's cheezy, gooey and the crackling of the topping is addictive!  I also had the cornbread.  Meh.  I work about 3 minutes from here so if I'm ever in need of just a side to complete the lunch I brought to work, I'll definitely make the trip again!  Oh and the chocolate chip cookies were pretty delish too!
