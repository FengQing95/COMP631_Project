Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Why meat great till it gotta be great? There's so many great steak houses in the great city of Chicago, but this one might be my favorite. From the non pretentious vibe to the excellent old school service, to the food... each was excellent and has a sense originality without trying to be cool. This place has a speak easy feel to it paired with some modern drip. Â The prices are slightly less than the competition and the sides are what really stand out in this place. You may find a slightly better steak somewhere else but, but the entire meal as a whole is something to be rivaled. Share at least 5 sides and as everyone else has stated, don't pass up the thick cut bacon!
