Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My first observation of this place was that it is huge! They have several dining room sections and was packed when we went in for a 1:30 brunch reservation. Since we chose a later brunch time we were able to select from the brunch menu or regular dinner/ lunch menu. It also happened to be restaurant week, so there was a prix fixe brunch menu that included a drink of your choice (sangria, mimosa, or a trip to their Bloody Mary bar), 2 brunch tapas, and a dessert for $24.
