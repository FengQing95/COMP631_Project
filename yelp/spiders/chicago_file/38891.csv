Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It was GREAT! The bacon was amazing. Like mouth watering perfection. The thick slices of beefsteak tomatoes are perfectly grilled/roasted and at the bottom of the crisp watercress for those who aren't big fans of those ruby gems. I on the other hand, ate it up. My only issue was someone went a bit heavy handed on the fresh ground pepper. I'm a big fan of pepper, but i was scraping off the mound of it on the bacon after the first few bites of grit. It was a bit much, but once aside, it was an excellent start to the meal. I got the "half size" for a whopping $2 less than the full, so yeah, not exactly a bargain...
