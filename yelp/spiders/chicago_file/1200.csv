Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Tucked inside an office building, Wildberry is a hidden gem.  I ordered a chicken and spinach salad with goat cheese, dried cranberries, hard boiled eggs, bacon, candied walnuts, and a honey cinnamon dressing .  No joke ... There must have been 6 cups of spinach on that salad .  Monstrous.  The chicken was served cold ... Bummer. It would have been much better if freshly grilled.  The egg breakfasts and pancakes were good .  Cappuccino was just okay. (huge 20 oz. mug) Service was speedy despite a full house of diners!
