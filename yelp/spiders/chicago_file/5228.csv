The Purple Pig////The cauliflower was good. The flavor was good but nothing out of the ordinary. The bone marrow was pretty good. I haven't seen a bone that big! It was nice to see and a really good portion. The herbs on top was nice and enhance the flavor. The bread was perfect, not to crunch and each to bite into. I would definitely get the bone marrow. The pork shoulder was great. Sooo soft and had the nice meat flavor. The mashed potatoes that came with it was like smooth and really blended. It was interesting. Last we had the turkey leg cooked in fat. It was amazing how the meat just fell off the bone. It was very tasty. I would recommend the shoulder over the turkey leg.
