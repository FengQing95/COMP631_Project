Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I came here on vacation with my friend and it was amazing! It was my first time trying Chicago deep dish pizza and it certainly did not disappoint. Staff were all incredibly friendly, 10/10 would come again! The only downside is a 35 minute wait for deep dish, but honestly I really appreciated that everything was made to order.
