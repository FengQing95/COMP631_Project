Little Goat Diner////I was visiting Chicago for the Valentines weekend and was told to stop by here for brunch. Never have I been so impressed.  The service was amazing, the Bloody Mary was to-die for and the breakfast burrito... Wow!  It was unique, delicious and beautifully on display on the plate.
