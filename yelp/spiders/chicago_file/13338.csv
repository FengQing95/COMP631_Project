Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Being a tourist in Chicago, your trip isn't complete without trying some deep-dish pizza - so, with that thought in mind, my Hubs and I walked over to Lou Malnatti's.  It was around 2pm, and the place was packed.  We were seated right away, and ordered the Manati Chicago Classic.  We were told that it would take 30 minutes for the pizza.
