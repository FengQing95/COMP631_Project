Art Institute of Chicago////This was my second favorite location of the City Pass ticket book. They have so many great exhibits and so many great artists. Plenty of Monet and Renoir and so much surrealism. I felt like I didn't have nearly enough time to spend here to see everything and would be more than happy to pay for another day pass to see more. I truly felt like I was in Ferris Buhler's Day Off and chuckled to myself each time I recognized a piece of artwork from the movie. It's a great museum and am definitely going back to see everything I can.
