Art Institute of Chicago////There is so much to see here, you almost need two days to see it all! They have really built up some excellent exhibit space, particularly in the medieval and renaissance halls.  The cafe is outrageously expensive, a wrap costing $12.  We came with our grandmother who was getting around with a cane.  We quickly realized that certain parts of the building were not designed well for accessibility.  For example, some bathrooms off the modern hall entrance required to move two sets of heavier doors.  Grandma actually hurt herself and came out into the hall bleeding after one of the doors was almost impassible for her.
