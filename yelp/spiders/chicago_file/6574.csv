The Purple Pig////Pork Belly ($23): One of their signature dishes, and it almost lived up to the hype. The pork belly itself was very good and tender. The outside crust was caramelized and the inside had a good balance of meat and fat. The sauce complemented it very well. The rest of the dish didn't balance out the flavor, though. The other things on the plate are supposed to provide contrast to the ultra-richness/fatness of the pork belly, but the pickled carrots were a little too overwhelming. I liked the addition of some greens and radishes, but it wasn't enough. For the most part, the dish is good... but my standards are a little higher because I've had really good pork belly at other restaurants already. Plus, this was expensive.
