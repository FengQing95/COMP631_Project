Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I wasn't actually interested in a larger size--but why say that and then not deliver?  However, The real problem was the delay.  Your estimate for pick up times should not be that far off. Ordering the pizza was supposed to be a quick dinner solution after a late evening pediatrician appointment on a school night--minutes count.
