Little Goat Diner////Once again.... Hype overshadows poor quality.  I'm not sure why this chicks restaurants are so highly rated. I've had better food cooked by Sue and Bob in rural Kentucky. And I didn't have to take out a second mortgage. $9 for Mac n chz???  Good? Average. Sloppy joe...Manwich. nachos were the only thing worth the money. Did you see my picture of our pie???  Crap. Thank God Izard won a cooking show. Without her celeb status I don't think she could keep her food places open.
