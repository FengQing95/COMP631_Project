Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This review is only for the bar. We stopped in after a cooking class at the Chopping Block for a drink. I had heard this place was pretty cool. I have to say, the whole 'speakeasy' thing is a little over done, but I loved Bavette's! I thought they really got it right, it really felt like I was in Boardwalk Empire or something! Love the music, bartenders (Andrew was ours and he was great, he explained all the crazy things he was putting in various drinks, which was cool), ambiance. I tried the Champagne Cocktail and the Champagne Crush. The Cocktail was my favorite. My husband had the manhatten on the menu and said it was great. Overall, awesome place. I will be back for sure, for dinner this time!
