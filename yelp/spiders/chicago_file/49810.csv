Smoque BBQ////Now, looking at some recent reviews, I recall something else.  That because some were written by some tourists who actually photograph their food, themselves, and who eat way too much.  Aside from gluttony, these reviews feature food photos which remind me of all the plastic, polystyrene and disposable junk in which nearly all of Smoque's dishes are served.  This is a small-site EPA disaster area, all by itself, but the fat women could care less.
