Little Goat Diner////Little Goat is great. Very busy so expect to wait a little. Only been a few times but each time staff was really helpful and made good suggestions. Some breakfast items are pretty standard, basic diner. The standouts really pop though! You can roam into the coffee bar while you wait and get a drink. Parking usually not too bad.
