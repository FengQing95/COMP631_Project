Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Without a clean environment to eat in, we just couldn't enjoy the food. When I see that the front of the house looks like this, I wonder how much worse the kitchen is. I typically make a scene but the family frowns upon this so, I ordered their specialty pizza; the sausage was baked together as a layer in the pie and just made it taste like dog food.
