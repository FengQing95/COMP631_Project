Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My coworker and I stopped in for Chicago-style pizza because we were in town for work.  We found this place through Yelp! We were really looking forward to good Chicago deep dish pizza.  The only place I'd been to in the past that had a great crust was Uno's (another Chicago chain). We decided to sit at the bar since the wait for a table was quite long, and a couple stools opened up at the bar.
