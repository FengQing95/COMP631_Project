Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////3) Steak and Frites with a side of Garlic Aoili: We ordered the steak cooked to a medium temperature and it came out perfect. We used some of the steak salt that was provided as a side to the dish, which I enjoyed since many restaurants oversalt their steaks. Nothing about the steak really stood out to me flavor wise, it was good but nothing to write home about in comparison to other steakhouses in the neighborhood. The frites, on the other hand, were outstanding and quickly disappeared along with the garlic aoili.
