Little Goat Diner////Brunch review: delectable, sweet, and innovative brunch menu options worth the wait. It's the buzzy younger sister of Girl and the Goat that leans toward comfort food. My friend and I dined on the Fat Elvis waffles and apple cinnamon pancakes, which were both rich and hearty. Disappointed that on two occasions the gooey cinnamon rolls had run out; it's true, you really have to get them early! Food is incredible, but venue receives four stars out of five because it is crowded, crowded, crowded. It's first come, first serve, which results in hoards of people waiting. The adjacent coffee bar is a nice waiting space but is often shoulder to shoulder. Many patrons stand outside the door while waiting for their table. I've been recommending brunch here to many friends, with the forewarning that a long wait is inevitable.
