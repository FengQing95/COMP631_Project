Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Just about the best deep dish pizza I've had in life thus far... The "lean" sausage was excellent, the pizza came together very surprisingly well! I ordered a personal size of their original sausage pizza over the phone 30 minutes before arrival and ate it at the bar. I will definitely be back in the near future...
