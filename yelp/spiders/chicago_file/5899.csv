The Purple Pig////The spanish octopus was so tender and well seasoned, along with the vegetables that came with it. The ricotta gnocchi was also really yummy! The best, my personal favorite, was the half duck. The duck was so crispy on the outside yet moist and tender on the inside. There was a sweet glaze to it that was so well-paired with the greek yogurt on the plate.
