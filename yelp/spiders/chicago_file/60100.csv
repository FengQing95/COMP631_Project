Smoque BBQ////I try to be fair when writing a review my experience with this restaurant was take out and ribs. I was very disappointed in rib entrée. The ribs were tough, not very meaty and lacked the flavor one would expect from such a popular restaurant who's very name screams what should be delicious!  I would not recommend this restaurant for ribs. I also had a side if bbq bean that weren't bad. Now to be fair some of my friends and family get the pulled pork sandwiches from there and they love it. So, my recommendation is if you're looking for good ribs...look elsewhere but if you're looking for a pulled pork sandwich. .. give it a try. Happy dining :)
