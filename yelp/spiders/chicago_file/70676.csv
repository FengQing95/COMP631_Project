Little Goat Diner////The service was mediocre.  The restaurant was busy, but I often had to ask others for help because my server was no where to be found.  No one was friendly, just barely courteous.  When my friend and I go to the host and hostess, they both walked away and we had to wait for them to return to even put our names on the list.
