Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is a super happening place that delivered on fun environment, great food and terrific service. We had Marilyn as our server and she was a delight, especially as she coached us through the extensive menu since we were newbies. We will be back for sure. Loved all of the tapas we tried...don't miss the goat cheese in tomato sauce, the olives, the steak with blue cheese...oh and the empanadas. I mean, the whole experience was terrific. We will be back again - we are out of towners who visit our son at school.
