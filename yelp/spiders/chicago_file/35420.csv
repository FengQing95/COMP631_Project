Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////    Now back to the menu. For starters, the crab cake is a must. Packed with more crab than cake, seared and not completely breaded. It's definitely worth a try. The bone marrow is also an excellent appetizer. The homemade sourdough bread and caramelized onion jam offer a flavorful bite. The journey of flavors continues with the main courses offered. The Steak Frites are a number one pick. The steak was tender flavorful and paired excellently with the crispy fries. The lamb chops and fried chicken were also superb. These flavorful sides were an excellent accompaniment to the our entrees. The asparagus, mashed potatoes and mac n' cheese. The sides are pretty large portions and best shared. Your meal would not be complete without a slice of their carrot cake.
