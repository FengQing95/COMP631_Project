Smoque BBQ////Hot Damn!!!!! Hands down best BBQ I've had!! When you see a line out the door you know your in the right spot. I had the sliced brisket sandwich,Mac and cheese side with a taste of the ribs..... A day later I'm writing this review and my mouth is watering. Please don't let the lack if parking and long lines deter you, you will regret it!!!
