Art Institute of Chicago////Impressionism is my absolute favorite art form.  Impressionists, such as Monet, Renoir and van Gogh are my absolute favorites, and here each is wonderfully represented in the permanent collection.  There are lots of others, of course, including Seurat with his most famous 'Sunday on La Grand Jatte,' Caillebotte with 'Paris Street, Rainy Day - 1884' (which is absolutely stunning), and a number of others - including Manet and Toulouse Lautrec.  I'd have been delighted with my visit here if these had been the only objects d'art on display - but wow, was there ever a lot more to see!
