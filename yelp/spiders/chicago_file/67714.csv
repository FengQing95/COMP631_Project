Little Goat Diner////I really want to love this place, but I don't. I don't love the food. Tonight was my fourth time dining. One might ask why go someplace you don't love, 4 times. Great question. I usually go because a friend is in town, or another friend who hasn't gone, wants to go. While the food isn't bad, it's far from great. It's not impressive. Not a whole lot of flavor. For example, tonight I had the grilled cheese. While it wasn't bad, it wasn't anything special. Yes it had olive & tomatoes, but it lacked any real flavor. During a prior visit I ordered the omelet, which was also disappointing. It's not a bad experience. Just don't go hoping to be impressed.
