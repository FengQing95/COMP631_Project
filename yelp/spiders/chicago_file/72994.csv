Little Goat Diner////Ok last trip, tried the dark chocolate chip pancakes. They were massive and a bit more on the savory side as well, not too sweet as they use a sourdough base to the pancake batter. It was accompanied by the barrel wood aged syrup that went really well with the pancakes. A great choice if you have a sweet & savory tooth.
