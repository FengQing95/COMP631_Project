Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I just got back from Spain, so I was jonesing for some Tapas.  I took my mother here since she was in town, and she loved it.  It has a fun, boisterous atmosphere--a little loud, so not really a romantic date spot.  We started with Sangria--raspberry and peach--both good.  Then we tried several Tapas dishes.  First, we had a couple of cold dishes--the garlic potato salad was delicious, as was the eggplant and goat cheese salad.  The gazpacho wasn't awful, but it certainly wasn't as good as what I had in Spain.  It was actually a little spicy, which I personally didn't like. Then we had spinach stuffed mushrooms, which were decent and my mom had  chorizo and chicken skewers, which she said were delicious (I don't eat meat).  This and too much bread and we were already full, so we decided to save room for dessert.  Next to us, they were serving a seafood paella which looked delicious--but we were way too full for paella at this point.  We ordered the chocolate flan, which was what I was most looking forward to but probably liked the least.  We also had the lemon cake, which was delicious, the coconut milk soaked bread pudding (also very good) and the dessert special, which was an orange tart.  The tart was pretty dry, but the orange filling was good.  Overall, there were a ton of choices, it was reasonably priced and much of it tasted authentic.  I plan on going back for the Flamenco show!
