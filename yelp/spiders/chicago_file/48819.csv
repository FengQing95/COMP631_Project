Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I am typically not a tapas person, but my girlfriend has converted me.  They have a huge menu and the service is typically top notch.  Occasionally their kitchen will get backed up, but they do get your food out to you very quick.  I recommend switching it up every time you go, but do make sure that their spicy potatoes are ordered at every visit!
