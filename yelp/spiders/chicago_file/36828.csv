Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Now onto the food. My friends and I shares the Pommes Frites with Garlic Aioli, Elote Style Corn, and a salad (oops don't remember what it was called). For entree, I ordered the petit filet mignon. I also had the Bavette's Punch (outstanding! it is a little fruity and sweet which I like!). The steak was good, a little salty for me but I will have to try the others next time. But the Pommes frites and corn are awesome! I would return just for those items! We capped off dinner with malt whiskey gelato that comes with fudge served on the side. Delicious!
