Smoque BBQ////When we walked in the door, we were greeted by a packed house. We wanted to sit inside so I quickly looked around for an empty table but were soon told that once we placed our order, we would be directed to a table. After viewing all of the choices, we settled on pulled pork. The hype is true...their pulled pork was amazing. They drizzle a bit of BBQ sauce over the pork and they also provide a side of additional BBQ sauce. We also got a side of coleslaw and fries. The coleslaw was probably the best I ever had. It wasn't creamy or sour at all (I find most coleslaw to be this way). It almost tasted like it was tossed in Italian dressing, sooooo good! The fries were also perfect...warm, super crisp and seasoned well. One side order of fries was pretty large so you might want to split with someone.
