Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I love the open atmosphere. We ended up sitting on the edge of the restaurant where the patio meets the inside seating but everything was opened up since the weather was so nice. The waiter was very friendly and attentive. We ordered a regular deep dish pizza and a gluten free pizza for myself.
