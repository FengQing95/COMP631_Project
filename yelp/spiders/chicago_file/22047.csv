Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This pizza was really good. It was my first experience with deep dish pizza and I especially loved the crust. However, I think the ratio of sauce to cheese wasn't balanced. Too much sauce in my opinion. But, would definitely recommend because overall, the pizza had good flavor.
