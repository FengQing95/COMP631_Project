Smoque BBQ////I'd say the highlight of the meal was the SIDES. The coleslaw and bbq beans were pretty good (probably b/c they were so sweet?). The mac and cheese was great as well, esp. since the top had that crispy part with breadcrumbs. Also, you must try the peach cobber. It's one of the best I've had. You could come here and just get sides and feel like you had a satisfying meal.
