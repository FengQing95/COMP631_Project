Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Whenever I'm asked by "out of town" people where to go for the best Chicago pizza, I say Lou Malnati's.  The deep dish pizza is my absolute favorite in the city!  The Lou Malnati's salad is also a must!!!!  They don't take reservations but the wait is never that bad!  You can always have a drink at the bar and relax:)  I've been here so many times I've lost count!
