Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Does this place need any more positive reviews?  Got here Sunday night when wait time was reported to be 30 to 45 min.  They let you "pre order" your pizza although my theory is that it really does nothing but keep you from leaving when you get weary of waiting for your table.  Pizza was superb.  I personally don't love deep dish pizza but if I'm going to visit Chicago, I'll do Lou Malnati's.
