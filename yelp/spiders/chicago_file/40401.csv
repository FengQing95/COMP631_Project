Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////F&B: We ordered the Porterhouse Steak, which was perfect for our family of four, cooked to perfection, Brussel Sprouts (the best I've had, and I order this dish often), Mac and Cheese (incredible), and the dessert Chocolate Creme Pie (so silky and good, like a creamy Oreo). The complimentary bread was great too (and huge!) with easy to spread butter with a bit of salt!
