Little Goat Diner////My boyfriend and I stopped in at Little Goat for a late night dinner. We were really happy with everything! Our server was really great (although stretched pretty thin) and at the end of the meal apologized for not spending as much time with us as she would have liked. I got the chive pancake with pork belly and hoisin sauce and it was this combination of salty fatty carby goodness that was so good I only came up for air to steal bites of my boyfriend's croque monster, a giant ham egg and cheese omelette. All of the food coming out of the kitchen looked so good that I'm excited to go back.
