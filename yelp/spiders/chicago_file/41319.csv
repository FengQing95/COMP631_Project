Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went her last year with my Bouse-Do-You crew, but remembered I liked the place. I liked it so much I brought my husband back to let him taste the butterscotch flan and the bacon wrapped dates mmmmmm and mmmmmm again. My husband said the same. Great customer service. The Paella was Â too bland for my group.
