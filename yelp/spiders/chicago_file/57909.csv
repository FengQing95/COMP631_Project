Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My advice would be to make sure you leave room for dessert, which is hard to do because they have such a large, delicious offering of entree plates, you don't want to stop. But stop, trust me. We ordered the Caramelized Banana ($3.50), with vanilla ice cream, quince syrup, and toasted pistachios; a great option to end a meal with a sweet, yet not-too-rich dessert. The Chocolate Truffle Cake ($3.50), with kahlua, whipped cream was rich and decadent--make sure your belly is ready for this delicous cake. Saving the best for last again was the Marcona Almond-Caramel Bar ($3.50) with whpped cream and a butter crust--YUM. This too was rich, so beware.
