Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is HUGE. The most cavernous of cavernous restaurants compared to others in the area. This is because it is Lettuce Entertain You, which is probably the reason for its slight meh-ness some nights. I am not sure if people know this. Normally people are such chain snobs that I'm surprised it's not pointed out more frequently here.
