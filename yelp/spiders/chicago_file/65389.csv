Smoque BBQ////I went with the half rack baby backs, with brisket chili and beans.  The ribs were ridiculously good.  Smoky, deliciously seasoned, slight pull...absolutely perfect, just the way I remembered from several years ago.  Use the sauce just to enhance, if you must, but the dry rub is delicious on its own...the sign of a truly great BBQ.
