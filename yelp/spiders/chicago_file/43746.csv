Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is obviously one of the better known Tapas places in the city and its definitely worth checking out. On a Friday and Saturday night the place is usually packed and they are now taking reservations (not sure when that changed). If you're in the 'hood definitely stop in, its a great spot to share a few plates...
