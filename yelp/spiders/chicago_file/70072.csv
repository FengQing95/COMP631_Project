Little Goat Diner////We cannot wait to come back for lunch, though I'm not sure if there's a time that won't have a wait.  Come 8:30 am on a Sunday this place was packed.  The bakery next door is great with more of that friendly service.  We bought a broccoli cheese bread that smelled just like the soup (and YUM!) and her Saute sauce which makes those stellar green beans at Girl and the Goat.
