Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I'm disappointed in this restaurants lack of communication, and I'm disappointed that i had 10 people to feed who couldn't eat.  Not only does cafe ba-ba-reeba have 10 people who will NEVER eat here again, they have multiple Chicago locals who will never recommend this restaurant to eat at to others.  I'm embarrassed, along with all the others who stated this restaurant was classy and well equipped.  Ba Ba Reeba's lack of communication has caused a great amount of people to never dine at their establishment again.
