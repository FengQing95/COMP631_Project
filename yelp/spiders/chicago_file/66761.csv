Little Goat Diner////Just had an awesome breakfast here (at noon). I sat at the counter so I got to peep all the dishes as they came to the pass. Everything, but especially the fish tostadas which everyone seemed to order, looked amazing. On the first of what will be many visits I had the Bull's Eye French Toast. The bull's eye being a sunny side up egg cooked in the center of each sweet onion brioche slab of French toast. It's served up with fried chicken, bbq maple syrup, and gooseberries which serve wonderfully to cut the richness of the dish. For dessert I had the smoked pork and toffee shake. Unbelievably savory and delicious Can't wait to return for lunch to try some of those amazing looking sammiches, and eventually a dinner.
