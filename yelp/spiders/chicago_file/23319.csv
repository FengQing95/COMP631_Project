Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm an East Coast guy so not really a deep dish pizza fan but I went here with a coworker one night and will admit I left happily satisfied.  My first was deep dish from one of the famous Chicago deep dish places was way too greasy and just had too much of everything leaving me with that i just swallowed a brick feeling.  I was hesitant to go here but my coworker wanted deep dish.
