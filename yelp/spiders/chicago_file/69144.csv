Little Goat Diner////I blame the subpar food and really slow service to 2nd day of opening.  It took about 45 mins to get our food and it all came out at once, really wish my salad was brought out before my main entree.  I had the fried chicken which was over fried and over salted/seasoned.  The mac and cheese was really disappointing, kind of oily and seemed like it had been sitting around for a while and reheated.  My caesar was not fresh, overdressed and again had been sitting around dressed.  The croutons were a let-down.  Friends had some breakfast items which they felt were just okay, I didn't taste.
