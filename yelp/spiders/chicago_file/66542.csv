Little Goat Diner////My experience was excellent. Service with a smile and fast. I had the Los Drowned (braised beef) sandwich, it was arguably the best thing I have ever eaten. Went on a Tuesday evening, no wait, sat right down. Many people complain about the wait at peak times but that comes with the territory with all the top restaurants in Chicago. We shared the crab dip as well, also excellent. My GF had the fried pickle sandwich which was also excellent and unique. Finished the evening with a warm cookie pie...do I need to tell you how good it was? It's a warm cookie pie, enough said.
