Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Atmosphere.  Seems like this is the new look for Chicago restos.  Tres chic.  Here's what impressed me:  ordered and Irish coffee & it took a few minutes because the bartender got a french!press! from the kitchen and made my drink w/that.  That's a first for me.  Talk about service.  We were seated downstairs for dinner, which is more of the dark, loungey area, but still full restaurant area.  It was dark.  Waiter was very nice.  Atmosphere was fine, but all things being equal I'd prefer upstairs.  Had the wedge and it was the worst I've ever had.  The lettuce was flavorless and tough.  Odd.  The dressing was NOT bleu cheese, it was thin, runny ranch.  Yech!  The filet was superb - the best I've had in a loooong time.  The creamed spinach was good.  I've been on a classic steakhouse menu binge of wedge, filet, creamed spinach lately, so I've got a good basis of comparison going.  :)  Overall, I'd return but prefer to sit upstairs, would go out of my way to order Irish coffee, and probably just return for the delicious filet.  Mmmmmmm.  But if the over made-up 19 year old hostess pays me and my dining companion gushing, so-fake-it's-insulting-and-patronizing compliments on our attire again, I swear I'll slap her face off.
