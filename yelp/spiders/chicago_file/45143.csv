Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////4. salmon, celery root puree, kale chips & sea salt: not exactly your traditional tapas dish (last I checked, no salmon swimming around the Mediterranean), but delicious nevertheless. Salmon was perfectly cooked & seasoned, celery root puree was flavor & texture-wise spot on. Kale chips, though crispy and delicious, were not quite enough to add a textural contrast to the dish. Only a minor complaint, would definitely order again.
