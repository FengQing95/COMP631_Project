Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////unlike the food, the service wasnt all too great. the only time our server Â came by our table was to take our orders, bring our pizzas, and give us the check. we had to ask 2 different people for more water and for the extra peppers our initial server forgot. we had 2 separate orders of pizzas at our table and he boxed all the leftovers together. i know i sound nit picky and all, but it's common sense. ask first if the customer needs separate boxes!
