Little Goat Diner////Was pleasantly surprised to be told that it would only be a 15 minute wait at around 7:30pm on opening night. Was even more pleasantly surprised to be offered 3 bar seats opened after only 5 minutes of waiting. Â It was really cool to sit at the bar facing the kitchen, and seeing Chef Izard working the line. I was impressed with how organized and (relatively) calm the cooks and chefs looked, and the service was great!
