Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is one of my family's favorites in the city. Everything is always incredible. If you're getting drinks, tapas & dessert plan for around $40 a person- not too bad for amazing drinks& foods in a great setting. I am impartial to Spain since I studied abroad there & being at cafe babareeba brings me back to my days of living the Spanish lifestyle. The brick lined walls and dimly lit Interier is swanky and perfect for whatever the occasion. Sangria was strong and not just juice. Dessert was on point. Tapas were all served hot& in good spacing time-wise. We will be returning time & time again.
