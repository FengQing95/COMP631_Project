Art Institute of Chicago////No wonder this place is voted the best museum in the world for the past few years! I could go there every day and still see something new on each visit. I love that there is such a variety of topics inside so that I can just go to a different section on each visit when my mood changes. I definitely recommend getting a yearly membership if you are living in Chicago because it pays for itself once you visit 4 times and I promise you will there more than that!
