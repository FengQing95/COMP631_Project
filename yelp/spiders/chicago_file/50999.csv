Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I highly recommend the seafood paella. I had seafood paella in Valencia (where paella originated) & this restaurant surpasses Valencia's 110%. I loved the garlic potatoes, octopus, spicy shrimp tapas. (Sorry I can't be more specific) Everything on the menu is great honestly. You can't go wrong.
