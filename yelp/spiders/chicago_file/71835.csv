Little Goat Diner////Awesome design and really cool feel.  We had great service, the menu is ridonk, and the prices are quite reasonable for the quality of food.  My wife had this special which was a bunch of fresh arugula and other goodies with eggs on top of naan bread, while I had the crispy chicken french toast concoction, both of which blew our collective minds.  Plus we were basically full until we had a very, very late lunch (It was almost dunch.  Or is it linner?).
