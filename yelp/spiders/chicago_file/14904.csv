Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My wife and I went here for dinner on our most recent Chicago visit.  We walked in and were told that it would be about 30 minutes for a table.  That's fine - we weren't in a rush so we grabbed a couple of stools at the bar.  4 minutes later, the hostess was yelling my wife's name.  So, we ended up not even waiting 5 minutes for a table when we were told it would be a half hour.  We were seated upstairs - the restaurant itself is not huge.  The bar is also tiny and they probably only had about 6 beers or less on tap.
