Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////-Not making a huge deal about it being the Chicago thing -- deep dish pizza. Oh my god, it's deep dish pizza! Ethel, get out your camera and I'll take your picture with the pizza! They'll be so jealous back in Moline, gee! Okay, sorry about that... the point is, Malnati's doesn't assume deep dish pizza eaters are rubes from corn country. They just make pizza.
