Little Goat Diner////Little Goat is a great twist on diner food. It is perfect for someone looking for a little adventure with the comfort food classics.  I love all the unique items on the menu like the Korean Burger and the Parathas Burrito.  I have been there a handful of times and never have been disappointed.  My all time favorite item on the menu is "Fat Elvis Waffles".  It doesn't get better than waffles with peanut butter-butter,maple syrup bacon, and bananas.
