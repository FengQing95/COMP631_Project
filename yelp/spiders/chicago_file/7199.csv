Art Institute of Chicago////Cetainly one of the greatest Art Museums in the US, even if it is signifcantly eclipsed in size by other institutions.  The highlights here -- for anyone going for the first time -- are the Impressionist collection and the American paintings.  Nice 20th century collection too, and the Thorne Rooms will delight litte girls as well as adults.  Museum layout is fairly simple and much easier to navigate than, for example, the Met.  Museum shop is large and first rate and unlike many other museum stores has truly great clearance sales with really amazing buys (late summer and late winter are best to look).    Weaknesses here are non-European art (collections on display could be larger) and ancient/medieval stuff.   Great icons:  American Gothic, Nighthawks, the El Greco altarpiece and Sunday on the Grand Jatte.
