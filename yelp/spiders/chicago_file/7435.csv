Art Institute of Chicago////After we got out of the French Middle Ages exhibit (which literally put me to sleep) everything else was awesome!  The modern stuff was really cool and I really liked the new Chagall exhibit -- this blue stained glass thing that was kind of gorgeous.  They also had an Impressionists wing that was really pretty and had a bunch of paintings you always see in books and things.  I especially liked all the water lilies there.
