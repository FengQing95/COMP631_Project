Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Packed up the rest of the pizza in a box. Unfortunately, by the time we got back to our apartment the pizza slices had formed into a layered pizza block. Put in the fridge and surprisingly it was delicious cold as well the next day on my flight back. Even if it was cold, it was better than any airport food I could have bought.
