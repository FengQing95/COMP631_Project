Little Goat Diner////This place is excellent-everything we had was fresh, flavorful and unique.  The decor, friendly staff, the food.....start with a Little Goat or if you want a cocktail, The Fizz is fresh and refreshing!  I ordered the trout my husband ordered shrimp and grits-both amazing choices!  Make sure to take home some bread or baked goods from the bakery...we've tried 5 different types of bread and they are all unique and flavorful.  I don't think you can make any bad choices at this place to be honest!
