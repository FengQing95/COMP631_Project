Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Fantastic!  One of the best places for tapas that I've ever been to.    We had a phenominal waiter (I think his name is Joe - ask for his section).  He was funny, knew the menu and had excellent recommendations.   They offer everything from bacon-wrapped scallops (a favorite of mine) to potato salad, to pork kabobs.   Something for everyone.
