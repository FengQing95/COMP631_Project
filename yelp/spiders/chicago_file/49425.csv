Smoque BBQ////My sister was visiting from California and she insisted we try this place she heard about - I'm so glad we did! The food is really great. I absolutely love the mac and cheese (YUMMO). I had the BBQ chicken and my sister had the BBQ beef brisket. I liked the brisket better - especially with the slaw. Took a beef brisket sandwich home for lunch the next day hehe. I can't wait to go again!
