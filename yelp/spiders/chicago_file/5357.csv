The Purple Pig////With 6,000 reviews and a 4/5 rating I thought my experience at The Purple Pig would be much more satisfying than it turned out to be. Don't get me wrong my meal was good, but it's not worth it to wait for a long time since they don't take reservations. If I lived in Chicago and recommending friends on where to eat in a short amount of time, this would not be in the top 5 places to eat...
