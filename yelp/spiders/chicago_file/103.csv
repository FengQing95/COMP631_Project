Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The service was good and we got there early enough that we didn't have to wait. The prices were high but nothing out of the ordinary for the Loop. Honestly, I wouldn't go back. The price wasn't worth the food. I've had waaaaaaaaay better (amazing!) omelettes at Yolk and Bongo Room has that delicious chocolate tower French toast :) I kind of felt like a tourist going into Wildberry. I feel that there are a lot better places to go to for breakfast within a few blocks of this place that are way more worth the time and money.
