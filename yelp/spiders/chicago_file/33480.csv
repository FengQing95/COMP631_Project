Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great ambiance! Very stylish, low key, and elegant dining area. This is an ideal place to take someone for a nice night out. The food was also top notch. Oysters were fantastic. My salmon was done perfectly. I loved all the sides, but especially the butternut squash. I don't eat red meat, but others said the steaks were excellent. The service was good, but I think given the atmosphere and prices at Bavette's, it should have been a bit better. There were a couple times when it was hard to track down our server.
