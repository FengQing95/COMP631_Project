Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've had frozen Lou's pizza togo-ed and baked it at home, and I honestly liked it better because I managed to get the crust to be little more crunchier. I'm not sure if you can ask them to make the crust extra crispy when you order, but if they're able to, I'd give it a chance.
