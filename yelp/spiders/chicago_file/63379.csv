Smoque BBQ////We went for father's day. This place has 5 star Service and more importantly 5 star food. I got the half and half dinner. Sandwich and half slab rib. The sandwich  I was able to get half pulled pork and half brisket. The pulled pork was absolutely  spot on! Did not need the extra  bbq sauce given, this can stand on it's own feet. The brisket was very good. It was soft and cooked right. The ribs...wow. done right. Soft inside a little  crispy outside. Absolutely solid! The cornbread was made like mom made. My kids through down the mac n cheese. The brisket Chile was good.  Not the best item on the menu when the meat courses are superior. I would recommend like a cinnamon apple sauce or cinnamon apple mix.
