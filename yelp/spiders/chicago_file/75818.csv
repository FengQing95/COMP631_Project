Little Goat Diner////Super chill place for brunch and food any time of the day. Had their cauliflower bibimbap which was extremely healthy. I loved the cauliflower and all the toppings. Very good. Friend got the chicken and French toast. Chicken was good and the French toast was nice and fluffy and sweet. It had an interesting oniony flavor added to it for savoriness.
