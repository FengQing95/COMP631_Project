Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The deep dish pizza pretty much rocks, and I don't even really like pizza.  The buttered crust is tasty but very thick and hearty.  I suggest requesting extra tomato sauce on the pizza since they come over flowing with cheese and it makes them a bit too dry without.  And trust me, a small is big enough for most two person parties, especially if you're ordering a side or an appetizer.
