Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////...So for the past couple of weeks (OK maybe a month) every time we had meetings preparing for this meeting I would say, "OK, team, the most important thing for this upcoming meeting is for us to go get Chicago style deep dish pizza..." I wonder if my colleagues got annoyed of me saying that... Hehehe... Anyway so... We got here to Chicago and all of us that were on the SFO to ORD flight were starving... So I said, "Deep dish pizza?" (Borderline obnoxious, I know.) Within 20 minutes (after saying hellos to a bunch of other folks we ran into in the lobby) we were on our way to Lou Malnati's (which was recommended by the kind concierge at the Westin River North lobby)...
