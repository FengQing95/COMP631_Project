Little Goat Diner////When we eventually got seated, the three of us ordered burgers, beers, and some fries to share. The food was decent, but not exceptional, and none of us left feeling quite as satisfied as we had hoped. It was also slightly more expensive than I had expected, but as I already suggested, this may just be because I was under the impression it was a typical diner, which it isn't.
