Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tapas isn't my favorite, but Ba-Ba-Reeba makes for a pretty consistently good time. I haven't eaten a lot of their seemingly tasty food, but I'd like to share a few little known treats. Let's not forget that when you say tapas to a suburbanite, the consistent responses are Ba-Ba-Reeba and Cafe Iberico. Â
