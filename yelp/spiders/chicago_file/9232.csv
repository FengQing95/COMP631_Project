Art Institute of Chicago////Simply put, this is one of the best and important things Chicago has over many other American cities. This museam rivals those of the Louve and the Uffizi to name a few and has probably the largest amount of well known or art used in pop culture. Other than the Mona Lisa, this place has all of those pieces of art that you are familiar with and those which you should know. Also, while its $18 to enter, that can be considered a steal compared to what they charge at other places and its free during certain times. It is a real treat to visit these great works of art at least once or twice a year.
