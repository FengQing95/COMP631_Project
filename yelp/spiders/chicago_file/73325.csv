Little Goat Diner////Little Goat has a bright, modern aesthetic, semi-loud music, and an eclectic menu that covers items like goat chili and kimchi, eggs, and bacon breakfast. The service was good, the atmosphere is super bright and open, and it's definitely a good place to go with a group of friends.
