Little Goat Diner////So I finally tried little goat again after a year because I've had pretty awful previous experiences. Previously the food has just been ok and the service was awful and slow. They also messed up the bill and charged my card triple what it should have been! Not only that, but I had to call them 10 times over 3 months for them to correct the error. The management office never returned my calls and when I finally got a hold of them, they were not even apologetic! Â Hopefully they have since changed their management.
