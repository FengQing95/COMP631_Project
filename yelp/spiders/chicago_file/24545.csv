Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Disclaimer:  I'm not from Chicago.  But I wasn't that impressed with the deep dish pizza here.  I ordered the calamari and a small "Lou" deep dish, which had tomatoes, spinach and mushrooms on it.  Sat at the bar and had a couple Bud Lights.  Service was impeccable.  The bartender was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive.  The calamari was good, too.  But the dipping sauce was basically ketchup mixed with salsa.  The deep dish had absolutely no flavor whatsoever.  Needed more salt in the crust.  But it seemed homemade and authentic, for what it's worth.  Atmosphere was awesome, though.  Lot of people laughing and sharing a good time.  Oh; and they have Malort - so be a local and take a shot.  Afterall, those pants won't shit themselves!  Would recommend to any other tourists in the area for an easy, friendly, authentic, casual dining spot in downtown Chicago.
