Little Goat Diner////I had noted in one of my earlier reviews that I had originally planned to visit a few months ago; I didn't anticipate waiting an hour and half to get a table. Would it have been worth the wait at the time? I'd have to try the rest of the menu to figure that out. Still, I feel like I may be playing a bit of favoritism by not saying anything bad about that fact.
