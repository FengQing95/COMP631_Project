Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is definitely my favorite restaurant in the city! It's always busy with a great atmosphere and most importantly the food is always delicious. My regular dishes are the spicy potatoes, calamari, burrata and goats cheese in tomato sauce. Be sure to make a reservation here for weekend evenings - it's usually booked up 2 weeks in advance.
