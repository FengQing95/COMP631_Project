Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////It has been YEARS since I've had tapas this good, since I was in Spain to be exact. Everything we've had has been delicious. Bacon wrapped dates are to die for and would probably kill me if I had less self control. The sangria is fantastic to wash it all down. In case you haven't noticed, the food if phenomenal here. Our server, Carly, was on top of everything and gave some nice suggestions.
