Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Yes its crowded, yes it's popular, yes you always have to wait but in my mind it is so worth it.  Whenever I have friends in town, we go there- it's great for a group - get a couple pitchers of the tasty Sangria and you can order a couple small plates at the bar if you can't wait.  There are so many tapas places in the city now but after trying them, I always want to come back to BaBaReeba.  Oh- and I really don't think it is pricey, compared to some other tapas spots in town.
