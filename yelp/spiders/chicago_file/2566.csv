The Purple Pig////Great place to eat! I highly recommend their salt-roasted beets. It's topped with goat cheese and pistachios, which is an oddly satisfying combination. However, the food is on the salty side. Probably great with a glass of wine, but for a party that doesn't drink, we definitely needed to refill our glasses of water a few times more than usual. But otherwise, the food was delicious and the environment was pretty chill (I was there on a Monday afternoon so not sure about how it is on the weekends). Definitely a go to while exploring the city of Chicago ;)
