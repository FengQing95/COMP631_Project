Art Institute of Chicago////We loved the way this museum was set up. All the staff were beyond knowledgeable and helpful. We had a very short time frame and their brochure was very helpful as it had a guide to their top pieces. We were able to see a lot of them within a hour but I wish I had so much more time to just appreciate it all. It was still amazing being able to see so many iconic pieces. I would highly suggest going even if just for a small visit because seeing works of art in person is very special and unlike a lot of experiences. I also highly suggest getting the city pass because you save a lot of money and it's one of many incredible stops.
