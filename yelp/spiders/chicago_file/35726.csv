Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We arrived and unfortunately were having a bad experience so far, and we had only been in the city about 4 hours ; that all turned around as soon as we met our server Amie. Not only was she extremely attentive throughout the whole meal, but also offered suggestions (sides are at least medium portions, and 2 of them was more than enough to split between the 2 of us.)
