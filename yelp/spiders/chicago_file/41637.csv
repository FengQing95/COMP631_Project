Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of my favorites in Chicago! The food here is always exellent and it has a great atmopsphere. Best tapas restaurant in the city by far. The chorizos are awesome, the patatas bravas are always great, the empanadas are top notch, etc etc. I have never been dissapointed with a meal here.
