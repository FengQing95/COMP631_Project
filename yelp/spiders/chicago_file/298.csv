Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The corned beef benedict was the absolute hands down best I've had in years, 5 stars without a doubt.   However the coffee, or what they called a cappuccino and a latte were absolutely horrendous.  Unfortunate since they advertise Intelligentsia coffee.  But if you go for food and only that, not bad.  Not bad at all
