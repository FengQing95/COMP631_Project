The Purple Pig////Every tapas place is unique and I tend to find at least a few of my plates to be enjoyable. The Purple Pig lived up to the reviews, but I've had tapas that was just as good and unique in the 'burbs for less. Having said that, however, the location is half the fun + you get solid food delivered by knowledgeable waiters/waitresses!
