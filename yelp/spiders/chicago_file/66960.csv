Little Goat Diner////The waiter was friendly and enthusiastic. He suggested the crumpets, which he called the hidden gem of the menu. They were okay. I would have liked it better as a half-order (which is not an option) and some fruit or something, because 12 hours later I still felt like I ate cement that was still stuck in my belly. I get the greasy-spoon thing, but I don't like my breakfast to make me feel like crap for the whole day.
