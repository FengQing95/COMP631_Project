Little Goat Diner////One companion ordered the "Kimchee & Bacon & Eggs & Pancakes Asian-Style Breakfast Tasty Thing", of which the bacon, eggs, pancakes, and (especially) kimchee were pretty mediocre; which was only "Asian-Style" by virtue of said mediocre kimchee and an absolutely terribly-executed sauce that was thin and ill-suited for the dish, and that she (generously) described as "some dumb Thai-style thing";  and which, frankly, wasn't tasty but I guess could be accurately delineated a "thing."  The other ordered the "Parathas Burrito," which appeared to me and was reported to be a bit of a weak, flat, uninteresting, and ultimately poorly-conceived and not-very-tasty mess (yet at least less not-very-tasty than the aforementioned and inaptly named "Tasty Thing").  The goat-burger, which I ordered Korean-style, was fairly good -- though largely on the strength of the Kilgus-Farmstead-sourced meat and the novelty of eating goat in burger-form, and not on account of any brilliance of composition or consummation.
