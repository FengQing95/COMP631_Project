Little Goat Diner////Ugh Little Goat, I wanted to love you so much. My friend and I split the grilled cheese, some other un memorable sandwich, the mac and cheese and the onion rings and pickles. The onion rings were the best thing. The grilled cheese was so bad, it had greens in it and the cheese they used made it taste bitter. How do u mess up a grilled cheese! Im also a mac n cheese snob and this just had no flavor. I would go back but my friend who I went with recently went back and said it was equally as disappointing. Oh well I guess Ill just have to wait 3 months to get a reservation at girl and goat because that is really delic!
