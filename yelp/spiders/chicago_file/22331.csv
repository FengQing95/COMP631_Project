Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Good service and good food every single time. I've been here twice, once for pick up and once with a party of 6. We were happy every time. Reason for the 4 stars is the ambiance can be a bit cramped. I was not as comfortable as I would be at a different Lou's location. Other than that, highly recommended you're in River North.
