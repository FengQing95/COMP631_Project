Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Just went there tonight and felt the need to write this review right away. This place deserves the best reviews, the best words! this was a post graduation dinner with my parents that came all the way from France. I was a little afraid since they are picky eaters. They took the Steak frites and I took the filet mignon. Best meat I've ever eaten, sooo good! More I picked the cheapest white wine I found on the card and I loved it ( just couldn't recall the name but it was very sweet, the way i like). For dessert, I took the chocolate pie but couldn't finish it (no waste, I took it home :) ) my parents took the lemon pie and my mom said it was the best she has eaten ( not to mention, my mom is the pickiest person I know Â when it comes for eating). Also, extra note for the service, just perfect. Our main server was such a nice person, all smiling, very patient because my parents don't speak much english and He even said goodbye in French to them. My dear server, hope If i come back, we will see each other again, you are such sweetheart.
