Art Institute of Chicago////All in all, I really enjoyed our visit to the Art Institute. The building is gorgeous, modern, and bright, a stunning backdrop to the works of art scattered within. There was a nice selection of things to view, a good variety of periods and artists and countries, and a few truly stunning, standout works. I also liked the little cafe on the second floor, where we were able to gulp down a mediocre but VERY welcome cup of coffee.
