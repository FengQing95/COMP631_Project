Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Absolutely delicious. This is the best (classy) dinner I've had in Chicago. Though it is dark AF inside, the atmosphere is very old-school cool. A reservation is totally needed, I do believe they offer couches on the main and lower levels that are first-come, first-serve, but I've never seen these open. Big fan of their corkage fee- you can bring your own bottle of wine, and all they ask is that you share a glass with another table in the restaurant. BAVETTE'S, Y U SO CUTE?
