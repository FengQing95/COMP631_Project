Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This was my favorite paella anywhere anytime.  GREAT flavor.   The Tapa's were plentiful, more options than most tapa places and very economically priced and delicious.   Their Sangria is more wine than sweet so better than most also.  HIGHLY recommend for anyone looking for Spanish food.
