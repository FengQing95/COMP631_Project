Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Yay for gluten free Chicago pizza!! Not true Chicago pizza as it's not deep dish...but the crust was amazing!!! Definitely one of the best gf crusts I've had...and I've tried a lot (Celiac). Also, reading other people's reviews about the regular "buttercrust" makes me think they try to make their gf crust the same. It was very buttery and delicious. Not too thin or cracker-like. I didn't feel cheated at all Â about not being able to eat the authentic Chicago pizza. FYI the gluten free pizza comes with just cheese so you need to add toppings if you want meat, etc. I got it with sausage, and it was perfect.
