Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I really loved this place! This was my and my husband's first tapas experience, so neither of us really knew how it worked or what dishes to order. We asked a lot of questions, and our waitress, Natalia, was so knowledgeable! She was able to describe every dish and make suggestions based off of what we told her we liked. Everything we ate tasted so good! I ate so much! We were there for two hours, and it was such a fun dining/entertainment experience!
