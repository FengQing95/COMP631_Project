The Purple Pig////This made for a stressful experience for everyone involved. The event turned into a race to sit down and order. Halfway through dinner, the waiter let us know we would be fine to continue ordering past 10pm. The host sat on his phone while we ate, and looked as if he was ready to clock out at a moment's notice. The food was great, and all it took was one person to turn an important milestone into a negative experience. The next time we make it to Chicago, we will not be visiting The Purple Pig. The front of house staff is a position management should not overlook or take for granted.
