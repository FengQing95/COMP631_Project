Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For 6:00 on a Friday, I was SHOCKED that our wait was only about 20 minutes. This location is a bit smaller than what I'm used to, but they use their space well and have a really efficient wait system. It uses modern technology (an iPad and texting) and they encourage you to order your pizza(s) while you wait so it cuts your wait time in half once you get to the table. Very efficient. Loved it.
