Smoque BBQ////AND THE MEATS... the meats are so succulent, all of them!  I love that I can get a "taste of _______," because even though I didn't want to focus on Texas sausage, I knew I needed to mix it up a little bit.  The pulled pork is outstanding, the meat slips right off the ribs, and the chicken was soooo moist and tasty.
