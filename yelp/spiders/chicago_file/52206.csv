Smoque BBQ////It's been a while since I've been here, but I distinctly remember being sort of unimpressed. Don't get me wrong, it's totally fine barbecue, but it has nothing on REAL SOUTHERN STUFF. Also between the meat and the sauce, the sauce is the clear winner. The meat just doesn't fall off the bones the way you'd want it to. It's almost there, but no cigar.
