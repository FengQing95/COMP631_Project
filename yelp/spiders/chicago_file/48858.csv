Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I don't care what some people say. I love this place. You think it's overpriced? I've been to tapas places that are way pricier, serve worse food, and offer less to choose from on their menu. True, it tends to be overcrowded, but this place is huge and has tons of seating, so as long as you go a little past prime dinner time, or go on a weeknight, you won't have to wait very long.
