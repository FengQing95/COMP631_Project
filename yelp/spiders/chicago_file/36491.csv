Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is a great place for dinner. It's a different ambience from most of the trendy places in River North.  It's got that vintage 1940's feel.  If you revisit a menu from a fine dining restaurant of a bygone era, it will look eerily like Bavette's menu and ambience.  The food is good.  It really is, but you won't walk away thinking to yourself "WOW!!!" except when you look at your bill.
