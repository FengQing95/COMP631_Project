Little Goat Diner////There were quite a few times when I asked Caroline for another napkin, she pointed me to a napkin holder of small, square napkins rather than providing a replacement for my lap. We had to ask Caroline for a refill for our water carafe and later a refill for my iced tea, which would have been a beer had Caroline informed they had alcohol when I asked what beverages were offered. Caroline told me the types of fountain sodas only. To my surprise, I saw beer, wine and even milkshakes being served.
