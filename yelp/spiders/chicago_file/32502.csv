Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Had to try deep dish when in Chicago and thoroughly enjoyed the personal sized sausage basil pizza from Lou Malnati's. We came in around midnight on a Saturday evening after catching a jazz show nearby, glad they are open late. Everything's baked fresh and nothing is pre made so be prepared to wait. We were told that it would take 25 mins for our fairly easy order to be ready but we didn't mind that. The sauce was so tasty and fresh and the crust itself had so much flavor. Service was excellent even though they were close to wrapping up for the day.
