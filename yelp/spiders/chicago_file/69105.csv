Little Goat Diner////Will I go back? Most likely, no..... the wait to get in was too long, the wait once we were in was too long and the wait to get our pancakes was... a wait. The drinks were horribly overpriced ($9 for a beer that you can easily get for $6 elsewhere in the city), but the food is probably worth a visit if you live in the area.
