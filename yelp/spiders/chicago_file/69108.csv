Little Goat Diner////Food: Went with my friend recently and I decided to be adventurous and ordered little piggy went to China. It was OK! I can finish any breakfast/brunch food but I struggled with this one. I am all about different flavors, but this one just didn't hit the spot. The first two bites seemed really good, but then felt a very strong tangy flavor with excess sesame take over my tongue. Also the chai was OK.
