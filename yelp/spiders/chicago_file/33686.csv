Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Been to all the nice steak houses in Chicago, except for this one. Worth the wait, I ate here last night. Still can't stop thinking about the meal. Best Caesar salad in the city, they add smoked trout which is insanely good. I ordered a bone in filet medium and half way through it got really rare. It was so good though. I mention it to the waiter and he sent a manager. Jay or Jason I forget, takes it off my bill. I only mentioned it cause my meal was damn near perfect. Thank you to management. I felt a little embarrassed by it. Great ambience also. Nice crowd.
