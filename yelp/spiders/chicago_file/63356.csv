Smoque BBQ////I'm old enough to remember Bones Resturant in Lincolnwood, and how the meat would be smoked and tender enough to fall of the bone, this was BBQ heaven for me. I even remember when Bones had a small fire and all my classmates were wondering if this would be the end of our favorite BBQ place. I shed a tear when they closed Bones for LWoods.
