Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Atmosphere in the restaurant was OK, but I felt it was a little bright.  The walls are filled with pictures and memorabilia so you have a distraction while you wait for your food.  One of my personal pet peeves was evident here as the restaurant was a little slow to start and the servers were standing at the service station doing crossword puzzles and griping about the seating rotation of the hostesses.  There was no manager evident until we were done with our meal, and this would have been his issue to deal with.
