Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Sourdough Bread- I know, it's odd that I'm reviewing the free bread they serve at every table, but I just had to give it a little shoutout because it was delicious. Â I love sourdough bread, and their's was warm with a thick crust on the outside and soft pillowy goodness on the inside.
