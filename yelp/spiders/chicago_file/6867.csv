Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute is absolutely marvelous. Hands-down one of my favorite museums not just for its grandeur, but for its beautiful collections, friendly and attentive staff, its organization and just the consistently wonderful time I have every time I get a chance to visit. I'm not a local, just a frequent visitor so I usually hop on a bus from a hotel downtown or take a train to a bus. So I can't really say much for the parking situation. Whenever I go, I try to pair it or combine it into a group deal with other museums/sites around the city so that I can the best bang for my buck (like Go-Pass or City Pass). Especially in the summer, there is usually a pretty long line for museum-goers early in the morning when the museum opens. You'll definitely need to allot a few hours to at least walk-thru most of it. Definitely check out the Van Goghs and all the Impressionism art. Check out Warhol's Mao! It's a favorite of mine as well as anything by Magritte. And of course Seurat's Sunday in the Park is a must-see. There is just so much to see that it can be quite overwhelming. The hardest part is coming to grips with realizing you won't see everything and be able to spend the right amount of time with each piece of work. After you accept that and accept the fact that you WILL come back soon, the entire experience is fabulous!
