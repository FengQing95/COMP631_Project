Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Meh, I've experienced better really nails it. Blah! I mean really! Very disappointed considering so many people think it's THE place to go for deep dish. My guess is that it has lost its mojo since it now seems so touristy. The place was packed for lunch when we got there and we were told that the pizza would take 45 minutes. We were 4 adults and two children and they say us in a round table which barely fit all of us, we were knocking elbows. To top it off it was in the middle of the dining room close to the stairs and the kitchen exit. Extremely uncomfortable!
