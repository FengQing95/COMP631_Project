Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The service is always good, and very attentive. This restaurant is popular though! So expect it to always be busy and a little loud. Many people come here for special occasions because they can accommodate larger groups and the atmosphere is lively. You can make a reservation ahead of time on Opentable, or try your luck just walking in. Either way, make sure to check out this awesome eatery!
