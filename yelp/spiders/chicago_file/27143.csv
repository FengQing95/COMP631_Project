Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is the best deep dish I've ever had. Given I'm a straight up tourist and have only had one or 2 slices of Chicago Deep Dish in Chicago, the crust was buttery and crispy but not dry near the sauce. The tomatoes were fresh and and sausage was delicious. It was super filling and I was barely able to eat half of a personal size one. Somehow after I brought 2 larger ones home I was able to eat more than half of that after baking it at home. The frozen pizzas survived a couple hours to the airport and a 4 hour plane ride, and the hour long drive home. I popped that baby right in the oven as soon as I put my stuff down...and even the frozen version was amazing
