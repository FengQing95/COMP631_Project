Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////A nice brunch place in downtown Chicago. The place is pretty big and service is basically a small army. They have a lot to choose from so I was pretty torn. In the end I opted for the Corned Beef Hanny Benedict. The food here was really good and their homemade jam is also very tasty. Portions are not small here at all and seem to not care what most dishes are paired with. For example, my dish was basically corned beef hash on top of an english muffin with a poached egg. That came with more hash browns as well. A lot of taters if you ask me. I could've opted for the side of fruit but yeah.. I didnt.
