Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////There are so many tapas to choose from, but our favorites include the dates wrapped in bacon, spicy potatoes, and the buttermilk fried chicken thighs with peri-peri sauce. The chicken paella is fantastic as well, it is definitely worth trying at least once! We prefer to get a bunch of tapas, but whatever suits you!The white peach sangria is also heavenly!
