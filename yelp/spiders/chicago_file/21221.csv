Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Host was a totally rude person that had an extremely bad attitude and cursed out customers while walking away from their table. This and the fact that it took FOREVER to get your pizza even after you pre order was the reason why I gave it 4 stars. It would had been 3 stars but honestly, the food is pretty freakin amazing.
