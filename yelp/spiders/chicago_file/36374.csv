Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Okay so I'll tell you what you really want to know:  the food at Bavette's is AMAZING.  That may be a trite descriptor, but trust me it's accurate.  I started with the Lillet Rose martini, made with St. Germain, vodka, and lillet rose.  It was light, fruity and refreshing - a positive start to the meal!
