Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I would rate Bavette's good but not great.  I was really wanting to love this place from what I've heard, but the Classice Ribeye was just so-so.  I love ribeye, and wanted to love Bavette's but I can clearly say that the Ribeye I had a RPM, David Burke's, and even Ruth's Chris was clearly better.  The steak was tender as a ribeye should be, but it was really missing a great sear on the exterior.  The roasted chicken was also just so-so.
