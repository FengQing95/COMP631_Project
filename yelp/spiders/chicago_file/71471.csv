Little Goat Diner////Overall I would say the menu has a lot going on.  Perhaps a true "foodie" would be more excited, but I will say if you are dining with kids that they may likely be put off by some of the items as there are a lot of extra ingredients/condiments in some of the traditional sounding offerings like the grilled cheese and veggie quesadilla.  Unfortunately, dinner service took so long (for just one course) that we did not have time to try out some of the desserts or shakes even though we had allotted an hour and a half for dinner.
