Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I visit Chicago fairly often but do not understand why I never gave this place a try.  It turned out to be the best deep dish I've had in Chicago.  Buttery crust,  adequate amount of cheese,  and just enough sauce made it impossible to put away.  I recommend this place to everyone if they want to have the best deep dish in town!
