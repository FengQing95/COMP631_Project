Little Goat Diner////Since I'm allergic to shrimp, I delicately ate my way around the shrimp and pork belly salad. All of the veggies were fresh. This was a simple, light, and refreshing salad. Definitely healthy. The blue plate special for the night was also fresh and healthy. The sockeye salmon was rich in flavor and the vegetable medley worked well together. On the downside, it wasn't filling, but at least I know I was eating smart. I'd order it again.
