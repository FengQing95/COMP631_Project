Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Sodikoff, as I've said in previous reviews, is a genius. Each of his Chicago restaurants are consistently outstanding, which is why I constantly find myself recommending them to everyone I know. It's truly a testament to him that he's found a way to grow his empire to this extent without copying the same concepts over and over again.
