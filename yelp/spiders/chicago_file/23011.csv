Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visiting from Phoenix on a business/pleasure trip. Asked some trusted resources where to go for the best Chicago pizza. I remember the original Uno's and Due's from visiting as a kid from St. Louis and figured those names would pop up. 2 people recommended Lou Malnati's. Suddenly I remembered that name too. Couldn't wait to try it. It's a chilly 46 degree day and it was a long 12-15 block walk from the hotel. Â What did we find?
