Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Although I loved the atmosphere, the octopus and scallop tapas, I was very disappointed with the lobster paella. The presentation was beautiful, but the lobster was on the dry side and a little chewy, and the rice in the paella was hard and overall on the greasy side. I took two bites of it and that was about it. My friend that was with me that travels to Spain every year, agreed that the rice was hard. We also expected the lobster to be in the paella and not served in the shell. Our server was fantastic, however, I was a little disappointed that the manager didn't come to our table after we let our server know how we felt. I will give this place another shot and perhaps try different tapas. The sangria was quite nice.
