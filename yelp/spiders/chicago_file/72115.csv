Little Goat Diner////I've been to Little Goat 3 times now and have loved it each time. I love the quirky old school, yet modern diner feel of Little Goat. I was here dining on Monday for one of my gf's birthdays. Â First, our waitress could't be any nicer (shout out to said waitress whose name escapes me at the moment).
