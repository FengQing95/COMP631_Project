Little Goat Diner////That said, if I could give the hostess negative stars I would. After waiting 45 minutes for a table(it was Sunday at 10am I get that we would have to wait) we were called up to the host desk to get our table. Being starved and in need of more coffee we were excited to be seated. Then we waited, and waited, and waited. I finally asked what the hold up was and was told they were clearing tables. I said ok and proceeded to wait more. I noticed a fully bused table and asked the hostess if that was our table, she said no, the one next to it that still needed to be bussed was. (Quick sidenote as a hostess I was often expected to bus tables and grab waters and coffee for customers if we were slammed so I wondered why none of the hostesses were helping out the staff) I explained that my friend was catching a flight to Atlanta and could we just have that one. she shouted at me "No you can just wait another 30 seconds until your table is ready!" Whoa. Um ok. I would have happily continued waiting at the little coffee bar in the next room where I was but you paged me up here 5 minutes ago to "seat" me. I was stunned. A- because I was trying to be polite and B- because really who speaks to a customer that way in front of a crowd of other customers. My friends and I were totally stunned. Then she stormed off to the kitchen and came back with a busser/server and we were seated. Another busser who brought our plates and specifically said to me "This one is your plate" um ok. My friend made a comment that the hostess must have ordered a plate with something "special" on it for me. I laughed but was unsettled and didn't eat off that plate. I felt really awkward for the rest of the meal.
