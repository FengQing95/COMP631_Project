Art Institute of Chicago////I've visited tens of museums nationally and internationally- including some of the best in the world (MMA, LACMA, Prado, Uffizi, Accademia). This was the best. Amazing collection. Room full of Monets. Several Van Goghs. Huge rooms of Byzantine, Modern, Greeks, Asian, Central Asian, Hellenic, Modern art.
