The Purple Pig////Walked by here 3 days in a row during my recent stay in Chicago for a conference and was discouraged by the line. But then I got smart lol 11:40am on Saturday I stood in that line for their 12pm open and knew that everyone in line ahead of me was gonna get seated at 12 so the line wasn't bad at all!
