Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is what the best deep dish pizza looks like.  Be sure to get low fat cheese - it makes NO DIFFERENCE in taste.  Also - have them take the extra 10 mins to cook the pizza well done.  It makes it a little more crunchy on the bottom and a little more refined on the palate.  When I come back to Chicago - THIS is my first place I wanna go.
