Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Service was standard and attentive. Everyone was pleasant. At the end of the day, I'm rating this fairly low for my steak, but hope to make it back and give it another shot. That said, for a place that hangs its reputation on steaks, they let me down in a big (and fairly expensive) way.
