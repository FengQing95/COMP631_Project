Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Awesome food and service! Delicious tapas and our Rioja Spanish wine bottles were well worth the price!! Our amazing waitress, Samantha made our evening even more special. She was extremely courteous and professional!! As an event planner for a major Fortune 500 corporation, I acknowledge great service we you receive it! Â If in Lincoln Park, it's a must!!
