Smoque BBQ////This is my go to spot when it comes to BBQ. as good as you're going to get in terms of BBQ with balance. Balance. Not BBQ that's drenched in BBQ sauce to hide the lack of quality in the meat. If that's your type of BBQ then this place is not for you and I'm sorry. Balanced BBQ, low and slow, which is the rub, spice, smoke, the quality of meat, and the sauce. Everything in their menu here is exceptional to damn near perfection. Pulled pork, awesome. Ribs, full of flavor and fresh fall of the bone. Chicken is great as well. Texas Sausage had a nice little kick. Their sides all deliver as well, especially their brisket chili, bbq beans, fresh cut fries, and the cole slaw. But the brisket is the best in the city and from what I hear, better than some areas in Texas. How is that possible? Lol just make you're next trip to Smoque if you're craving BBQ. Not a true restaurant though, it's a order and pickup your food on a tray and sit down.  But it's worth it if you're a restaurant-savvy type of eater. The staff is friendly and will help you find a seat for you and your party.  Cafeteria style seating(patio is more restaurant style seating), fountain soft drinks with free refills, bottle drinks and BYOB. Enjoy!
