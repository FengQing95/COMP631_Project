The Purple Pig////The advantage of having a group of six was that we got to try all kinds of things at Purple Pig. Besides the famous pork shoulder and pork marrow, we also tried pork chops, pork sandwich, sausages plus cheese, etc.. As we also spotted that every table ordered the cornbread, we also went ahead with one to share. Indeed, you would not be disappointed by this cornbread: very soft and creamy, with an extra flavor of honey in it. It opened up your appetite right away. Different from most of the reviews, I am not too keen about their pork shoulder and marrow. The pork shoulder was indeed very well-cooked and soft. However, the natural flavor of the pork was completely overshadowed by the creamy stew/sauce on top of it. You got quite stuffed by the creaminess. At the same time, the pork marrow was actually something I felt worth trying, in other words, a tourist dish. The marrow itself was flavorless. With the bread and salt, you started to feel the fine texture of the marrow and it tasted mostly like a light butter. While it is for sure worth tasting, I didn't find anything in particular that would make this dish popular with non-first-time customers. The presence of all the dishes was great, very well-decorated with colorful sauces and small nuts and vegetables.
