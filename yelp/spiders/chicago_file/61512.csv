Smoque BBQ////Everything was delicious!  Right down to the mountain of fries, the cole slaw and the sauce.  The wait from a line to the door to placing our order was probably about 12 minutes.  We then waited maybe another 8 minutes for our food.  Excellent efficiency for a restaurant that was absolutely packed.
