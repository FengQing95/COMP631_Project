Little Goat Diner////My husband and I have eaten at Little Goat many times and have loved the food for years.  When we were deciding on a wedding reception venue Little Goat was on our list of places to check out.  We had planned for a very small guest list so places like LG and Girl and The Goat fit the bill.  I initially inquired about dates of availability and prices and got info right away.  We were able to schedule a visit with ease and went to see both spots at the same time, ultimately picking LG because... well that terrace, man! How can you not love it! Plus the space is super intimate and they cook everything right in front of you.  My one "must have" for the day was to be able to eat dinner at one table together (we ended up with two which was still perfect) and really be able to talk, hang out, and have fun.
