Smoque BBQ////Smoque is great BBQ! Loved the ribs and the brisket is to die for. One of the best things about Smoque is everything comes out hot and fresh! I think BBQ must be smoked meats and this is one hell of a smoked meat palace. A little pricey, expect to pay 30 per person, also there are long lines to get seated on weekends.....expect to wait 30-45 minutes for a table. Otherwise this is some smokin great BBQ!
