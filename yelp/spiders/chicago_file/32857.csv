Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great great great steak. If you are going to get a steak here get the dry aged rib eye. It is a few dollars more than the regular rib eye and it is worth it. The cocktails are excellent some of the best I have had in Chicago. Nice atmosphere and great wait staff and friendly hostess. Cant think of a single negative.
