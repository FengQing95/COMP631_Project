Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////One day I'll come and update with a review about the steak or something else that's probably amazing here. For now, I shall rave about the short rib stroganoff. Buttery, perfectly seasoned, not super salty, little nuggets of beef heaven, mushrooms, and somehow the noodles are perfect every time. Big portion so you can also enjoy another meal. Also the mushrooms as a side great. There's also that avocado crab salad. I mean. Perfectly layered lettuce, lightly dressed, generous helping of delicious crab. Salted butter with the sourdough which is perfectly warm. I prefer just nibbling on the crust with the butter while I await the stroganoff. Carrot cake yum! Great wine list. House red is delicious. The bourbons and whiskey you need. Last but not least, great service from the moment you walk into the foyer to the bar to a table. Icing on the cake is that the restaurant itself is lovely, chicago Parisian dark and light comfortable fancy yet casual and comfortable. Lively but not annoying. A little quieter in the downstairs bar area but just as awesome!
