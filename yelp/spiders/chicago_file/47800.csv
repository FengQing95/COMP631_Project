Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Unfortunately we didn't start off well since we waited 40 minutes to be seated even though we had a reservation. We weren't seated until my husband went and inquired about it to the host and apparently they had overlooked our names and were seating people with 8:45 reservations even though ours was at 8:00. We were not feeling optimistic to start. One of the managers working there stopped by once we were seated to apologize and in fact bought our pitcher of sangria, which was so nice that all was forgiven.
