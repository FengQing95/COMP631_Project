Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////First came here in early 2015, then again in late 2015. Haven't been back since but definitely wanted to write this review because I want to return soon! The decor is very vintage-y, and inside is dimly lit. Staff and waiters are all extremely kind and attentive, but not intrusive.
