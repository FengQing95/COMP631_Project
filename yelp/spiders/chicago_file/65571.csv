Smoque BBQ////Ate on their covid patio on a Sunday afternoon. Surprisingly wasn't very busy. Baby Back Ribs were absolutely delicious, tender and with great crust. The two sauces were tasty and the beans were awesome. Mac and cheese was very creamy and good, but a tiny portion. Cornbread was great as well. The only negative to me was the brisket, it had a great smoke ring, but was fairly dry. Overall a great place for bbq
