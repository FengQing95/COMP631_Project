Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////For dessert, my friend and I got the butterscotch custard and the vanilla bourbon chai ice cream. 10/10 would recommend the ice cream--I loved how the flavors of the bourbon and chai combined. There was a nice balance between the two, allowing the bourbon to dominate but not overpower the chai and vanilla flavors. The ice cream also came with a fig cookie on the side, which I wasn't a huge fan--the ice cream was definitely the star of the dish, and I found the cookie a bit out of place. I also enjoyed the butterscotch custard, which had a very nice, strong butterscotch flavor, but after a while I found it a bit too sweet for me.
