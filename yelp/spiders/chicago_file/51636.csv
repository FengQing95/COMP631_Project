Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Definitely a fan. This place is good for a romantic dinner for two or a group setting. The share plates are amazing and the flavors are spot on. I know they are share plates for tapas but some of the potions are kind of sad in comparison to the price point. The goat cheese is amazing, the shrimp, the paella, ohh and the octopus. It is usually really hard for some places to make octopus the right way however all of the times that I've order it, it has been perfect.
