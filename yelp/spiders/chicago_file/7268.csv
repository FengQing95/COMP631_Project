Art Institute of Chicago////What a beautiful museum! It's definitely on my top 3 museums. The place is massive. I can easily spend an entire day admiring every art piece. I'm particularly impresssed with the Impressionism collection which is my ultimate favorite art movement. I had no idea they had so many Impressionist artworks! They also have an interesting and beautiful collection of American art which I was not very familiar with but definitely sparked my interest. It was $23 to enter for non-IL residents like myself but it was definitely a money well-spent. I left the museum a very happy girl!
