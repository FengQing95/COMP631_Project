Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First taste of Chicago style pizza. Prices are high. Did not Deliver to the room. Had to go to the lobby to pick it up, not sure if that is common in Chicago. I mistakenly tipped the delivery man.  For two waters and this pizza plus tip I paid $50. I would of been more satisfied with Pizza Hut. I also had Added mushrooms to  the pizza. There is a sprinkling of mushroom on it. Pizza was mediocre taste. Really what else is there to say. As far as delivery goes don't do it. Price is high for the taste. I am sure there has got to be better. Not a good diet cheat meal.
