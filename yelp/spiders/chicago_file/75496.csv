Little Goat Diner////Our server Melissa was SOOOO sweet, helpful, and shy. We liked her. She was dressed like all of the other female servers in cute royal purple dresses with black aprons. There were a LOT of employees: servers, bus people, and hosts. I think some of the employees were managers or investors or something. After all, today is only their third day of being open!
