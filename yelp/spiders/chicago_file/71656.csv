Little Goat Diner////I've been here several times and usually love what I order, but there have been a few times where the food did not meet my expectations resulting in four stars. I've had a variety of breakfasts, lunches and side dishes and in my opinion the real stars are the side dishes. I've honestly considering skipping an entree and just ordering multiple sides. The tempura mashed potatoes are unlike anything I've ever had before and I constantly find myself craving them. I also recently tried the goat chili cheese fries which I loved. Individually all of the flavors are amazing but together they work so perfectly. It's also a great way for someone to try goat if they are a little hesitant. I also love their Mac N Cheese. The only side I've had that didn't blow me away was the mashed potatoes and gravy. They were good, but not even close to being a stand out like the other three sides previously mentioned (and I love mashed potatoes and gravy). For entrees, most of them were good (I actually don't know if I'd consider any of them great) but I did have one that I did not like that all. It was This Little Piggy Went to China which I ordered solely because of the rave reviews it received on Yelp. However, I was not a fan of the spices they use so the dish was not enjoyable in my opinion.
