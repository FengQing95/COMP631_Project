Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My girlfriends and I had a massage and meal night yesterday and decided to eat at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba on a whim. It was rainy out, we were on cloud nine from our massages and we where hungry. We each ordered three plates and one dessert each. We had a blast catching up and before we knew it, it was after 10 and the place was getting empty. True sign of a good time and great restaurant. Meals with desserts and drinks, you can easily have a great time for about $30/pp.
