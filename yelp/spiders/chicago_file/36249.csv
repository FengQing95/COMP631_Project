Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I can't imagine getting a better steak. I had a dry aged and it was ridiculously delicious. The sauce they put with it was delicious but completely unnecessary. We also got the thick cut bacon, which was awesome, and pomme frites that were tasty. It was way too much food but all so good.
