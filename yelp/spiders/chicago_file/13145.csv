Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////One minor complaint, the hostess on Wed was not very nice to us. For every table she led customers to, she'd lay out the menus in front of each place setting, but she simply tossed the 3 menus onto the center of the table for us. (No, the place was not busy since it was past the lunch hour rush.) She did, however, say "Have a good day" when we left.
