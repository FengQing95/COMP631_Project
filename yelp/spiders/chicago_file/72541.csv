Little Goat Diner////I had brunch here last Thursday to celebrate my birthday. The food was rich and the service was okay. We ordered the pork belly pancake, Rueben sandwich, fried pickles and onion rings, and the chocolate malt shake. The sandwich and pork belly pancake were good and we loved the shake. We didn't really like the fried pickles and onion rings.
