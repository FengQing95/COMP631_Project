Little Goat Diner////As a fan of Top Chef and winner Stephanie Izard I was excited to try her restaurant while in Chicago. I was not able to make it to The Girl and the Goat, but we did make it to Little Goat for lunch on a weekday. Since we were on vacation we were able to eat during none rush hours. As expected the service was excellent. We, while honestly this was mostly me, took a long time deciding what to order. The waiter was helpful and was knowledgeable about the menu. Little Goat mixes the classic dinner idea with modern cuisine in both décor and food. Which was why it took a long time to look over the menu as there were many interesting options that you will not find else where. They do have some more basic items in case you are with some one with less adventurous tastes. I would normally say boring, but even basic items seemed to be done well based on our observation of other tables.  And the food lived up to the hype. I tried the tempura mashed potatoes starter based on the other reviews. They were ridiculously good and unexpected. We also had the pork belly pancake and a pork sandwich. The sandwich was good, but very messy and due to the coleslaw did not hold up as leftovers. The pork belly was awesome, and did not make it to be leftovers as it was gone very quickly. The meat was a bit fatty, but in this case it worked.
