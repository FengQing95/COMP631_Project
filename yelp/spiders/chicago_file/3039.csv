The Purple Pig////Most plates are meant for sharing, and depending on how hungry you are, 2-3 plates per person is usually plenty.  This time my friend and I shared the butternut squash soup, the roasted cauliflower salad, the bone marrow and the chicken thigh kebabs.  Everything was amazing.  I'd say the chicken was probably the most outstanding dish.  I've honestly had about 1/2 the items on the menu here and never been disappointed. My only dilemma is being torn from ordering favourites from last time and trying something new.
