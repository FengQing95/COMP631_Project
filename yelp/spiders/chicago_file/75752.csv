Little Goat Diner////The food we ordered was a bit mixed.  The pork belly sandwich was very tasty.  This was the highlight of our meal. Chili cheese fries was made with a white cheese which set it apart from any id eaten before.  This wasn't bad but can't say I'd order it again. The fried shrimp appetizer was good and made with a strand like batter.  We also got a burger which was just average.
