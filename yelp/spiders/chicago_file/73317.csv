Little Goat Diner////The pancake was awesome--a savory scallion pancake with a well-prepared slice of pork belly and absolutely loaded with slaw. The great thing about the pork belly was that it properly walked the line between meaty and fatty. It really showed why pork belly can be so delicious when cooked properly. A quibble, if only a minor one, was that the pancake was a tad chewier than I would have liked.
