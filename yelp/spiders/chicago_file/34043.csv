Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////From the time we arrived to Bavette's (9PM) to the time we left (12AM), we were treated to an awesome, knowledgeable staff; unbelievable food and a truly unique ambiance.  The main floor decor is a mix between modern and 1930's Chicago.  As Ron Burgundy would say, "...it smelled of rich mahogany and leather-bound books."  It's classy and sexy.  I highly recommend dressing to impress at this place -- dudes, leave your going out shirt at home and do it up with a sport coat, even a suit is at home here.
