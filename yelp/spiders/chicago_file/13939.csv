Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza tasted awesome after the wait for a table (and another 35 minute wait for the food). But I'm fairly sure it was only that good because of how absurdly hungry I was. I'm not convinced this is Chicago's Best Deep Dish Pizza. It was certainly filling, and it's hard to screw up an inch-thick pile of cheese covered in sauce. The small size was just about right for two. The pizza had a pie-like, buttery crust, about an inch of mozerella, sauce and a layer of sausage. Despite looking impressive, it was surprisingly bland. Parmesean and pepper flakes were necessary to liven things up. The signed H.W. Bush Yale jersey they had on the wall next to us didn't help either.
