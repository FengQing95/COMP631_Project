Art Institute of Chicago////A must-visit site for any art-enthusiast visiting Chicago. They have one of the best collections of paintings I've seen and personally enjoyed seeing all of the Monet pieces in particular. I also didn't know they had the "Sunday afternoon on la Grande Jatte" painting here so imagine my surprise when I randomly stumbled across it here. There were many other iconic pieces and exhibits here and one can easily spend a few hours walking around trying to see it all. Definitely worth a visit and bring comfy walking shoes!
