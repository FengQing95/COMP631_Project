Little Goat Diner////We went here on a Tuesday morning for breakfast around 10am with luck of no wait time! I've heard so much about this place so I just had to come and try what they had to offer...This little piggy went to China was our favorite! Too bad they ran out of the Ooey gooey cinnabun...Although I prefer French toast over waffles, I liked the Fat Elvis waffles vs the Little goat Bulls eye French toast(which seems overrated) My brother tried the Biscuits and gravy which goes well on the smoked fries! My brother ordered the Honey yogurt & house granola which he says was OK. Service was good and prompt! Prices were reasonable for portion! Noise level was average...
