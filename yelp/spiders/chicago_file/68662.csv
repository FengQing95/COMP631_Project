Little Goat Diner////We went for my brother's birthday. Half of us liked our dishes, while the other half were unimpressed with price versus quality. I'm on the fence with my pork belly pancake sandwich. The hoisin pork was cooked perfectly, but the coleslaw was so bland that I had to add salt and pepper to it. (I did like the fact that the slaw had thinner strips than traditionally served. It gave a more even distribution over the pork.) However, the scallion pancake part was terrible. It wasn't anywhere near burnt, but it had this bitterly acrid aftertaste as if it had been. Maybe someone accidentally put too much baking powder in the mix that day? Regardless, it was inedible and I had to leave it completely. The wine glass serving was on the light side as well. The cake of the day was chocolate cake with peanut butter frosting. Probably the lightest whipped frosting that I have ever had with incredibly dense and rich cake. So the dessert was the only thing I couldn't complain about.
