Smoque BBQ//// Went there with a group of friends this past weekend who all left fans of this place. I highly recommend the brisket. I always get it and I'm always happy. Two of the guys got the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich, which is half pulled pork and half brisket. They both loved the sandwich. The mac and cheese at this place is pretty decent, but the baked beans are better.
