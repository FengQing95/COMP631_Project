Smoque BBQ////I had heard so much good about this place and it is generally reviewed as one of the best BBQ joints in the area. So I finally tried it and I was not disappointed. I had the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich. Both the pulled pork and the brisket were good. I have had better brisket before but the pulled pork was amazing. the mac n cheese side was some of the best mac n cheese I have had from a BBQ sot, and the cornbread was great. I am going to try a few more BBQ spots around here but Smoque is definitely the leader of the pack for my go to spot for BBQ.
