Little Goat Diner////Hm. Would I go back? Probably not. I'm sorry Little Goat, aesthetically I think you're a very cute diner, but the food was sub par. The staff? Very nice. Our server? Attentive, polite, funny. The atmosphere? Has this cool vibe like "am I at an upscale Denny's with hip music?" But I just keep going back to the food and it was just - meh. I did order a salad, which I guess isn't the best thing to order at a dinner, but still, it should be good, right? The shrimp on the salad wasn't good - didn't taste especially fresh and wasn't seasoned. I think the part that really threw me was the cheddar cheese shreds on a salad with shrimp... with peanuts. I did order one of the speciality drinks (can't remember the name ) and it was decent.
