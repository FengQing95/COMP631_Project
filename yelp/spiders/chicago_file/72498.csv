Little Goat Diner////I love this place and think it's a perfect lunch spot! I tend to visit here when the wait at the surrounding restaurants are ridiculous and we're always seated within 10 minutes. The menu uses a lot of interesting/tantalizing flavor combos (I may be biased bc of my love for kimchi).
