Little Goat Diner////We were all quite excited for our dinner at Little Goat as none of us had been there but had heard great things. We arrive and the evening starts well. The waitress seems nice and attentive and our drinks and starters arrive promptly and are quite good. The issue begins with the main course--all three of us ordered the fried chicken after asking for suggestions. I noticed that my chicken leg could have been cooked longer but the wing is cooked perfectly. It's not until I slice into my breast, which actually requires me to saw into the meat with my knife, that I suspect that this piece is more than just a little tough. When I part the meat, I see that it is pink which anyone who has ever cooked a chicken will know is not the proper color for a fully cooked breast (unless it has been barbecued but this, again, is fried chicken).
