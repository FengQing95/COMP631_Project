Smoque BBQ////OH yummy! Â I was there last night for a party with the chicago reader group. i have been wanting to try this place for some time. I am so glad I did. the Sandwhiches melt in your mouth! literally I am not kidding. the sauce is just amazing. I only wish we could have tried the cobbler. I forced myself to eat the entire plate and my best friends left overs. I did and I can say I am proud! ha ha. Dont miss this.
