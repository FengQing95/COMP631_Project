Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went here with a few girl friends right before Christmas time for brunch. The tapas here are really yummy and the sangria options are spectacular as well.  It's good to get a mix of savory and sweet tapas for the brunch and while the portions are not too big, it's exciting to be able to try the different options.  Their paella was good but I preferred the smaller tapas plates.
