Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Cocktails:  I tried all three of their old fashioned's and had a glass of white wine with the seafood (yes, I got a little carried away but whatever).  Let me put it out there that I'm an old fashioned connoisseur (of sorts) and I tend to judge a "mixologist" by how well they construct my cocktail of choice.  Let me tell you that these were some of the best I've ever had.  Period.
