Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Was walking around Lincoln Park looking for a place to eat with some friends and ended up trying this place on a whim, and I'm so glad we did! This place is great! The restaurant is huge and even on a Monday night was packed! We were only told a 10-15 minute wait which was great, but what was even better was that we ended up actually getting seated right away. The staff is super friendly and our waiter (I think his name was Daniel?) was awesome. He was so nice and really knowledgeable about the food, and they have a pretty extensive menu. One of the people I was with ended up not getting one of her plates, which wasn't a big deal, we just wanted to bring it to their attention so she wouldn't be charged for it. But he did us one better and actually took the item off the bill and also brought her the missing order to go! Great staff, environment and food! If you're in the area, definitely go!
