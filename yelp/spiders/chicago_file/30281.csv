Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My main issue is that we waited almost an hour during non-prime hours (3pm) only to receive a pizza that was cold.  Why were we waiting so long and starving when our pizza had clearly been sitting out and cooling off for quite a while? With all the cheese in this pizza, there was simply no way to really enjoy it at the temperature where the cheese has formed back into a solid hunk.
