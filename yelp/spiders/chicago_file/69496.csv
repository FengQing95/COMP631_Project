Little Goat Diner////Now, seeing that we did not get a proper breakfast on Sunday morning, we decided to hit up Little Goat again on Monday.  As it wasn't too busy, we were able to get seated right away on Monday.  Since we were also traveling on Monday, we had our suitcases with us.  the hostess kindly offered to let us keep them at the hostess stand while we dined, which I thought was a very nice touch.
