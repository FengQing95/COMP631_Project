Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Sangria at a steal and a variety of choices! It's easy to over-order here! My favorite dish was the bacon wrapped dates, followed by the steak. This is a true tapas place. We enjoyed our meal at a huge round table and chatted until close. I give a 4 on food, 3.5 on service, and. 3.5 on ambiance.
