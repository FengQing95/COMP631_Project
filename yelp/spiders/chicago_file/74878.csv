Little Goat Diner////The Reuben and the veggie quesadilla are two of my favorite dishes. My husband would be upset if I didn't mention the patty melt, as this is his go to. I have to admit, it is so juicy and flavorful. Portion size is big and I often leave feeling overly full. We have yet to order the goat burger, which is monstrous, Â but I plan to someday try and tackle it in a shared venture with someone else.
