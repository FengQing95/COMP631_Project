Little Goat Diner////I'm a fan. Everything done right. Host and server friendly enough. Fast seating even for a crowded Wednesday lunch. At first glance the prices may seem a little steep ($10-$13 for a sandwich), but the portion sizes are very Midwest and one "sammich" as its called on the menu along with the fries is just right for two people. The fries are "smokey" fries and they are really outstanding - thin cut with the skin and a distinctive smokey flavor. I had half a Fat Club sandwich and it was superior - ham, turkey, bacon, avocado, sauce, etc...
