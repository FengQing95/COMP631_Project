Little Goat Diner////Been here a few times, and each time is such a great experience.  The food is bombdotcom; I always order an order of the chili cheese fries (because it's honestly some of the best I've ever had), and another dish (yes, I am a fat ass).  The crab dip is also awesome--the richness of the dip, the buttery, flaky Ritz crackers..ugh.  Drooling just thinking about it.  The tiramisu milkshake made me a believer in milkshakes again.  Usually you get the same old flavors at many restaurants: chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, maybe a cookies n' cream thrown in there.  But at Little Goat?  They go above and beyond what any other restaurant would.
