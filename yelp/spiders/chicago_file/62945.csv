Smoque BBQ////Pretty damn good brisket sandwich and St. Louis ribs. Brisket was plentiful and was super tender and embraced by a square, soft and sweet dinner roll. Â The ribs was like "Wow...that's pretty smokey!" It was fall off the bone perfect. Also, I like that you get two kinds of sauces...I both liked them so I slathered my brisket with both sauces. Also, they have good customer service as they help to bring your tray, gather your utensils and offer to collect your trays after you finished my food.
