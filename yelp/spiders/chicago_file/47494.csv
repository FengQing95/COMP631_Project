Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Everybody rants and raves about this place and I don't seem to understand why. When I dined at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba (dined-in twice to confirm), the food presentation was sloppy, some of the warm plates were colder than expected, and the overall quality of the food was "meh". This place seems to have a cult following and advertises all over the city. If you live in Chicago, try it to say you tried it since one of your friends will eventually mention their "mind-blowing" experience at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba.
