Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I don't know if I would say their tapas is the best around, but this is a very popular place. As a result the wait on the weekend is always crazy,so if you're looking to do something quick I probably  avoid it then.  A favorite among the Lincoln Park Trixie's , always in full force and drunk off sangria. Just sayin.
