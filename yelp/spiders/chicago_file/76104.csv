Little Goat Diner////Food: In my trips here I've tried "This Little Piggy Went to China," the Bi Bim Bop Breakfast Bowl, the Shrimp Salad (from their summer menu I believe), the Chickpea Salad, the Bahn Mi style burger, their nachos, their broccoli, their Reuben, the "Goat Almighty," and their Smoked Pork & Toffee Crunch Shake. I particularly love their broccoli and Chickpea salad. I've never been disappointed with the flavors and quality of food, with my only complaint being that the salads and the breakfast bowls have, on occasion, been overdressed/overseasoned. Stephanie Izard is a genius at integrating and balancing flavors; you seriously can't go wrong with anything on the menu.
