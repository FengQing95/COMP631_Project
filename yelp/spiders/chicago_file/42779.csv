Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////When I have guests visiting from out of town I take them here. Not some pizza place, Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba. There are so many delicious places to visit in this city but I can rely on amazing food, a great atmosphere and fun memories when I take friends and family here. If its a Friday or Saturday night peek hours expect an hour+ wait. I like to grab the pintxos platter if anyone with me is unsure about a particular plate. A few standards for me that everyone seems to enjoy are Spicy Potatoes, Goat Cheese Baked Tomato and any empanada there. A favorite is the roasted dates wrapped in bacon. You can always order more and most times each plate comes out on its own so don't try and wait for everything before you start eating. And of course get a pitcher of sangria.
