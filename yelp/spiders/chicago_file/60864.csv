Smoque BBQ////But seriously, Smoque is a most unpretentious spot for quality made-with-love BBQ, friendly uncomplicated service, and mouth-watering food at a reasonable price. Hit it mid-afternoon like we did on a Friday and you can skip the usual "queueing up." We were served lique it was a fast food Â joint. Love the brisket and pulled pork. Have not tried the ribs yet. I also lique the casual college town ambience. The painted cinder block walls, the hard cement floor and the utilitarian hard-edged furniture. You can get Taque-out, and the place is BYOB, too.
