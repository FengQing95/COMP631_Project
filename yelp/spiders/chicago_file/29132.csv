Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My first deep dish in Chicago. Wow. I mean I'm from the real pizza capital of the US, New Haven, but Chicago deep dish is a whole different game. This isn't your chain pizza (at least across the rest of the states like Dominos, Pizza Hut, etc). It was a great atmosphere and place to eat a pie and watch the important sporting event of the day.
