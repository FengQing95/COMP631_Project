Art Institute of Chicago////Fabulous!! The museum is absolutely massive and a must see if you are in Chicago. It consists of three floors and multiple buildings of amazing art. There is a small cafe inside for a snack break. While there I got a mini ice cold Diet Coke and a small but delicious cheese plate for around $10. There is also a large gift shop on the main level with an large array of artsy gifts- books, jewelry, prints, etc. The price of admission varies according to the day you visit, if you are a resident of Chicago, and your age- senior or child, there are also student discounts available. Due to the size of the place I would recommend at least 3 hours to see everything!
