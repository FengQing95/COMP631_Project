Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The first time we came for breakfast, I was really impressed.  Service was great and fast, and the quality of food was impressive.  I had a Colorado omelet with hash browns, and it was done perfectly.  My son had oreo pancakes AND belgian waffles with apples, and he loved them.  My daughter had a Florence benedict and liked it, and my wife had the berry bliss pancakes and thought they were okay.
