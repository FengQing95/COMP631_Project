Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My steak frites, recommended au poivre, or topped with peppercorns in the classic French way, was served crisp on the outside as opposed to the usual, more liquid sauce. The fries were hot and firm, and the duck fat they were fried in gave them a very special flavor. The steak was of amazing flavor - but I had asked for the piece "medium rare," and had instead gotten closer to something "well-done." The waiters were very accommodating and had a new steak, this time with just the right bite in the center, for me in no time. Since the meat here is so special, it would be a shame to have it too well-done and risk losing out on some great flavors. As far as doneness goes, go on the low end of your comfort zone.I would have asked for "rare" another time through, although this would be the equivalent of medium-rare or medium in France or Italy.
