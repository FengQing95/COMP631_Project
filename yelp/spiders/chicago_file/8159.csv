Art Institute of Chicago////My favorite touch this visit:  They've had to temporarily move the modern galleries to an area slightly marooned at the end of the Asian galleries.  To make ammends, they positioned my all-time favorite Andy Warhol, a gigantic portrait of Mao Zedong, on a prominent wall looking back down through the Asian galleries.  As you enter that wing and glance down the central corridor in the Asian gallery, through priceless jade dragons and bronze dings, this gigantic portrait of the Chairman with all of Andy's embellishments is smiling enigmatically back at you, beckoning you to step on into late 20th century culture.  Clever, clever.
