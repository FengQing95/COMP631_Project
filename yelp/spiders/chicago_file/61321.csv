Smoque BBQ////Absolutely loved everything!! The lines were long as mentioned in other reviews, but it went FAST! Don't let it fool you!! (Glad we stayed) Soon as we ordered and our food was ready, our table was too. We definitely will return. Portions were large, for left overs! I can't say what I liked the most, it all was delicious! Very casual dining, small and quiet noisy. Parking is your typical Chicago, pay close to attention to the parking signs! We walked 2 blocks but no problem.
