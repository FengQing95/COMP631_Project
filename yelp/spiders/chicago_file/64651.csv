Smoque BBQ////The best barbecue joint in all of Chicago. The meats are so juicy and tender, and will melt in your mouth the moment you eat it. Sandwiches are served on large brioche buns, good for soaking up extra sauce. Carolina and Kansas City style sauces are both excellent choices, but my person favorite is the sweeter Kansas City. Almost as important as the meat, the sides are top tier as well. The mac and cheese is gooey and topped with bread crumbs while the fries not run of the mill and above average for a barbecue restaurant. The line may be a turn off, but it's well worth the wait and moves fast. Also, BYOB, useful to know ahead.
