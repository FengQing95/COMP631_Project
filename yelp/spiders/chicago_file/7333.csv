Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute is definitely the jewel in the crown of Chicago museums, and is a world-class art museum. It is most famous for its outstanding collections of Impressionists (including important paintings by Monet, Renoir, Cezanne, etc.) and of American art (Edward Hopper's Nighthawks, for example). The Art Institute has lots of other interesting things, including modern art (Picasso, for example), and The Thorne Minature Rooms: 68 minature rooms showing European interiors from the late 13th century to the 1930s and American furnishings from the 17th century to the 1930s. Very cool, and incredibly well done.
