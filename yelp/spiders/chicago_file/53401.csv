Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Delicious!! First, make sure you try the brunch. The sausage rice was one of the best dishes I have had at any time of day anywhere and it was actually a pretty decent size (though shareable would be a stretch). The chicken and waffles on a stick was also very tasty. The croquetas have a unique taste but were also good and you get four so you can share. Most items are between $2 and $8 so getting a wide variety together for a table can be done for a decent price. There are over 100 items to choose from though and so many things will look good so be careful. My only caution would be that most dishes were only shareable if you wanted a very literal taste of something. Though some dishes gave more bang for the buck like the bacon Mac and cheese and the the house plate of meat and cheese. See what I mean about trying everything...
