Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I had the porkchop and my friend had the fried chicken.  We shared an order of the brussel sprouts.  The porkchop was massive and delicious.  For such a big cut of meat it was perfectly cooked, moist and juicy and well seasoned.  My friend's fried chicken was good, but not great.  The mixologist really talked up the fried chicken, so we were both disappointed when it was good, but not amazing.  He also recommended the brussel sprouts for the veggies and said his mom said they were the best she's ever had.  They weren't, in fact, they were the only thing about the restaurant that was bad.  They weren't roasted or tossed with bacon bits, as I expected.  Instead they were drenched in this cream-based sauce, which just made the sprouts slimey and mushy.  Sad.
