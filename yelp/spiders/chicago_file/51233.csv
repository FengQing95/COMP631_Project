Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tapas are very delicious, especially those red marked popular items. The atmosphere is more designed for couples we guess. Romantic and a bit dark. Makes you relax. I went this place with group of friends. It's always a good idea to dinning with friends so that you could order more tapas and share various different things. We ordered garlic shrimp for twice since we all like it very much. There are 6 pieces come in one order. The spicy potato definitely caught my stomach. I am not such a potato fan but I ate a LOT of spicy potato. It's just fried great! The hanger steak is also good. We tried the rib, it was super soft and delicious. Paella is OK since we all agree the one we ordered is too salty. Overall I would recommend you to check this place out.
