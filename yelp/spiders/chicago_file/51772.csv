Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////What can I say...as always the food was wonderful! Patatas bravas, fried Shishto peppers, garlic potato salad, Manchego stuffed mushrooms, Beef skewers, buttermilk chicken thighs, roasted dates ALL phenomenal! But of course the highlight of the evening was again the Paella Mixta OMG! A shout out to our waiter for the free desserts.
