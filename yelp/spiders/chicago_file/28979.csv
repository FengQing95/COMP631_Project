Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When I opened up the pizza box after picking it up at the restaurant, I was really nervous that the pizza would go stale or not be as fresh since it was sitting inside a pizza box for roughly half an hour. As soon as I bit into my pizza, all those worries went away. The cheese were so stringy, and the butter crust was amazing.
