Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Order the Sangria for your table, and keep it coming. Don't be the girl that refuses to drink from the pitcher. You're not that pretentious sweetheart, just fall in line. Don't worry about your diet here either. There is nothing on this menu that is remotely healthy for you. You came for the atmosphere, remember?
