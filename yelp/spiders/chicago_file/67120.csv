Little Goat Diner////Had a great first experience at Little Goat and will definitely be back.  Met a friend for an early dinner on a Wednesday night.  No wait, seated immediately.  Service was great and the blueberry pancakes were heaven on a plate.   Served with cream cheese butter, oatmeal crumbles and the best maple syrup I've ever had (our server explained that it was the winner at the national maple syrup convention this year - um yeah, I believe ya).  The portions were ginormous and I took the leftovers home to my hungry and thankful husband who promptly devoured them and pronounced them amazing as well.  Go here.  Eat pancakes.  I'm sure the rest of their dishes are yummy as well.
