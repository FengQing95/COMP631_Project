Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Oh Cafe Ba Ba Reeba... if only I could bring you home with me. I've loved this place since my sister took me 10 years ago when she lived in Chicago, and I have to say my heart broke a little when I found out there is one in Las Vegas the week after visiting. Seriously, this place is so good it may be the answer to world peace.
