Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////In the end our bill was $26 for two salads, a soda, two personal pizza's and the dessert was free.  That's typically what a lunch would cost us at cosi/panera etc  in the city. On top of that with the food and service being so great, I'd have to say this place may trump my original Chicago pizza favorite Giordano's.
