Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Yes it is a chain...but you need to get past that and accept that the food is yummy, the sangria is cheap and strong, and the wait staff is friendly, informative, and not at all pushy despite the fact that they are usually crazy busy.  My favorite dishes are the tomato bread, spicy potatoes, and baked goat cheese.  I think the food here is more consistent quality than Cafe Iberico, and I would much rather have a reservation than stand around waiting for an hour on a Saturday night.
