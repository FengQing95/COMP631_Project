Little Goat Diner////- Biscuits. Which are technically on the breakfast menu. But since you can order breakfast all day and our waiter talked about how delicious the biscuits were, we had them as an appetizer. That's normal right? GUYS. Words are falling short but its the kinda food that makes you happy.
