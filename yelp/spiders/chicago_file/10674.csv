Art Institute of Chicago////The collection is also diverse. You don't have to pretend that you're legitimately Â interested in a shovel.... painted green... super-glued to a canvas... and how that somehow represents art. They have paintings, sculptures, ancient weapons, Native American clothing, Grecian urns and pottery, African beads, ancient coins, Victorian jewelry, tapestries... there is just so much to see that there is truly something for everyone.
