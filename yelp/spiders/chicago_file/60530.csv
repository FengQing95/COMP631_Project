Smoque BBQ////Now for my meal last night...I ordered the brisket chili, the sampler of St. Louis ribs (1/4 slab) and the cornbread.  The brisket in the chili was good, but I was looking for bark chunks and was disappointed that there weren't any.  It was a bit on the watery side for my liking for chili -- I prefer the stick-to-your-ribs kind of chili that leaves me satisfied until breakfast the next day.  There was, however, a nice balance of meat, beans and tomatoes in the chili.  The spiciness was very good too:  a heat that wasn't so overpowering that people who can't handle spiciness should shun away from this.
