Little Goat Diner////OK, here it goes. I was not very impressed. To be honest I am so disappointed. As a fan of Stephanie from Top Chef I am very let down. The menu seemed to be full of losing dishes from the show. I struggled to find anything that sounded appetizing from the menu. And what I finally chose, the almighty goat burger was too big to eat and lacked any real zing. I will not be ordering this again. My date had the fish tostadas and they looked ok but less than inspired. The décor is a little forced but had some nice features including some really big booths, if you were lucky enough to get one. I guess we were not hipster enough to merit anything in the mostly empty place other than a small table with uncomfortable chairs.  There is shag carpeting. Yes, In a diner. Needless to say it was filthy and off putting. I will not say that this was the worse experience I have had but I struggle to recall any bigger letdown. I will give this place another chance but only if I happen to be nearby, starving and unable to locate a better option.
