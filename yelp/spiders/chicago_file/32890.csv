Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The bread is warm, home made and accompanied by creamy butter. We shared the goat cheese appetizer which reminded me of dipping my bread in my mom's pasta sauce as a kid.  I am not a steak eater, so I cannot comment on the meat, however my date said it was one of the best steaks he's had. The salmon was cooked to perfection. For sides we ordered the corn and creamed spinach.  The spinach was awesome. The corn was good, but nothing I got excited about.
