Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Their wines-by-the-glass list has expanded while their Sherry and cordial list has shrunk.  One of the fun things about chatting with the bartenders here in the past was having the opportunity to learn about Spanish wines and spirits.  They still have at least one offering in each category of sherry so I think you might be able to talk them into offering you a flight...on a weeknight.
