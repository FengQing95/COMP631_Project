The Purple Pig////I'm not one to hate on hyped restaurants for the sake of not being mainstream.... but wow, I was really disappointed by Purple Pig. Personally, everything just seemed bland. We ordered the crispy pig ears, the pork shoulder, and ravioletto. The crispy pork ears had us in the first half, but gradually became a sodium overload over the course of the meal. I wish there were more egg or pickled vegetables in the dish to offset the saltiness. The pork shoulder was incredibly bland from the gravy to the meat to the mashed potatoes. I'm a huge pasta fanatic and was let down by the ravioletto, which again tasted very plain despite its rich ingredients. I personally wouldn't take any friends here if they were visiting.
