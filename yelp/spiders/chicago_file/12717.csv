Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////we ordered calamari fritta, buffalou wings, and the combination platter(mozzarella sticks, cheddar cubes, breaded zucchini and mushrooms) as our appetizers.. i liked the calamari, its crispy on the outside and its not too chewy... skip the bufflou wings and the combination platter.. i had fast food joints make wings and mozzarella sticks better then them..
