Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Great breakfast spot across the side street to millenium park. Close to our hotel and also read great reviews. Love their strawbeerrry french toast, chocolate chip pancakes, and mexicana sizzling plate. Â A bit spicy but man it was tasty. Coffee and service was good too. I would come back to breakfast if I stay close by.
