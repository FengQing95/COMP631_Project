Smoque BBQ////Simply the best - head and shoulders above the rest.  Outstanding B B Q Brisket.  But then again everything else is too.  Beans, cornbread, slaw and all the other Smoque meats made slowly and lovingly in that vast oven.  So much research and time went into the food served at this small but delectable restaurant and it shows from first taste to last.
