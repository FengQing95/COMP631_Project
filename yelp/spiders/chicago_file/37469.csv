Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I visited this place with my friend on the last night of our trip to Chicago. And it definitely made our day. The staffs were amazingly nice. The part I liked most was that they didn't give any pressure to leave Â after finishing the meal. We had ribeye steak with fries and shrimp dejonghe. The latter was soooo good. Don't forget to DIP the bread in the sauce which tastes awesome w the garlic scent! They had good wines and it was perfect to have a glass of wine w their relazing atmosphere and music.
