Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////There was no wait when we went for lunch and we were seated right away. The waitress was very helpful when we asked for suggestions. Everything on the menu looked appetizing. We finally decided on their house salad and a deep dish pizza. The food was absolutely delicious! I don't know what they put in their salad dressing, but it is addicting. The pizzas were made to perfection and the crust was very crunchy and chewy. We ended up buying a bottle of their dressing on the way out because I knew I was going to crave it. It's that good!
