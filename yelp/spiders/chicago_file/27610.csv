Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////10/10 best pizza I've ever had in my entire life. Their deep-dish is to die for. Lou Malnati's is a Chicago staple- whenever I have friends visiting from out of town, we come here (or order in). Whenever I meet out-of-towners who ask for restaurant suggestions, I always recommend Lou Malnati's.
