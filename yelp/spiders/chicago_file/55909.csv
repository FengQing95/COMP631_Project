Smoque BBQ////Get the sliced brisket! It's so tender it won't even stay on you fork! Being from Tennessee and living there for 25 years of my life I like to think I know my BBQ. This place is so good all around! The food and the friendly staff. If you live here in Chicago and haven't tried this place, do it! If your in town visiting and have time to make a stop here you won't be disappointed. Just know that's its BYOB and cafeteria style seating arrangement. The patio is great on a warm summer night. Be prepared to wait on the weekend.
