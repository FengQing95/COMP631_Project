Little Goat Diner////This is the only thing I didn't order, but since I shared all these other things, a friend gave me half of his order. This was AMAZING! It's waffles with bacon maple syrup, fresh cut bananas and peanut butter-butter. Wow! The waffles start out crunchy, and the maple bacon syrup give it its sweet and smoky flavor. That alone, would have made it a 6/10. The bananas are so ripe and sweet and add a really good flavor to the whole bite. That ups it to 7/10! Then the peanut butter-butter. The thought of peanut butter on a waffle is not something I ever even thought of. The butter really does taste like peanut butter, but you don't have to worry about trying to spread it. It melts just like butter, and it really does taste like warm gooey peanut butter. That peanut butter flavor plus the waffle and syrup would have made it a 10/10, but the fact that it also compliments the bananas so well, makes this probably the best waffle I've ever had!
