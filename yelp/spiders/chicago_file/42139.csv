Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Another great place visited with fellow Yelper Mary B. during her time in Chicago. We sat in a covered outdoor patio with nice lighting on a perfect summer night. It was my first experience with Tapas (I think Milwaukee maybe has one Tapas restaurant) and everything was fantastic. I love the delicate portions for fit for tasting and enjoying but not getting stuffed. Definitely fantastic sangria and perfect atmosphere. It was very crowded on the weekend night we visited. Worth the wait!
