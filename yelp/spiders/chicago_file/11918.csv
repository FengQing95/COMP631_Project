Art Institute of Chicago////Came here during our trip to Chicago since locals kept telling us it was a must see. First let me just say that this place is HUGE. You will need all day to see it all. They have a ton of different art galleries and different sections for pieces. We really enjoyed going into the different areas and seeing the beautiful art. I would definitely recommend this spot.
