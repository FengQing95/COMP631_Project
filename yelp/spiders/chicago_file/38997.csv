Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////If you want to eat at Bavette's, I highly recommend thinking about planning your dinner about a month in advance because that is typically how long it takes to secure a decent time for a reservation (unless you're lucky and score same day reservations). This may sound daunting, but believe me when I say it's worth the wait.
