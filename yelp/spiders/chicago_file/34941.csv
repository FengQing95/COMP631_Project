Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Just like gilt bar, this gem down the street equally impresses. My boyfriend booked dinner here for our anniversary and we enjoyed it tremendously. The decor was very vintage inspired down to the decorative plates. We ordered the baked goat cheese as our appetizer, which was extremely tasty. Â My boyfriend ordered the short rib stroganoff, I had a few bites (YUM!) I ordered the petite duchess cut filet mignon which melted with each bite; it was heavenly. Our waiter was pleasant and very knowledgeable of the menu, preparation and cocktails. Our dessert of choice was the incredible lemon meringue pie in which the presentation sold us from the get go. It was brought to our table with a sparkler and we were met with an unforgettable taste of lemon and marshmallow-y texture from the fluffy topping; truly a must have! Downstairs is another story! You almost go back in time with the speak easy vibe and dim lighting. The bartender is working his/her magic mixing unique and tastebud tingling cocktails that make you order one after another (and an Uber,lol). This entire restaurant isn't just your typical sit down but an experience that brings you back for more. We will be back for sure!
