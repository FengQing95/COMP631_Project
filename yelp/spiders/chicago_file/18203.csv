Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Thin crust sausage or the Lou pan is awesome!  The buttery crust is so addicting and I would recommend this to locals and visitors.  If you want a taste of delicious Chicago pizza this is the place to go.  Quite honestly I don't think many people from Chicago actually eat deep dish pizza,  that's more of a tourist thing.  We definitely appreciate the good thin crust or pan pizza instead.
