Art Institute of Chicago////Great museum with lots of amazing pieces of artwork, including iconic pieces like: The one where they're sitting in a Waffle House after a long night of drinking (Hopper's Nighthawks); The one where people go to the beach wearing full-length formalwear for some reason (Seurat's A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte); The zombie jammin' out to Zeppelin (Picasso's The Old Guitarist); The selfie from a dude with one ear using an old Nokia flip phone so that the photo is pixelated (van Gogh's Self-Portrait), and the old dude with a pitchfork who is gonna warn you not to try to raise your pet from the dead because "sometimes dead is better" standing next to his apparently once-dead wife (Wood's American Gothic). There's a modern wing as well, but I personally would recommend spending most of your time looking at the things that aren't in that area...well, except maybe to see the Abraham Lincoln sculptures because those were pretty cool. Just don't ride on the giant kitty cats outside the museum. That apparently is frowned upon in this establishment.
