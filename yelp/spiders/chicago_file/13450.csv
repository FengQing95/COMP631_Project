Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Eh. I've had better. Was expecting more due to the reviews but I was very disappointed. We ordered delivery so maybe that's different than eating in but either way, our pizzas were nothing to write home about. We ordered a GF pizza and a regular classic deep dish and both crusts fell far below our expectations. Maybe it's one I will have to give a second chance but for now, 2 stars it is.
