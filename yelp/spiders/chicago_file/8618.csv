Art Institute of Chicago////A landmark collection and museum. GO!  That being said, do NOT eat in the restaurant there. I have given this place two chances and it is expensive, slow, and, one of the most badly laid out places I have ever been. You can't tell which line is for which meal and the food is mediocre at best. They also seem to be very very understaffed.  Go for the art but skip the meal.
