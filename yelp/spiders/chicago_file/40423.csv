Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Part 2a - You don't do an $80 steak often so when you do there is no margin for error. And the BOH of Bavette's just nailed it! Medium-Rare (+) - yes, they accommodated and that little nuance of temperature did everything it could to bring this steak to one of, if not the best i've ever had.  Details aside, it was an experience like no other.  And if you even try to mess with the simple seasoning treatment they afford this steak, you're doing yourself a disservice.  Leave it as is and let this month long + dry aged steak shine!
