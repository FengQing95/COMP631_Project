Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The butter crust is crispy and soaks everything up. The sauce still has tomato chunks in it and is still acidic. You can tell it's very fresh. The amount of cheese they give you is also ridiculous, in an awesome kind of way. You could tell the sausage was very fresh and they made it themselves. There's no way you could get frozen premade sausage that is that good. The whole pie compliments itself and everything goes together very well. It's like a symphony in your mouth. Every ingredient has a purpose and it works together in perfect harmony to create this pizza. This is something everyone should experience at least once in their life. It's as good as all the food channels and travel shows make it out to be. Lives up to the hype in every way.
