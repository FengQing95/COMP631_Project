Little Goat Diner////Holy smokes, this place is popular already. I thought I was going to be sneaky and come in after 1 on a weekday for a late lunch - that it wouldn't be packed. Boy, was I wrong. There was a WAIT. I couldn't believe it. Then again, let's be real. Stephanie is the o.g. - original goat. Her name commands serious respect.
