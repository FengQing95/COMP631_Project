Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The rest of the story................The last night in Chicago we thought we'd give "The City" another chance to redeem herself.  So we ate at Pizanos.  YES!  We found the pot at the end of the pizza rainbow!  Thick crust, thin crust, toasted ravioli!  The waitstaff was great too!
