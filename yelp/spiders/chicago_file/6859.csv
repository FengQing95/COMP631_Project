Art Institute of Chicago////I never miss visiting this museum on my trips to Chicago.  Go there and prepare to be blown away.  I wish I could go there right now.....  My favorite piece:  Van Gogh's Bedroom in Arles.  My favorite collection:  the freakiness of the Modern wing.  The architectural collection (in the modern wing) with its video animations was also riveting!   When your feet start to ache, have a latte and pastry in the balcony cafe.  Enjoy!!
