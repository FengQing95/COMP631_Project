Smoque BBQ////It's worth noting that they were busy on a Saturday afternoon, as expected.  The line was almost out the door, but we waited maybe 20-30 minutes max from the line to receiving our food.  They have a good system here - wait in line, order at the counter, and when your food is ready, THEY tell you where to sit.  This prevents people from "saving" tables and camping out while they wait for their food.
