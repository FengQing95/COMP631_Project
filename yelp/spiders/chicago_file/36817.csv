Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The second time, it had the same lovely char that I crave, the nice sear on the outside,  and great pink center with the red eye that is the hallmark of a medium rare done right. The cooking was even throughout,  just the way you want it, even with the high sear. It is a balancing act that is deceptively difficult to pull off. It is what separates the great steakhouses from the very best steakhouses. They executed perfectly!
