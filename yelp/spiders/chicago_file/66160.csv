Smoque BBQ////Maria helped me out with this, and was not only extremely helpful and kind, but also made sure that I was taken care of for the error. It is service like this along with the quality and taste of their food that makes this place the best BBQ spot in the city. I know this is not so much a review of the food, which is worth the calories and trip here everytime, but wanted to give feedback on the exceptional service provided by the staff, especially Maria!
