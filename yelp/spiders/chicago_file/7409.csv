Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute has a wonderful collection of contemporary art - you can hunt down famous artists to your heart's content, or you can look for the design section, where you'll find quirky items like a chandelier composed of hinged desk lamps and a pendant lamp with a holographic light bulb. Nearby there's also a fun, interactive video installation that constructs a spiderweb that you as a viewer can manipulate.
