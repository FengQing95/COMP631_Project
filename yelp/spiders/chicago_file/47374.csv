Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went here for a large reception, and they did a great job with the private event. There were so many things that were SO GOOD. Favorites included: baked goat cheese, roasted potatoes with tomato aioli, bacon wrapped dates, and pork paella. My main complaint (why this isn't five star) is they seemed to recycle dishes, and they put so much food on the menu that by the time we got to the heavier courses, no one was hungry anymore! We were all looking at these thick skewers of meat thinking both: wasn't this with a slightly different sauce on the side (or, in the case of the chicken, the same sauce on the side) an earlier plate? Also, how can I eat any more? On the realm of disappointment: I wasn't a fan of the chicken toro (a little bland and a bit of a repeat) or the chocolate cake (which seemed pretty devoid of interesting flavors). Overall, though, very attentive service and a great experience!
