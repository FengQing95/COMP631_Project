Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ate here twice during my 5 day stay to Chicago.  They delivered to the hotel both times.  The first time we met with the deep dish sausage/pepperoni and the second night we went thin crust sausage/pepperoni.  Both were amazing!  I liked the deep dish and my wife liked the thin crust better.  Delivery took an hour both times.
