Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I tried to get a dinner reservation for 3 months to this place. Holy crap was it worth it!  I can't say I'm the most supportive human of Covid restrictions & Bavettes is very strict on their health safety so I was a little put off by all the prerequisites prior to showing up for the reservation but I decided to give it a go anyways. If that wasn't the best decision of 2021 I don't know what is!
