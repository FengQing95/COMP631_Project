The Purple Pig////Out of towner and decided to try this place because of the reviews and was also recommended by a friend. Dropped by on a Saturday night and there was a 2 hour wait for a table but we opted to just standing in the patio since there were no seats open at the bar. I'd recommend getting reservations if you wanted a table.
