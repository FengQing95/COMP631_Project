Smoque BBQ////This place is awesome.  Fast BBQ, great prices, huge portions and delicious!  You go in, place your order and then get seated.  I ordered the half slab of baby back ribs with slaw, fries and Mac and cheese. It came with a lot of fries that were super crispy.  If there were any negatives, it was that the fries had a bit too much oil in them but that's where the flavor is at!  You definitely don't come here if you are trying to diet.  The ribs were tender but not fall off the bone soft.  The sauce had a little kick but was delicious.  The cole slaw was awesome. It was made of cabbage and onions with some kind of vinaigrette mixture.  No mayo in cole slaw!  Everyone working there was extremely nice and friendly.  After eating, they even cleaned off and bused my table!  I felt bad as I was leaving because I should have given them a tip!  Sorry!
