Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I visited with a friend for a fun Friday night dinner, and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it!  We were seated on the patio, which was fun....and the place was packed.  We tasted a variety of dishes, and most of them were quite good.  The goat cheese and the pecan crusted chicken were my personal faves :)  The Sangria is good, and comes in many varieties.  Be sure to order by the pitcher, because it goes quickly!!   The service was fantastic, and the manager (Lindsay) is a doll!  Everything is so affordable, and it is fun to be able to try so many different dishes!  I will definitely be going back!  Great place to go with friends or a date.
