Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Super tasty foods.  Been here for paella, tapas, flamenco.. it's all been good.  I love bringing people here.  The best tapas I've had in the city.  I crave this place way more than I make it here, which is unfortunate.  Get some bacon wrapped dates!  Get some potato bravas, scallops.. goat cheese bread.. agh... SOOO GOOD!  If this place were either cheaper or closer, I'd be here at least once a month.  Sangria is pretty decent.
