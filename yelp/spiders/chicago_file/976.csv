Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Fabulous breakfast place- I went to the Schaumburg location. Gets crowded around 9 so try to go early if possible or be prepared to wait. I got berry crepes and they were wonderful. Honestly not as big of a pancake selection as I thought there would be but the selection is *pretty* vast. Would recommend!
