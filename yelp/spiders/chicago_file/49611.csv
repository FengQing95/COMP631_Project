Smoque BBQ////  It is safe to say that I have tried everything on the menu by now.  My two favorites are the BBQ pork sandwich and the chicken salad.  The flavor of the pulled pork and the brisket in this place is crazy, it's ilke they have an old fashioned smoke house hiding in the back.  The french fries are crispy, just greasy enough and salted to perfection.  Cornbread=delicous and the mac n cheese may actually have crack hidden in it.  The grilled chicken salad has the smoky flavor as well and is crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside.   The small salad is enough for two meals.  I recommend getting the small with an extra piece of chicken and saving it for later.
