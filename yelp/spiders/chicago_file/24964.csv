Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Anyways since I wasn't in Chicago she got a deep dish pie to go. The key is to request it half baked so that you can bake it again at home. We got the The Malnati Chicago Classic™, which has  a buttery crust, extra mozzarella cheese, the pizzeria's own sausage. Honestly it held up pretty well and I was happy it re cooked at home. Probably one of the best deep dish pizzas in Chicago, personally, I am more of a NYC slice person. But every so often I want some deep dish.
