Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The breakfast paella was much larger than I anticipated, and was more than enough for four of us in addition to the other few dishes we shared. The rice had a great texture, and the flavors were delicious and well balanced! It's definitely better to get the paella when going with a slightly bigger group, in order to try other things.
