Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place would get 5 stars if it was not for us having to wait 45 minutes after our reservations to be seated. Although we had to wait and was worth the wait. Not only did the restaurant comp our drinks, we got a seat in the basement, which is a totally different vibe from the upstairs/bar area. The basement is decked out in dim lighting, plush seats and chill music. We had the bone marrow, halibut & dry aged steak--all amazing! Will definitely be back again. Perfect date night spot.
