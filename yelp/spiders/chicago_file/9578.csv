Art Institute of Chicago////I too had a sketch pad and would go to the armory and learn about medieval weapons.  I would go to the watercolor paintings that I found amazing from Japan and just read and learn more about different cultures.  I saw a few kabuki theater productions at the Art Inst. and not until I worked for 2 Japanese Musicians did I know more of the back story about those arts and how they are funded and brought to the Art Inst.
