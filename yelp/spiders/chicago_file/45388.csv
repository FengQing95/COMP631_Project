Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////For the tapas we had the Pintxos platter; Citrus-cured salmon with cucumber toast; Endive & blue cheese salad with walnuts, quince; Skirt steak herb butter, shallots, scallions.  Out of all of them the only one I liked was the skirt steak.  The salmon was really watery and it didn't seem like the temperature was right on any of the dishes.  I also discovered I don't like quince (at least the way they served it) and will avoid it in the future.
