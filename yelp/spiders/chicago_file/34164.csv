Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food itself was absolutely stellar. We were recommended by our bartender to order the smoked trout and crisp potato (!) caesar salad, the prime bone-in dry aged ribeye, mashed potatoes with chicken jus, and elote style corn. I'll get the negatives out of the way now: the ONLY weak dish was the corn. Other than that, I cannot say enough great things about the food. The salad was so unique and tasty that we ate almost the entire salad. We split the ribeye for our entree and I'm so happy that we did because it was enormous. I have to say, this may have been the best steak I have ever eaten in my entire life. Better than anything I've had in New York, hands down. It was so juicy and flavorful it was almost like eating butter, that was how good the texture was. I am still salivating thinking about that beef. The smashed potatoes with chicken jus and roasted garlic was to die for, lumpy and velvety with hunks of garlic and chicken drippings over the top. I cannot even put to words how delicious this all was. We were absolutely stuffed otherwise we would have gotten dessert but there was just no room left after I ate my body weight in beef.
