Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Fantastic place to eat with a group! I absolutely love Cafe Ba Ba Reeba. I've came here on many occasions for dates, birthday's and girl's nights. Their sangria is to die for, their tapas (small plates) are a very decent size to share (not as small as I expected), and the staff is great! It is a fun atmosphere for anyone, and your belly will be pleased. Definitely join their text-club, they send you monthly texts for free plates that you may not try normally but get the chance to.
