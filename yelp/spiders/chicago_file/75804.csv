Little Goat Diner////Stephanie Izard is brilliant. She's a Top Chef Winner (Season 4), was announced as Food & Wine magazine's "Best New Chef" (in 2011), and now runs three successful and highly acclaimed restaurants in Chicago's West Loop neighborhood. The original, Girl & The Goat, was awarded 'Best New Restaurant' by Saveur magazine. And Duck Duck Goat, a Chinese-inspired restaurant has also become a Chicago favorite. **Be sure to make reservations for those places as they book up weeks in advance. Or they also take walk-ins, so feel free to take a chance!
