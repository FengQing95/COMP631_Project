Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou's is my absolute favorite deep dish in Chicago. The sauce is amazing, and the sausage! I'm not a fan of sausage in general, but the sausage at Lou's is delicious. The staff is always so nice and make you feel welcome! Lou's will always be a go to for me when in Chicago.
