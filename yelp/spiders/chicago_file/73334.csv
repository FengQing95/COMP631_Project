Little Goat Diner////Lots of interesting food selections -- chorizo maple syrup, kimchi breakfast concoctions, and my personal favorite (and probably something I get e-v-e-r-y time, the Bullseye French Toast chockful of crispy fried chicken bits, a heaping portion of strawberries, a generous portion of maple syrup all atop a hot, full piece of soooooft french toast... God, this place knows how to satisfy.
