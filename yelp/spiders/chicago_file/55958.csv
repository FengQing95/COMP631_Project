Smoque BBQ////I LOVE this place! Yum I am rating food here and I happen to love good BBQ! This place has awesome baked mac and cheese, delish peach cobbler and different yet tasty coke slaw. The ribs are my daughters fav and reg (not baked) mac and cheese for my young boys are always on the list. Hubby likes the pulled pork and sausage. My weakness is the chopped brisket! Wish we lived closer. Actually, maybe not. I'd probably be 20 lbs heavier! lol Even got my brother and his GF enjoying it! She lives close.
