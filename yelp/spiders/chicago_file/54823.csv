Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We had a reservation here at 7:30pm on a Friday night. Needless to say, it was very busy. It has a large, first come first serve bar and another large room dedicated to seating only. We ordered a half pitcher of white sangria which was just the right amount of sweet. We ordered garlic shrimp and spicy potatoes along with salmon and a chicken empanada. All delicious and very well seasoned. Keep in mind these are all small plates so a dinner for two would consist of at least 4-5 tapas in my opinion. We also received the free dessert by checking in on the Yelp app. It was tiny (tapa sized) but delicious. Great service, great food, and a relaxed cozy environment that's great for meal sharing. Tip: if you sign up for the emails on the website, you get a $10 off voucher that's valid every day except Saturdays!
