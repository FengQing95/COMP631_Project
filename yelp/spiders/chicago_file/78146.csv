Little Goat Diner////I don't know what to call it but it was Pho like it its presentation (and last course before dessert) - the meat was amazing, the rice noodles were delicious, the beans in the soup had a great smokey quality.  This is the kind of thing I would love to eat by the barrel full in the middle of winter.  I would sit outside to eat this in the middle of a chicago winter.
