Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Yup, Chicago Pizza and the places that serve it suck.  I've finally made up my mind.  I tried Malnati's, Uno, Giordano's and Pizano's, so you can't say that I didn't  give it a shot. The sauce is always watery and tasteless, without even a hint of garlic.  Like pomodoro vs. marinara maybe, to make a pasta comparison.  The outside crust is almost always too hard, due to the long time required to cook something as thick as lasagne.
