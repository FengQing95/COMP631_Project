Little Goat Diner////At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks.
