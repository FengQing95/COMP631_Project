Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were served lukewarm pizza (cheese deep dish) after a 45min wait.  The people around us got steaming hot pizza - we were just unlucky.  The waiter offered to reheat the pizza, but I just felt they tried to serve someone else's old pizza. We returned the pizza and had the item removed from our bill. We had buffalo wings and mozzarella sticks as appetizers, and they were ok.
