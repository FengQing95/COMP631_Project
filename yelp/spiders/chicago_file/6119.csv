The Purple Pig////With an expansive menu, we were a tad overwhelmed at where to start initially with so many great options to choose between. Our server was able to help us narrow down some great options. As a party of 5 we ordered 5 plates in addition to to a board. We did one item from each section (veg, seafood, etc) but got two under pork (if it's in the name of the restaurant, you know it's the right way to go).
