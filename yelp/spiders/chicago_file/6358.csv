The Purple Pig////To drink, I had the Wallflower [$15]. My friends had the Paper Plane [$15] and a glass of the Picpoul [$13], the latter of which was the recommended pairing with the tagliatelle. Everyone enjoyed their drinks, and found that they went well with the dishes we ordered. When combined with the pork shoulder, I found that the Wallflower provided that brightness I was looking for!
