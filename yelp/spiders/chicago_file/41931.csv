Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Purty good, met some work friends here once.  Tapas in general to me means you get more plate than food, but I guess if you've got deep pockets and/or a small appetite then tapas is a nice way to sample lots of stuff.  I threw back a bunch of booze and had a decent enough time, but I dunno....I've been to other tapas type places that I was more impressed with.  Damn it's crowded and loud in there too.  Not bad by any stretch, if you're in the area it's as good a stop as any.
