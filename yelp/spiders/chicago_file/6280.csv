The Purple Pig////Okay when I die, please bury me in the whipped chickpea focaccia- please and thank you. Also the mushroom agnolotti was perfection- I will say the presentation of the dish didn't get me too excited until I tasted its goodness and I took all of my judgments back. My husband is obsessed with the smashed crispy potatoes- he has dreams about them.
