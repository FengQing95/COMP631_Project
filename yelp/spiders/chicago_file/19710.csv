Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I saw this place on Throwdown with Bobby Flay, so I had to try it.  After I landed at Chicago O'hare I flew across 90 to get to my hotel at the Marriott Mag Mile so that I could drop off my luggage.  The guys at the valet confirmed that although my fab Giordano's was in closer proximity,   Lou Malnati's was the best - the concierge agreed.  When I arrived there was ample seating both inside and out, so I was seated right away.  I ordered the "deluxe" deep dish pizza on the famous butter crust.  My waiter told me it would be out in 30 minutes for the pizza, so I ordered a side house salad.  The salad was good, I really enjoyed the dijon honey mustard.  Then the famous pizza arrived and I could not wait to sink my teeth in.  I'm sorry to say, I was pretty disappointed.  I really had high hopes for this place.
