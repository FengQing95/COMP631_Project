Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place was highly recommended to me from a native Chicagoan, now a New Yorker. And I never forgot the name and what a cool one, Lou Malnati. Sounds like a gangster's name. But in this case, the gangster of Chicago deep dish pizza. Being that I live in NYC, I have so many pizza spots to choose from. $1 pizza, my favorite pizza place, vegan pizza, neopolitan, the classics(Joe's, Ray's, Artichokes, Bleeker etc..)pizza chains--and this is just a small fraction. I came to Chicago with my nose-to-the-sky knowledge on pizza and was ready for what Lou had to offer. I was sat at the bar as soon as I arrived, 935pm. I had intended for the restaurant to be mobbed, but as far as I can see there was enough space on the floor to perform The Nutcracker. I'm just glad that I don't have to wait for seating or have to sit outside--has been humid lately. An expressionless bartender asked me if I wanted to start on a drink. Nope, just a Coke. I had already skimmed the menu and knew I wanted to start on the mozz. sticks. 10 seconds later, I said I might as well put in my pizza order. And he said, might as well, it DOES take 40 minutes. But he said it like a jerk would say it. Like if common sense should have taught me this. I immediately developed a bad taste in my mouth. I couldn't let the bartender in his lonely island take away from the hype. He did mention getting the butter crust and I was later glad I did. You see, optimism. My 7 sticks came out about 10 minutes after ordering. They were gone just about as soon as they were presented to me. I like them hotter(temp) than served and the tomato sauce accompaniment was nice and chunky. And not 40 minutes, but in 25 minutes Â my personal deep dish pizza with pepperoni came out. Given to me briskly and with no eye contact. It was an interesting wait though. Got to see the staff do a lot of dancing, and dancing with whipped cream in their mouth, and play patty cake, and dance some more, and the bartender likes sandsurfing--I overheard. BUT THAT PIZZA!!! Boy, was that a delicious circular and singular sensation. I felt weird having to use a fork and knife coming from the land of slices. But I got a personal so I was able to still use my paws. I asked the bartender to go light on sauce as well. Yummy, and buttery and a taste that was so satisfying and that lingered. Each bite had the promise of a happy ending on my palette. Boy, was that a great piece of doughy heaven with poking pieces of pepperoni. I wasn't savvy on the pan sizes until after I ordered. But I think I could have easily took down the next size(for 2). I know I will be back. Maybe at this location, or maybe at another. I need to experience the greatness of this pizza once or twice again. Hope there's friendlier service next time.
