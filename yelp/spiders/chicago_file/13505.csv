Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pizza was mediocre.  We got the Classic and also the Lou DEEP DISH.  The Classic (Sausage) was much better.  Also had wings which were good but nothing great.  It comes with Ranch but I asked for Blue Cheese which the waitress was happy to bring out. We had a good conversation with her as well.  They also periodically stop by to cut and give you the next slice of pizza.
