Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Even though the name " Bar and Boeuf" evokes thoughts of a steakhouse, Bavette's  menu is far more eclectic.  The steak house classics are available ( you know the drill..... wedge salad, shrimp de jonge,  6-7 cuts of beef ranging from $40- $70, and lest we forget, the 1 pound baked potato.  )  So if you feel the need to not stray too outside your culinary box, you can order virtually almost the same type of things you get  at Ruth Chris, Morton's, or The Palm.
