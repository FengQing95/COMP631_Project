Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////the salad was a perfect starter.  then the pizza arrives.  it looks small but it is packed!!  the butter crust was like a pie crust.  melted cheese was ooey gooey.  the marinated tomatoes were the perfect compliment to the sausage topping.  the pizza got better and better as i ate more and more...heheh.  =)
