Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My return visit after 12+ years was still so good.  For wine, I had 2 white flights (the gewurtz blen and the albarino were nice) and  2 spanish reds, which were both excellent.  I'm serious about wine, too (I tried Bin 36 down the street and wasn't impressed w/ their wine).  Our waitress recommended the wines and in both cases the reds were among the cheaper by the glass, so she knew her stuff.  The dishes were nearly all excellent such as the short ribs w/ manchego mashers, the curry chicken salad, the octopus and potatoes and their generous cheese plate.  The goat cheese and tomato sauce was still very good but I've had this many a time.  The only disappointment was the special of the day with beef tenderloin was topped w/ 3 different sauces.  Oh, the olive dish is super good too.  They manage to get a very tasty marinade that no one else quite has.
