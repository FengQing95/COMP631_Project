Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It was a long wait on a cold, windy Chaco night, 45minutes. It was worth it. Ambience was good, and very lively inside. Place was a bit small than I imagined it to be. Food was good. The best deep dish pizza I've had. Love the butter crust pizza. I couldn't believe we didn't finish the whole pie! There were 4 of us, all guys. I was stuffed after eating one slice. And, they give you bite size pizza while you wait. We will definitely come back! Maybe try different Lou Malnati place!
