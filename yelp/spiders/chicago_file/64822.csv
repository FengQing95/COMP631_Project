Smoque BBQ////Does Smoque even need reviews at this point?  We all know this place is amazing, and some of the best BBQ in town.  The seating can be limited, but the food is worth any wait (and they rarely have a long wait because these servers get it done).  Try everything, and thank me (and all the other 5 star reviewers) later.  I used them for my fiance's surprise birthday party 3 years ago, and I still hear about the amazing brisket.  Get yourself some smoque!
