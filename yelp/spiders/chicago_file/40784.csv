Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food and sangria here were delicious!! Our waitress was also great. One of the waiters accidentally took one of our dishes to another table, causing us to have to wait a while for a new one, but the manager came over and was very apologetic and nice about it, and even took it off our bill. I will definitely be going back for more tapas!
