Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////While all of the dishes we got were absolutely delicious, my three favorites were the garlic shrimp, squid, and the hanger steak. The shrimp was cooked to perfection and was a blast of flavor the moment you put it in your mouth, yet not overwhelming. I'm not the biggest fan of garlic, but the combination with lemon and the pepper flakes gave it the perfect kick of spice and tang. The same went with the squid, which was chewy and tender. While this seems simple, many places serve it way too chewy making it hard to tear apart and swallow. The hanger steak - nice and medium rare, tender, and full of flavor.
