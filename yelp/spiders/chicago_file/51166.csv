Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been coming to ba-ba-reeba for almost 10 years now. My order has varied slightly over the years but I always have 3 go to's: spicy potatoes (I could actually eat this aioli on everything), bacon wrapped dates (obviously), steak with blue cheese. Here's a secret: they have select Â $3 tapas happy hour in the bar Monday-Thursday 4-6!
