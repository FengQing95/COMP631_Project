Little Goat Diner////Excellent service! Great tasting food! We had the "This little pig went to China" and it was amazing. We also had the grilled cheese sandwich again amazing. Friendly staff and great food. We came during the world series when they had a lot of traffic and it was an excellent experience. You guys must check it out.
