The Purple Pig////My last venture, had me sampling lamb ribs, gnocchi, and a whipped feta schmere. I am not even going to try to describe the food because I don't think I will have any more success then their menu does, but check my pics to gaze upon glory. And heed my words, that the food was deliSHEEous maximus.
