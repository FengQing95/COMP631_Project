Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Chocolate Cream Pie:  Skipping dessert after such a hefty meal may seem like the right thing to do but you'd be a fool to miss out on this dish - a signature according to Erik, especially when paired with a bottomless cup of La Colombe's Corsica.  More a chocolate pave than a 'chocolate cream' and resting atop an Oreo crust with a dollop of whipped cream nearly the size of the slice plus grated nutmeg this, much like the chicken, was simply what happens when a great kitchen uses great ingredients.  Sure you could make this at home, but since you probably won't I'd recommend it without hesitation.
