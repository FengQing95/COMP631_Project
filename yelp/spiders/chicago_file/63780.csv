Smoque BBQ////Now, anyone will tell you that I am very picky when it comes to brisket.  I grew up in TX and while I have had some amazing BBQ pulled pork in the midwest and northeast, I haven't found many places whose BBQ brisket provides the same lean, smoky, tender meat-eating experience.  Smoque does.  And also, there was the tasty BBQ sauce, HUGE portions (mac & cheese, peach cobbler, vinegar cole slaw) all shared between two people and it was more than enough, we were stuffed.
