Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is just a Chicago staple. It's a great place for a date night or a night out with your girls. Every dish is sharable and delicious. Highly recommend the red sangria - might as well get a pitcher (or 2) ;) Also - I dream about their bacon wrapped dates. Trust me and get them!
