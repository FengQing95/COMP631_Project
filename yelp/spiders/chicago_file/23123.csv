Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My husband and I put our names in on Saturday around 2. We went to another bar until our table was ready. I knew the food was going to take a while since it's deep dish but we weren't worried about that. We were drinking so as long as we could continue to relax and drink, we would be fine to wait and we weren't starving.
