Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our waiter took really good care of us and Rich Melman has done a great job recreating the ambiance of a Spanish Tapas restaurant.  The tapas portions here seem to be the size of a "racion" in Spain but the feel is the same.  I had the short stack pintxo and the mac n cheese with bacon to start off.  Both great - Mac n Cheese plus bacon; why has no one thought of this before?  In the lunch part of our choices my favorite was the albondigas.  We ended the meal with tastes of desserts and coffee.
