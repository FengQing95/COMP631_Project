Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Terrific Tapas! Definitely try the $2 Tapas on the top of the menu. We did the platter of all 6 for $11. What fun to have two bites of 6 different things. The dates and the beef/apple bruschett were our favorites. Garlic Shrimp is my favorite Tapas always. Theirs was good. The Paella was okay, be warned it's a full pan, not a small plate. The atmosphere is very festive and fun. Service was terrific
