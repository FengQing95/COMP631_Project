Smoque BBQ////We took my BIL here for his bday. We love to pick BBQ places (notice my review on Lillie's Q). Hubby and BIL had ribs. My other BIL and I had brisket. We all enjoyed what we ordered. The brisket is to die for! I saw complaints about the BBQ sauce on some yelp reviews, but I loved it. The cole slaw was nothing special. Corn bread and baked beans were tasty. The guys all had mac n cheese. They all liked it.
