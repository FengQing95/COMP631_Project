Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My hubby called in the order and the woman taking the order made a helpful suggestion for pizza size (small was enough for both of us and we have a small piece left for a midnight snack).  He FORGOT the butter crust, sigh.  But it was still amazing!  The crust was crispy, the cheese gooey and the sauce had chunks of tomato in it, giving great tomato flavor.
