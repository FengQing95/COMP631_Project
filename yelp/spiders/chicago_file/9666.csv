Art Institute of Chicago////If you are intent on doing the full touristy thing in Chicago, you can potentially save some money at the Art Institute with a "Citypass" that can be used at other museums and tourist-spots in Chicago. Â The catch is that you have to do all of it to really get your money's worth... I wasn't going to go to all of the places, so it was cheaper for me to just buy the regular tickets.
