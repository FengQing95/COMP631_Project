Little Goat Diner////LOVED IT! I was in town for a quick weekend getaway with my boyfriend and several friends recommended this place. It did not disappoint. It was a Sunday after the Cubs clinched the NLCS and the place was completely packed, but that's what we were expecting. We went to the bar and got a bloody mary and an old fashioned - both great. The bar is open seating so two people luckily were getting up when we finished our drinks. I had the creole crumpets and John had a special breakfast Chicago dog in honor of the win. All of it was great, the place was cute, and the staff was friendly even though they were so busy. When we are back in Chicago, we will absolutely return.
