Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute is huge, although I wasn't a fan of most of the first floor and moved on to the impressionists fairly quickly. Other favorites of the day included 'Paris Street; Rainy Day' by Gustave Caillebotte, whose work I wasn't familiar with and the beautiful jeweled box off in it's own small room in a corner.
