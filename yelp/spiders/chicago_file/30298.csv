Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////What I liked is that within a few minutes of being seated, pizza magically made its way to the tables and we were ready to eat. We got two medium sausage and pepperoni pizzas to share as well as a salad to break up the gluttonous amount of cheese we were about to indulge in. The salad was a great starter and that pizza was nothing to scoff at. The crust was super buttery and they didn't skimp on the meaty toppings.
