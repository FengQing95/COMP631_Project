Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I don't get to go to Chicago much have been maybe three times my entire life and the past few times I've visited Lou Malnati's pizza I really enjoyed it never been to this establishment before cuz there's about 20 of them across the city of Chicago so my family and I stopped in here on a Monday night. 6 it is extremely crowded which is not their fault whatsoever it's a good thing but Monday night at 6: 55 minute wait now I have a 2 year old and 4 year old so anybody out there with kids know how difficult it is to control it to 6 in the evening once again not their fault I just wanted to establish what I was going through I've been waiting and waiting for this Lou Malnati's ever since I found out we are coming to Chicago so I was excited we pre-ordered our pizza and 55 minutes later we were seated in the totals would be another 20 minutes which I was a little upset about order my kids a spaghetti kids meal and it was out in about 5 minutes so they ate their spaghetti they were finished and then I'll Pizza arrived and my 2 year old is ready to go in the pizza unfortunately was just not very good it was just not up to par and I don't know what it is it might have been because there was 7 million people in The Establishment and they made 40 million but the cross just didn't taste that great and there was enough sauce on top of it which is very unfortunate so I'll give it a three out of five I mean it was still good but for the price of $26 for a medium sausage pizza it's just not worth it in my opinion so we went to another deep dish Italian restaurant the day before and it was much better I gave that one to five out of five I don't know might just caught him on a bad night but I'm disappointed
