The Purple Pig////One of your best bets is to wait on someone to leave at the bar so you can dine there. This place is pretty pricey and slightly overrated so I'd come here more to celebrate a special occasion. Although, be forewarned they don't do anything for your birthday besides bring the dessert (that you pay for) out with a candle. The service isn't the best, I think they're aware they can get away with it given their hype, I mean look at the wait to get in. The food was done well, something with experiencing at least once.
