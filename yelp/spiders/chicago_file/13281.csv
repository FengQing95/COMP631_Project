Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place is open until 11, so found ourselves there one night for a late dinner. Was not too busy. Got seated right away, the waiter was attentive enough. The pizza was good. We got the Lou's special. Tons of sausage. The best part thought was the CALAMARI. Best calamari I have ever had.
