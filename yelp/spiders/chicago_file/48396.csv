Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I usually like trying Spanish restaurants when Im visiting a city, and this was the best decision I made in Chicago. It was authentic Spanish food. Probably the best seafood Paella I have had in the US. The sangria was awesome and the gambas al ajillo are a must. Excellent service as well! Highly recommended.
