Little Goat Diner////Came with a decent-sized group for brunch after we couldn't make it to Girl n the Goat the night before, and we were very happy with everything. From the bloody mary and coffee at the beginning of the meal to the french toast for the main course, everything was spectacular. The french toast came with an egg over easy in the middle of it, and while I was initially a little taken aback (probably because I didn't read the menu), it worked perfectly!
