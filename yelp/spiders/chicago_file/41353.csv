Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Let me say that I have spent time in Spain and have had authentic tapas, paella and sangria.  The red sangria was delicious and not overpriced ($18 for a nice sized pitcher that at least got my date buzzed).  For tapas we just ordered the Spanish sausages and bacon wrapped dates, which were both tasty and decently priced.  The seafood paella, however, left a lot to be desired.  The portions were way to small for the price and it did not taste authentic at all.  It was very bland and a bit soggy.
