Smoque BBQ////love this place, even though the line is outside whenever I drive there all the way from the south side of chicago, It is soooo worth it! I take out of town guest here! The wait is never long and the service is great!!! Â Did I mention the food......Im a pickey eater and everyone knows this, so congrats to Smoque to living up to MY standards!!!! The best brisket I have ever eaten, mac and cheese is awesome so go on and order another for later because if you dont, around 3 hrs later, you will regret that you dont have more and digging around the edges for the last isnt cool. lol YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PLACE!
