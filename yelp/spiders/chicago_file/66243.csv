Little Goat Diner////The food was good but not great. Understood that it just opened but I will have to try again in the future once the serving kinks are worked out. We sat for 20 minutes until several different servers approached us uncertain whether we were being taken care of...which we were not. It seemed as if the employees have yet to fully understand responsibilities amongst them. Multiple tables around us were in the same situation. Not worth the 2 hours in total.
