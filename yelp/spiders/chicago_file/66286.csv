Little Goat Diner////Such a great restaurant.  I walked in and Notorious B.I.G's "Juicy" was playing in the background, and I immediately fell in love.  I've been to Girl and the Goat a few times, and absolutely love Stephanie Izard.  What I love about this place, is how casual and laid-back the vibe is at this restaurant.  I sat at the bar with my girlfriend and had a few drinks, as well as the shrimp cocktail and macho nachos.  Our bartender, started with a K or C   (gorgeous asian girl with a killer smile) steered us in the right direction as to what beers and cocktails to order, as well as the shrimp cocktail.  She seemed very knowledgeable in finding out what kind of things we liked, and didn't like, and steered us in the right direction with food and drink choices.
