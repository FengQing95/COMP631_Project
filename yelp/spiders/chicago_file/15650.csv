Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Hands down best pizza in Chicago... a few of my friends suggested that I come here for Chicago style pizza and said it's better than Gino's and Giordano's. I completely agree! My second stint in Chicago lead me to go there with a new set of friends that I made... we all walked there in a group... BUT the wait was over an hour and we were starving!
