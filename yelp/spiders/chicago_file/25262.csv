Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Delicious but be ready to wait! They say explicitly on their menu that pizzas take 30-45 minutes and it's true. It was delicious and loved that thick crust. We went half and half on a small (lous and half vegetarian) and it was plenty for two people. Service is fast and friendly. I would come back to get this again - can't speak to what the rest of the menu is like though.
