The Purple Pig////Don't come "hangrey" because there is a wait, yes even on the weekdays at 1pm. We waited about 45mins, they send you a text once your table is ready so you can go walk or shop around. Many things to do nearby. The busser brings you water, the waiter takes your order and the food arrives as it's made vs. all together. The fried pig ears were great, the milk braised pork was fantastic, fell right off of the bone. The broccoli was my personal favorite. The texture, the flavors, a little salty but but sweet. The octopus was tender and very delicious. Honestly we ordered way too much food for 2 people but it was worth it. Two thumbs up!
