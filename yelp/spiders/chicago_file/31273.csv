Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Yaaaaay Chicago deep dish!!! I was waiting for this and was not disappointed. My friend ranted and raved about it so we had to get some. We both ordered a personal size deep dish, I ordered the veggie pizza and he ordered the pepperoni ($32-ish). It was around 4:30pm when I placed the order online and the earliest pick up was 6:30pm. Sheesh! So we walked down from Springhill Suites at about 6:30pm. It was about a 10 minute walk, but I think we took the long way.
