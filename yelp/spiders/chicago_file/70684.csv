Little Goat Diner////Good diner food and made for a good brunch spot.  Huge crowds and a lengthy wait are the drawbacks on a Sunday morning.  I had the corned beef hash which was excellent.  Really enjoyed the grilled hash browns on the side.  I'd like to come back and try the lunch items but will try to time it for an off hour.
