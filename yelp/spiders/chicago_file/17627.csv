Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came highly recommended and not disappointed. Portions are large, family style salad was more than our party of 4 could handle with an appetizer and the large Malnati's. We took half the pizza home. The BBQ salad had good flavor but the bacon bits and tortillas added too much crunch and became tiring to eat. Pizza was very good! Came early for lunch 11:30 and sat down right away, when we left at 1pm, a ton of people waiting in line.
