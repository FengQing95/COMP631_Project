Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////There's a line out the door, but it's worth the wait.  The deep dish pizza here may be the single best pizza I have ever eaten.  I'm normally more a fan of thin crust pizza, because it's all about the toppings, but the butter crust here melds perfectly with the sausage and mushrooms and the whole thing just melts in your mouth.  Perfection.
