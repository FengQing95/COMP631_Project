Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////What's with the hype? This place barely gets 3 stars from me. (2.75 rounds to 3, I can do math) I was ridiculously excited to go to Chicago to consume some REAL deep dish pizza. I've only ever had Chicago "style" pizza in NY. I heard that the locals' go to Lou's for their fix. What I didn't expect was A) It's clearly a chain and has the kitschy olive garden/applebees feel to it and B) Cheese fail.
