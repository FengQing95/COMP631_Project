Little Goat Diner////Ordered the Kimchi/bacon/pancake thingy.  It's definitely something I make on a daily basis.  A fridge cleaning meal but in a good way.  The sauce that came with it was a bit too vinegary and maybe could have used a sweet element (maple syrup?) to jazz it up..but it was yummy and I cleaned my plate.
