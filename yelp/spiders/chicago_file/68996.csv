Little Goat Diner////I'm so disappointed in my experience last night. I tipped over a full glass of water all over the counter and the floor and not a single employee noticed... leaving us without a rag to wipe off ourselves, the counter and the floor with napkins... Now for the kicker, our server didn't even offer to refill my glass. So I left wet, thirsty and very annoyed. The worst service I've had in the last year. The food was still good but I can't overlook the fact that several staff walked past us cleaning off the counter and floor and didn't offer to lift a finger to even grab a rag.
