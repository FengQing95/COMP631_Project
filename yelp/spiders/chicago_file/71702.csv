Little Goat Diner////So we order lunch. My tuna melt was so saucy that the bread was mush. My friends' food was equally unimpressive. Our friend who was in town visiting was sorely disappointed. We had a $50/person diner meal that really was no better than the corner diner in my neighborhood where our meal would have been less than half the price.
