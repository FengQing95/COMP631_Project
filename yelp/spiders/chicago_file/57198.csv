Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We had what seemed like almost the entire menu. Dishes that stood out include the garlic shrimp (I think I had an entire serving of this to myself), bacon wrapped dates, ham croquettes, paella, potatas bravas. Lots of savory tastes here (mmmm the meatballs) and some dishes are kind of heavy, but there was definitely enough food to go around. And did I mention the sangria?
