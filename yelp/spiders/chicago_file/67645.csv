Little Goat Diner////great location, reasonably priced, awesome take on diner fare.  This is a place you don't want to miss, whether in Chicago for an afternoon or a week.  They have their own onsite bakery which is in the back of the side bar.  You can view the activity in the bakery through the glass windows in the bar.  Also in the sidebar, is a full-service coffee bar, bread store and specialty food shop.
