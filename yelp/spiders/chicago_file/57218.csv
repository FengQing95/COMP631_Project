Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We had pretty much everything pescatarian on the happy hour menu.  I tried the potato and omelette bite, which was alright.  It had too much aioli and wasn't super flavorful.  I also tried the stuffed olive with anchovy and piparra pepper.  It was a combination of interesting and unique flavors.  I really loved the pepper in the olive.  Lots of salty bitterness, which my taste buds love.
