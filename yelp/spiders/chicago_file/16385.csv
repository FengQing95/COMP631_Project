Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We got sausage garlic and onion w/ butter crust. The crust was...just fine. Something made the pizza very soupy, i wonder if it's the tomatoes or the onions or both. Really this was just okay. I like Giordano's better, I like Gino's East better...I like Uno/Due better...at least right now. Could they have been off? Yeah - I mean I trust you guys, most of you anyway. Most of you say it's good...and I usually agree.
