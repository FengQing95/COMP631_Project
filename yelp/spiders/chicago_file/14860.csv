Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Not my favorite deep dish, but decent all the same. I am a super sauce type of girl and while, to their credit, Lou Malnati's makes their own sauce, I don't think they put enough of it on their pizzas! If they loaded up the sauce as much as they do the cheese I would give it more praise.
