Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I sampled the grilled squid, roast eggplant salad, roast dates wrapped bacon, chicken empanada, and tuna w/ tomato.  The grilled squid was flavorless.  Dates wrapped in bacon were plentiful but didn't have the wow factor I was looking for.  The Tuna was the biggest joke ever, it was canned tuna topped with a thick slice of tomato.  The only dish that I somewhat enjoyed was the eggplant salad.  I thought the sangria would be watered down to the point of box juice, but I could taste the red wine so that was a plus.
