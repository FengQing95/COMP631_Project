Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My favorite dishes were the two goat cheese options and the scallops, which were cooked perfectly, but everything was really wonderful. Nice size portions and everything came out very quickly. We ordered our food in phases -- 2 or 3 items at a time -- and the service was incredibly prompt.
