Smoque BBQ////The sides were as impressive as the meat, and they made our barbecue session into a complete feast.  I loved the mac and cheese.  It was very cheesy with a touch of creaminess and a nice crispy topping of bread crumbs.  The beans were among some of the best I've had, full of flavor with a far cooked but toothsome texture.  The brisket chili was likewise fantastic, deeply comforting with nice shreds of meat.  The cole slaw was the only light side on the table, and it was refreshingly easy on the mayo, with crisp clean flavors to cut through the smoke and fat of our meal.  The cornbread was the one side I stopped eating after a bite.  Not bad, but not good, a little hard and a little short on butter.
