Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I then had an individual pepperoni If you want real deep dish, don't order the individual! I made the mistake of doing this, it is small and not full deep dish because it was made individually but still so amazing! The buttercrust is crispy yet soft. My favorite part is the amazing sauce on top! You can tell by the smell when you walk in they make great sauce! If I go back to Chicago I will be back!
