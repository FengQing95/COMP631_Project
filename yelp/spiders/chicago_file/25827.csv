Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've been to Lou Malnati's many times over the years, and to this location several times.  Lou's pizza is the the "perfect" Chicago style pizza.  There are others the tourists tend to crowd to, but Lou's is where the locals go for truly good Chicago pizza.  We always get the original salad and an original pizza, sometimes having pepperoni added to the pizza.  It's just perfect, and highly recommended when in Chicago.
