The Purple Pig////I came here with 5 of my friends to have dinner on Wednesday night. We went during a busy hour (around 7pm) and they were fully packed. We had to wait for over an hour and a half (which the host told us about as soon as we put our name on the waiting list). I think the wait will be shorter if you come with a smaller party.
