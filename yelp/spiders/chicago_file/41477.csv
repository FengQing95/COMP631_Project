Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////While the food is par, the service is deplorable.  I walked in at 6:45 and asked what the wait would be.  The host told me 30 minutes which was fine since I was meeting a friend at 7.  At around 7:30 we were still at the bar waiting so asked the host who said we would probably be seated shortly since our seating time was 7:31.  At 7:45 I asked again and he told me that our seating time was 8:01 and that it hadn't changed from the first time.  Luckily we had a seat at the bar so we just ordered our food there.  I don't mind waiting, but I do mind being told that I misheard the wait time.  As for the food, both times I've been here the paella is terrible but the bacon wrapped dates and baked goat cheese are fantastic.  Not the best tapas in my book.  I've definitely had better in the city.
