Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I am salivating as I write this review.  I came with a large group of girls for tapas and sangria.  We had a reservation and were seating promptly at a great table.  We ordered so many things, the best by far were the bacon wrapped shrimp, chrorizo wrapped medjool dates, and patatas bravas.  My only complaint was that I had to share them.  :)  Next time I go back I am going to be ordering my own plates and keeping them to myself! Yum, yum, yum...
