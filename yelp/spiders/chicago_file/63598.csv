Smoque BBQ////I was in the city today and decided it was time to give this place a try. Since I live about 30 miles from Smoque, take out isn't really a good option. So dine-in, it was. I waited about 15 minutes until they took my order, then was assigned a table right next to the waiting line of people that I had stepped out of. The idea of dining amidst a human canyon isn't a good one and very nearly knocked this place down a star or two rating-wise.
