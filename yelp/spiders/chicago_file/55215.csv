Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I just realized that it's a shame for somebody living in Chicago not to know this place. Came here for a team dinner. Food is great! Ordered popular dishes including bacon wrapped dates. Paella is delicious. I like crispy rice on the side. Very large portion. Small would be enough for 3 people.
