Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My boyfriend and I came here for his birthday dinner. Immediately, we were both in love with the ambiance - very intimate, low lighting, jazz music playing. I wish I remembered our waiter's name, but he was so great! Customer service was on point, as were the recommendations for entrees, sides and dessert.
