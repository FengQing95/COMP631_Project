Little Goat Diner////With a James Beard award and Top Chef plus Iron Chef titles to her name, Stephanie Izard has already entered the pantheon of Chicago culinary royalty. Little Goat is the dressed-down, diner version of her flagship enterprise, Girl & the Goat, with a more globally inspired twist. To be quite honest, I have visited GatG somewhere between 2-4 times (though it has been a few years) and I always found the fare to be on the salty side. Their whole goat leg IS shockingly tasty however. I actually favor Duck Duck Goat, Izard's homage to Chinese cuisine, as the superior restaurant. These were the thoughts percolating in my mind as I sat down for brunch at Little Goat, specifically on their covered and enclosed street-side patio.
