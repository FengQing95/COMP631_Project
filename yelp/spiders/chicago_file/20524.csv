Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou's fares the least favourite when it comes to the deep dish, which is really confusing since a majority of its locations has numerous reviews. I had the personal pizza when I first tried the deep dish; it lacked overall flavour and was a really small size for a personal pizza. The second time I tried a larger deep dish with a group of friends and we all agreed that it lacked flavour and the crush had no taste at all. It seems as though the deep dish crusts in general have a lack lustre when it comes to taste, perhaps something needs to be done! We also didn't like the bruschetta either for the general lack of flavour. After trying many different restaurants, I don't know if I would have a deep dish here again. Although, I am curious to try the regular pizza for comparisons.
