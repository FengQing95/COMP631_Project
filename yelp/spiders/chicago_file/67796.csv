Little Goat Diner////I love the playful and lively ambience of this restaurant. If you're in the mood for light meal with subtle flavors, this may not be the place for you; but if you're looking for something savory, filling and slightly decadent, you should stop by. I've had the kimchee, bacon and eggs pancake. I thought the dish was fun and inventive. It was a light (but massive) pancake with the flavors of a southeast asian pork noodle bowl, accented with Korean kimchee and loaded with bacon. I've also tried the veggie lovers caesar salad, which unfortunately wasn't  too exciting,  except for the deep fried anchovies. I'm looking forward to trying other items on the menu. I think this restaurant, with its reasonable prices, great food and backstory (owned by a Top Chef winner) is also a good place to bring out of town guests.
