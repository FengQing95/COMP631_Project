Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered the "Malnati Chicago Classic," which came with Lou's lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust.  It was positively ambrosial.  The cheese just melted in my mouth and the crust was so crunchy.  It was such a glorious meal on a crisp October day in Chicago.  The personal pan size was enough food for this hungry foodie!
