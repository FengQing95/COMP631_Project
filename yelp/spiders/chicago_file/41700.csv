Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I found this to be a pretty good tapas restaurant.  I came with a group of 8 and we were able to get seated in about a half an hour.  The sangria pitchers are pretty tasty, but not overly strong (good or bad depending on your agenda).  I didn't really think any of the tapas were super good, except for the bacon wrapped dates (ordered two of these!) and some times I felt that the waiters were a little annoyed when they wanted to bring you a new dish, but you weren't finished with your previous one.  It felt much more rushed than a tapas style experience should be.  It was really cool that they had the free pintxos platters for yelper check ins though!  I'll definitely come back as several friends really enjoy this place and the tapas menu does have quite a variety!
