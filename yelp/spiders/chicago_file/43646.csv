Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Exactly a minute after our reservation time, they called us on a loud speaker to be seated. I was very impressed with the accuracy in timing here. Most restaurants are usually overbooked and even with reservations you can be stuck waiting more than 30 minutes sometimes. Â However, we approached the hostess and told her they just called us and with a stank look and sassy attitude she just pointed to a co-worker. Manners people. Customer service is the number one rule in hospitality and the hostess is the first and last impression.
