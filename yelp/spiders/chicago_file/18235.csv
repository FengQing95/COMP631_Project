Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you're looking for traditional Chicago deep dish pizza, this is the place! Not only is their pizza good, but they have a beer called the 312. Being a Californian, we enjoy the 805 beer. The 312 holds it's own. It's a wheat beer that's easy drinking. The place filled up quickly, service was great, and atmosphere is loud and family style. Perfect Chicago evening spent here!
