Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This was my first time here and I was very excited to bring my friend with me to celebrate his 40th bday (huge milestone) I called ahead when I made my reservation and let them know we would be celebrating a birthday. I even pre ordered the dessert I wanted for my friend, well my server was never informed. As it was getting later in the evening and I noticed no cake or sparklers were coming to the table I had to fake having to use the restroom to flag my server to save the night. Pretty annoying but he got it done. I guess I wish the experience would have been seamless.
