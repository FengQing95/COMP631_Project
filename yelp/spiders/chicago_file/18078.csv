Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////All we wanted on our recent trip to Chicago was the deep dish pizza. Lou's was recommended by multiple people. When we walked in there was an hour wait, but the restaurant takes your pizza order to get things started. The bar is lively so you can grab a drink while you wait. We were seated earlier than expected and promptly served. The pizza was delicious! The best part was the butter crust which I highly recommend. Overall, if you are vacationing and looking to grab a deep dish head here!
