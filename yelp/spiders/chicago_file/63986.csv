Smoque BBQ////Now THIS is barbeque.  After reading their manifesto on BBQ philosophy on their website I had high expectations, but they were exceeded here.  Everything we had was delicious.  Somebody here is clearly thinking about balance and how the different flavors will harmonize, so the slaw complements the sauce which complements the meat, which goes nicely with the beans, etc.
