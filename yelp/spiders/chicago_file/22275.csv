Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My friends and I shared the Chicago Classic with additional garlic, spinach, and mushrooms, and it ended up being the best deep dish pizza I had ever had. The crust was the perfect density: firm on the bottom, and crunchy on the edges. The sausage was juicy, flavorful, and probably the best sausage on a pizza I've ever tasted. The toppings were arranged well: the sausage was laid out in strips, and every bite was packed with flavor. Mushrooms. Garlic. Sausage. Spinach. Cheeeeeese. Mmmm!
