Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've loved this place been very many times but originally had 5 stars nothing but good things to say about the food. I just called to make a reservation, waited on hold with a very pretentious sounding host one 7 minutes and then he proceeded to hang up the phone. Good food, not worth the service with all the great steak in Chicago.
