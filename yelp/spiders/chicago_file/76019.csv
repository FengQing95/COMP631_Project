Little Goat Diner////Everything on the menu is huge. Come hungry. It is not your typical diner fare. The menu is fun and takes creative inspiration from different cultures. Try it all! Get a group and order the sticky bun. Plus, the bakery attached has amazing baked goods to take home for later on the way out.
