Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The food is absolutely outstanding. The savory portion of the breakfast was perfect. A Denver skillet scramble that had eggs, hash browns, peppers, cheese, onions and ham. Everything was in the perfect portions and it hit the spot. Along with it came a short stack of pancakes. I chose to upgrade to specialty pancakes for $1.00 and chose cinnamon roll pancakes. Jaw dropping. So good. Perfection in every way. If you are coming at a standard breakfast/brunch time, be prepared to wait. It's just part of the deal. They told us an hour wait and it was about 30 minutes. Not bad. Don't get pissy about the wait...be expecting it before you go. But it's totally worth it.
