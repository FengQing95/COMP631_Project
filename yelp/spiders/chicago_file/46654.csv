Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Fast forward to our wedding day on September 2014.  We hosted a lunch wedding reception at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba for 55 guests.  We worked with Alison and Michelle from Catering, Parties & Special Events.  They made it so easy to plan our reception. They answered all of my questions incredibly fast and were so accommodating.  It could not have been any easier.
