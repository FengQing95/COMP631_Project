Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We came here on a Saturday night for date night and it was the perfect place for it! Dim lighting with chandeliers, dark wood panels, and a cool speakeasy vibe make for a great atmosphere. We had late reservations so arrived at 9:30 and the place was hopping with every table filled. Most tables are booths and banquets which make for a cozy clubby feel to the room. We went downstairs for a drink at the bar. It seems to be a combo dining room and bar. The bartender recommended an excellent Cabernet and also did a generous pour of the bubbly rose for the lady!
