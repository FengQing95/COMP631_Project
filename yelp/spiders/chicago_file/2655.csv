The Purple Pig////-Fabulous presentation of two great cuts of pork leg. The chamomile lent itself to the meat in a really interesting way in that it made the flavor of the pork stand out more. The charred cabbage was delicious I could have eaten it in a salad. The sherry Membrillo is a guava reduction and was tangy/sweet, a great compliment to the pork. The bone marrow custard came served in a bone cavity. This was good for spreading onto the meat and gave the leanness some weight.
