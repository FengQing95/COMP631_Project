Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is truly an amazing place. With such a large menu, you would expect that something would be sub par, right? Wrong. Everything is delicious (especially their spicy potatoes). Their brunch and dinner menus boast an impressive array of dishes, and there is definitely something for everyone. It's tapas-style dining is perfect for small and large parties. It never disappoints.
