The Purple Pig////This restaurant not only has poor customer service but their food also tastes like nothing but salt. There were only a few tables when I came in but it took the server forever to come and take my order. I ordered the chicken for the main dish and it was undercooked but nobody came by to check on us. We had to communicate through the busser the whole time. Eventually, I was told that a new dish would be brought out but what I received was the same dish instead only Â it was burnt this time. Please be aware of your customers safety during this pandemic.
