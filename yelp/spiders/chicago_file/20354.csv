Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Service was good, although our server was a little forgetful and we had to remind her a few times.  The place itself is very clean and nicely lit, which I liked.  It has more of a family atmosphere going on.  Lots of professionals during lunch time getting the personal size too.
