Art Institute of Chicago////I love the sculpture garden, although it is small.  One of my other faves is the impressionist collection, of course.  I mean, come on.  This museum has one of the best impressionist collections in the world.  Other fun areas: the Touch Gallery that's fun for kids, and it's near the photography gallery.  They do change stuff up in a lot of the galleries, so if you are looking for your usual Richard Tuttle piece on a certain wall, it might be gone the next time you come back.  The Prints & Drawing area is one of my favorites, as items do get rotated in and out frequently.  A recent discovery of mine is the Thorne Miniature Gallery.  This is an area that a few years ago I really would have said, "Oh, no thank you."  But I walked through recently (and a bit reluctantly) with a friend of mine who is really into that stuff,and it made me appreciate it so much more.  Funny what a new viewpoint can do for you!
