The Purple Pig//// So after the meal was done my husband got out his dad's credit card (which is a subsidiary card under my husband's name) to pay for the meal (as it was supposed to be a "gift" to us for valentine's day) but the credit card wouldn't go through because they card machine they have doesn't have an insert chip function (like wtf?? I've never seen a card machine that doesn't have an insert chip function and is a swipe only) so I ended up having to pull out my credit card to pay. Bill ended up to be $120 with 2 drinks. My husband and I are not very happy about having to pay that much for a REALLY disappointing (and mostly overly salty, which is totally unacceptable for a restaurant that is supposed to be Michelin/Zagat recommended worthy) meal and would never go back there or recommend it to anyone else. I was really hoping to give them a good review and never thought I would have to leave a really bad review for a restaurant but this really ruined our valentine's day. /:
