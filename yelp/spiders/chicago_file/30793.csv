Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We each had a slice of deep dish pizza, specifically par baked deep dish cheese pizza with a butter crust. The cheese was cheesy, the crust was thick and bready, and it was nice and hot. Apparently, they use slices of cheese instead of shredded cheese. I loved the taste of really fresh tomatoes on the pizza! Our food tour guide said they don't use tomato sauce; they use crushed tomatoes.
