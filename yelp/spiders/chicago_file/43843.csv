Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////It would be hard to dislike Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba.  It and Cafe Iberico are the two best-known tapas places in Chicago, so they are often compared.  In the end, though, they're both great places.  I think the service at Ba-Ba-Reeba is slightly better, but then again their prices are at least slightly higher than Iberico.  It used to be that Ba-Ba-Reeba was nicer inside, but with Iberico's latest renovation, I think they're about equal these days.
