Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Been here twice and every time it just gets better and better. The potatoes bravas are things I dream about in my sleep. And the bacon wrapped dates? Yes yum! Sangria is also fantastic and I love the different types. My service has been timely and attentive and the interior decor is so fun! We love the ambiance and often find ourselves wanting to bring our friends here when they visit. It's a must!
