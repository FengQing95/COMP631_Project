Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place is incredible. My husband and I can't stop talking about it. We both love pizza and were both excited and nervous to try Chicago-style deep dish. Our friend took us here, and we loved it. We shared a big salad and the three-cheese bread for appetizers, and both were incredible. I had a personal deep dish with onions, peppers, and the fresh spinach mix and my husband had the Malnati Chicago Classic. So good!! Word of warning - there is quite a wait but you can order your pizza ahead of time so it's ready when you get your table. It was also very hot in the dining room in the back, so dress accordingly.
