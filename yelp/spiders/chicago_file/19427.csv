Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////And this place wasnt half bad at all. I know its one of those place you just have to try if you're from out of town. Not only was I suggested to try this place out, I was told to try a salad. Its not often one hears the praises for salad at a pizza joint but I was intrigued. And while the salad itself was not inspiring.... the salad dressing was! No, I didnt get a bottle to go because I wasnt checking in luggage... but if I had then I would have purchased a bottle or two.
