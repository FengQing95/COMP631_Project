Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Next up - the Grand Tower. The price has actually increased since I first dined there, so I'm not sure if they added some additional items, but I ordered it with 3 friends the first time and we were presented w/2oz of salmon ceviche, about a dozen very large shrimp, and 2 dozen oysters (split between east coast and west coast varieties). The entire tower, as its name implies, is indeed grand. And it was quite a bit of food; it's really enough to share with a group of 6 as a starter. Super fresh, super tasty, and well worth the splurge.
