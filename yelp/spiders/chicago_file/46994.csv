Smoque BBQ////I have heard so much good about Smoque from my family & friends.  I tried it the other day & was quite disappointed.  I had the brisket which was dry & burned.  I then sampled my son's pork sandwich & that was much better & moister.  The cole slaw was not very tasty either. The french fries were pretty good, but very greasy.  I had the worst indigestion that day & into the next day.  Okay service & ready when promised, but afraid I won't be going back here.
