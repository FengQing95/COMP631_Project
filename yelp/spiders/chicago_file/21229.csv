Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm not gonna lie, even though I'm not a fan of deep dish pizza, when in Chicago one must try. It was actually pretty good. We shared a small Chicago classic pizza because we didn't want to get too full. We also ordered beers and a salad to share. Wait takes a while and they ask you to order first because the pizza takes time to make.
