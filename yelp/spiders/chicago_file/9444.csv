Art Institute of Chicago////I did wish that the museum had more historical context - like visually showing us what else was happening when certain pieces were being made. The timeline at the Modern European exhibit's entry does this a little, and sometimes it's mentioned in the piece's text or in the audioguide but I would have liked to SEE it throughout the exhibits. I think I especially wanted this because I wanted to understand which artists were contemporaries with each other, what was happening in the world when the pieces were created, etc. and how much overlap was there between different periods in art.
