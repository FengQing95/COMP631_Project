Little Goat Diner////Needless to say, with a wait time of an hour, the place was bustling and noisy, but not obnoxiously so. We spent our time waiting in the bakery next door, and a rooftop patio is available as well (would have been nice if it wasn't sweltering outside). While waiting, Stephanie walked right by us, which was kind of cool.
