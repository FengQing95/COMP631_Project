Little Goat Diner////Cool location and atmosphere. The server would not make any suggestions on popular or specialty items however their menu is mostly specialty items. I ordered the Elvis Waffles and it was good. The bacon in syrup was awesome. I would order again but I think if you aren't craving something with a sweet kick then don't get this. The wait for lunch was about a half hour but it seemed as though you could call ahead. I would come back again for sure.
