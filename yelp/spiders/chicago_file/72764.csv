Little Goat Diner////Besides Boka, Girl & the Goat is one of my favorite places.  So of course I had to try out Little Goat.  It did not disappoint, so  much so that I returned two other times and even checked out the bakery next door.  Outstanding dishes - corned beef hash (one of the best I've had), fish tacos, goat chili, scones, cookies, and goat milk mocha with marshmallows.  I wish LA had a place like this, or maybe not because I'll get fat!
