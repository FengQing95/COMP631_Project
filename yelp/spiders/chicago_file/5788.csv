The Purple Pig////I was a huuuge fan of the previous location - even though it was small, it was intimate and the ambiance was just amazing. I didn't know they moved half a block down to their new location, so when I finally found it, I was surprised at how big it was! I don't think the ambiance measures up to what it was before, but it was still pretty nice.
