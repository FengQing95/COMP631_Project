Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We started our anniversary celebration with brunch here, I've brought my family and friends here, I've ordered take-out more times than I care to admit and frankly, if it wasn't for this global pandemic, I would've been here almost every weekend. Both brunch and dinner are a total success, the service is always so friendly, the sangrias are spot-on and the ham croquetas? Yeah, I'm the table with at least 3 orders.
