Little Goat Diner////Great place for breakfast! Came in on a Friday morning around 9AM and there was plenty of seating and service was somewhat quick. I got the Dark Chocolate Chip Crunch pancakes and they were amazing! Perfect amount of fluffiness and somehow the chocolate cream that they serve on the side did not overwhelm the dish at all and complimented it quite nicely. We ordered carafes of mimosas for the whole table and the OJ-Champagne ratio was on point. Would definitely come back to try a savory dish for breakfast!
