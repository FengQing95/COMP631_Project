The Purple Pig////LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SPOT! So sad I was living too much in the moment and didn't get pictures of the lamb chops. So I remember the octopus, broccoli, and lamb being amazing. There's a really good wine selection too. The service is great and the overall vibe and ambiance of the spot were awesome. This meal was one of the highlights of my first trip to Chicago. Can't wait to come again!
