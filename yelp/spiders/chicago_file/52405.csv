Smoque BBQ////The Seuss on sauces, I could find at least a dozen either vinegar, molasses or tomato based bottles in the grocery condiment aisle that you'd be going lady gaga over. They offer two, neither has a real kicker that will score a goal unless you're buying off the yelp ref. Interesting, making such a big deal about the Texas style brisket without any traditional sauce. It is closer to being pastrami than having anything to do with Texas. Remind you, this is an extremely subjective area, others will praise the sauces like some fricken fine bottle of wine. They will elaborate on how extraordinary the ordinary is. Oh, I'm sorry, one from each region, how intercontinental insensitive Sam I am. Anyway, I've labeled them thick and thin as opposed to the formally known as Thing 1 and Thing 2. The thicker adds upon the already peppery rub with its own peppy glow while the thinner doesn't stray far, however mildly masked, from tasting just like vinegar. Ironic, the thicker is hiding the vinegar with pepper and then you taste more vinegar than molasses for the thinner. Â Will the real vinegar sauce please stand up? Yep, heavy on the vinegar is more of an acquired taste in this region unless for the few of you that grew up on Russell's and some, not all, will be enlightened on how well it compliments select BBQ. Certainly no HFCS in these babies, good thing since your cholesterol is already shooting off the charts and you wouldn't want to add anything else that is negative. So, you really enjoy going back to places where practically everything on the menu is well over 20% in fat, 50% plus in fanny pack calories.
