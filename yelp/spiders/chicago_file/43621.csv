Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Really cool place! Good for get togethers with friends, dates or family dinners! Went with 2 friends after work and we all split the short rib, brussel sprout salad, spicy potatoes, and stuffed mushroom tapas. Meal also included unlimited bread and olive oil for dipping. What we ordered would have fed 4 although we had 3. We also had a pitcher of the house sangria. The food and ambiance was great. Definitely plan on going back there again
