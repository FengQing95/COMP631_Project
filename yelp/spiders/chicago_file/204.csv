Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////There was a piece of glass in my food this afternoon...I chewed on it, the entire table heard it, i fished around and found it - notified the waitress, and she simply took it away.  We had to ask her to notify the manager, she didnt do speak to him on her own and it took nearly 15 minutes for a manager to come over.  The situation was handled very poorly.  The meal was comped - but that wasnt the point.  Glass in your food is a pretty serious endictment, and they handled it like it was not a big deal.
