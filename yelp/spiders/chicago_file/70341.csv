Little Goat Diner////Anyway, this place is seriously awesome. Â Super fun interior (like Alice and Wonderland meets iHop which somehow resulted in a hip and trendy diner... random, but it totally works), great staff with excellent recommendations (which you should ask for and take b/c they have never steered us wrong before!), and INCREDIBLE food in portions big enough to feed a small village without the price tag you'd expect from a place this popular.
