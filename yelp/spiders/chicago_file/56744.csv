Smoque BBQ////My girl friends and I arrived around 5:30 PM on a weeknight, and there was a constant steady flow of patrons.  You order at the counter, seat yourself, and pick up your order when your number is called.  This minimizes costs by not having to tip a waiter - bonus!  We also brought in a 6-pack of beer w/o being charged a corkage fee - another bonus!  And we parked in the lot for free - bonus again!!
