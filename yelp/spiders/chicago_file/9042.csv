Art Institute of Chicago////Whenever I'm in Chicago I have to go to the Art Institute. I love this museum so much! It's right up there with The Met. The collection of American art is fabulous. Plus, the miniature rooms are one of my favorite things. Very interesting and fun to explore! Defintiely recomend!
