Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////order.  I always order the avocado salad it's light and yummy.  A must order is any of the seafood tower dishes.  Can one really ever have to much seafood? Freshest oysters on the Midwest.  Oysters and champagne puts me in a special mood.  I don't really eat meat but I did taste the steak and OMG I must say it was like Butta!!  I also don't usually the elote corn but their side of corn was ahhhmazing!! In fact all of the sides are ahhmazing!! You could go there and just order the sides and be completely satisfied.  My last visit was my bd and friends bought me a cake and the service for our large party was top notch!!  If you can still fit dessert somewhere close your eyes and pick any two!! You won't be dissatisfied.
