Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is a perfectly fine restaurant, but I don't really get what the big deal is. People wait and wait at this place for...what? Mediocre tapas and overpriced booze? I know I'm in the minority because, apparently, everyone else LOVES this joint. I just don't think it's that amazing, and it's certainly not worth waiting for a table.
