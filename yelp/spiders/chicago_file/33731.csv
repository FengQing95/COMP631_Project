Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////No, I do not normally write like this; l generally save hyperbole of this extent for sarcastic purposes.  I don't even usually go out of my way to write reviews on Yelp rather than in my personal journal or occasionally in a blog.  This place, however, really /moved me/ in a way few meals ever have. Inspirational - my highest compliments to the chef and to everyone. Thank you all.
