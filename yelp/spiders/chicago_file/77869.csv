Little Goat Diner////Breakfast is served all day and there is a wide selection of drinks. I would definitely want to try out the drinks next time.  This time I did the breakfast and ordered the This Little Piggy Went to China.  It was a sesame cheddar biscuit with Szechuan pork sausage and a chili garlic chive sauce.  There was also a fried egg on top.  It was delicious but the numbness of the Szechuan pork sausage was strange for me.  I had a hot yet cold feeling on my tongue that was too much for me.  The flavor profile is very complex and tasty though.  I would want to try something a little less exotic next time so I can handle it better lol.  Overall a fun and exciting dining adventure :)
