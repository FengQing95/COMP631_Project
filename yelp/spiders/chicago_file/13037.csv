Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Excellent Chicago-style deep dish pizza. We loved the pizza; however, my family says they like Uno's slightly better. Chicago related memorabilia on the walls. Good food for locals or tourists. Be prepared to wait but you can order your pie when you put in your name so the wait after being seated is short. Try the Family Sized Malnati's Salad with all the stuff on it - it's great! Overall, we will return if it's nearby but will go to Uno's if we're near there.
