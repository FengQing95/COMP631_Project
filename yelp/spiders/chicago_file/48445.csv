Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Im from CA, i was visiting and a few friends and i wanted to venture the city before our flight back home the next day! So we came across this place on yelp and decided to check it out... OMG. we got 2 pitchers between 4 ppl and we were pretty much buzzin it hard ... the appetizers were perfectly portioned and kept us sane. Once i stood up it was pretty much over lol
