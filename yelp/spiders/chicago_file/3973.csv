The Purple Pig////JLT - It was basically an open faced BLT sandwich with layers of pork jowl, tomato, and frisee, topped with a fried egg. The meat was insanely tender for how lean it was. The frisee was dressed with a great pesto aioli that gave it a caesar salad type taste. Overall a very solid dish. Â
