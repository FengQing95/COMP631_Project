Little Goat Diner////Goat chilli and cheese and fries.  Yes.  Spicy of the chilli was mild, which I could have gone for more kick.  But then again I spent many years in Texas.  I liked that the goat was rough ground, so it still was a bit meaty and chunky as oppose to ground up so much that it would be like any other ground red meat.  So to me it was much more like a chilli con Carne.
