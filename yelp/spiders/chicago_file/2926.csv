The Purple Pig////Plates are meant to be shared, so the more people you bring the more things you get to try! I always get the roasted bone marrow; it is incredibly decadent. My other favorites are the octopus with salsa verde, crispy pig's ears, turkey leg confit and grilled broccoli (not any ordinary broccoli, it is served with an anchovy vinaigrette that is SO good!).
