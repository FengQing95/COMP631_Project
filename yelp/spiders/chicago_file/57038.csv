Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Everybody knows that CBBR is a happening spot. I'm not sure if it's because it fosters the kind of camaraderie that is only forged when you share too-small amounts of delicious food, or the drinks. Seriously, though, you only have to show up most any night to see that there are a whole slew of people who had the same idea you did: eat good food with good friends, and have a great time.
