Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The staff is very friendly and you are allowed to take frozen pizzas to go. It is limited to only cheese and pepperoni from what I was told and I oddly had some friends who wanted me to bring frozen pizzas to LA. Since I'm such an amazing friend I did put it in my luggage the same day. I wonder how it tasted, LOL!
