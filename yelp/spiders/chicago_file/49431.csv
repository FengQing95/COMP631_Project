Smoque BBQ////Just order ribs and do not mess around with their sandwiches. Ribs are the way to go there. Very soft and smoky flavored  - they are as good as ribs can be.  For 2 people just get a Full Slab of St Luis Ribs and 2 sides that goes with it for free. That will be plenty for a dinner. Do not order any more additional sides. Their sides are nothing special.
