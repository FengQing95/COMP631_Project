Art Institute of Chicago////The people of Chicago should be proud of their art institute. It really offers up a great variety of art and artifacts for everyone. I'll be honest, I gave myself 3 hours for this museum, which I figured would give me enough time before I ran out of gas. That was a mistake. I didn't do enough recon and thus spent a lot of time meandering through the Asian art wing. Before I knew it, an hour was gone and I realized that I'd only seen a small proportion of the museum. I picked up the pace, caught the Impressionists, and boom, another hour gone. Now I had only one hour left to try to see as much as possible. Thus the running shoes. I ended up having to just snap pictures of a lot of the artwork so I could take my time to look at them later. Luckily, I was able to see the Chagall windows right as they were ushering people out the door. The artwork here spanned from the ancient Egyptians all the way to modern and contemporary art. It's hard to believe they could cram all that into one museum.
