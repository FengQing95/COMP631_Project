Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great Place. Period. Came here for GF's birthday on Halloween and I'm glad I chose this particular spot. I called in a reservation because the place looked totally booked on-line (for good reason). The ambiance is very romantic (especially downstairs). It worked perfectly for the birthday date, but I would definitely come back just to hangout at the bar. All of the servers, hostesses and bartenders were courteous and accommodating. Not only did everyone know it was a birthday celebration, but the server Barbara knew what I was drinking at the bar upstairs and offered me the same drink at the table (these little things go a long long way). BTW, I was drinking the "Dark and Stormy". I don't usually go for rum drinks but this was delicious (I must have had at least 3....) Service was also on point. Genuine conversation and nobody was overbearing. We had the crab cake, the filets with a bunch of sides and the mango sherbet. The GF was extra excited about the crab cake and said it was the best she ever had (she travels a lot so I'll take her word for it :)) Definitely mostly crab and minimal cake. Steak wasn't exactly medium-rare but we did not make a fuss about it because it was still very good.
