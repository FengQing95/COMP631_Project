Little Goat Diner////This place was a random choice for us as it was our first morning ever in Chicago as were visiting from Miami. Let me just say, we were so impressed! We walked in not knowing you needed reservations and it was very packed! The hostess was quick to say no worries! And say us down right away!! Everyone was sooooo kind! We were served fast and it was all sooooo delicious! Definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone!
