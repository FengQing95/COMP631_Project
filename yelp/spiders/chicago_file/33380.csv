Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our waiter was great.  Very personable and remembered the birthday. I usually get the steak frites but instead opted for the filet with a a side of frites.  The filet was terrible. It had clearly been sitting under a heat lamp as the crust was lukewarm. It tasted like butter and had an odd consistency.  It was also much fattier than a filet should be. The fries even tasted a little different than they usually do, but were still pretty good. They got rid of the whiskey ice-cream, another bummer.
