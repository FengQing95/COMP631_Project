Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Wonderful locale for girls night out. Sangria gives me a headache but if you like it then you will really like this place. My friends rave about the Sangria. I'll stick to my margarita. I love how you can really order one of everything on the menu here. It is fun to try a little bit of everything. It was also nice that they had veggie options which is not always easy in a tapas restaurant. If you are looking for a quiet evening, then this is not your space. This Cafe is energetic, loud and ready for a good time.
