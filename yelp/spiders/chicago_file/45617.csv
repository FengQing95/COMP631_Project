Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great place to chill over a few drinks and enjoy some delicious tapas. Went here with some friends for dinner and had a great time. I loved the Christmas lights hanging across the ceiling and the fact that you could see outside without actually being outside (aka mauled by bugs). Would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone.
