Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I rarely go to restaurants more than once... I would come back here every day! Tapas is the BEST way to do it. Most authentic Spanish tapas I've ever had (and I can say that because I've lived in Spain)! Drooling just thinking about the food. Highly recommend! Ordered a total of 8 tapas for 3 of us and was perfect amount of food. We started with 5 and ordered a few more because we couldn't get enough food. Atmosphere is loud, but it's very enjoyable. The food comes out faster than any place I've ever been! Sangria pitcher is a great deal as well. I'd recommend making a reservation because I did, but we still waited about 8 minutes. There was a group that did not and I over heard they were waiting for a while. Lettuce entertain you restaurant, so there are added benefits to spending money here. Price was pretty moderate.
