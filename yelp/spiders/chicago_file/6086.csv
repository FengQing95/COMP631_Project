The Purple Pig////All the meat dishes were very tender and the vegetable dishes were really nice too. It was one of the best broccoli dishes I have tried! The pork belly was a bit fatty, but it was soft and well cooked. The pork shoulder was meaty and the gravy, mashed potato and meat all went very well together.
