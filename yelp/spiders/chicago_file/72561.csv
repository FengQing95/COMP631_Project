Little Goat Diner////For dessert we tried the chocolate cake (it was a special that night), and the caramel/chocolate tart thing.  OMG.  We tried so hard to eat all of the food and we were stuffed.  Amazing.  I would highly recommend coming here if you're visiting Chicago from out of town and want a fun experience.  (Actually, I'd recommend coming here.  Period.)
