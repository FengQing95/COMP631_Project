Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place was awesome. We had the Brussel sprout salad, spicy potatoes, ham and cheese croquettes and the bacon wrapped dates. Â Everything we had was delicious. 4 plates was more than enough food for 2 people. I also had the butterscotch custard dessert, so good. Still thinking about it. Great atmosphere.
