Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We went here with a large group - 12 people, all vegetarian.  We had plenty to eat, lots of variety of plates and desserts, which all came out quickly and in intervals.  Plus a ton of sangria that was just right, not overly sweet and not bitter...  After all of this delicious food, we only paid $18 per person!  Call way ahead if you have a large reservation, though - I called on Tuesday for a Saturday reservation and we had to eat at 10pm!
