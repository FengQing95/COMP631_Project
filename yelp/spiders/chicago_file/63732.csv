Smoque BBQ////It's hard to find a good bbq place in Chicago, and this one it just that. Their brisket is some of the best I've had yet. I don't like ribs so I've never had it, but my boyfriend always gets it and loves it. The place can get pretty packed, so don't plan on going during peak hours. Parking is decent, we've always parked behind the place.
