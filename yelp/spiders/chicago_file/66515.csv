Little Goat Diner////Yes, the wait is long because it's fabulous, but if you go with your expectations in check it won't be bothersome.  They text you and you can check updates on your wait time and grab a drink or whatever so it's still a positive experience.  I'd only recommend going if you're prepared for that, or if you don't want to wait as long just go at a uncommon time.
