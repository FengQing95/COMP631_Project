Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It was busy when we got there but luckily we snagged a spot by the bar. The bartender was super nice and helpful with suggestions. We got an app, a half and half and a free dessert with our yelp checkin. Over all it was all really good. Although probably not the best deep dish I've ever had. But it was solid. And I did really love that the crust had a really good crunch to it. I do have a different place I like better...but we won't start that debate.
