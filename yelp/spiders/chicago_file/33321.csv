Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This review is long overdue.  We eat at Bavette's in April while visiting Chicago and had selected the restaurant based on it's wonderful Yelp reviews.  Bavette's didn't disappoint.  A dark club atmosphere with a neat vibe that is relaxing and not stiff.  The steaks were nothing short of exceptional and we loved the dipping sauces and steak salt to go with.  If you are used to the big chain steakhouses, this is a totally different and unique experience that is a must try.  We are still talking about our dinner at Bavette's two months later.
