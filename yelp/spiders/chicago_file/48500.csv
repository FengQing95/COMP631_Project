Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I researched ahead of time for "best restaurants for families," and to their credit, Reeba's "healthy" kids menu, and kids play kit was great. The red wine flight was great, three smaller glasses of wine for $16, was perfect for my wife and I (we each got a flight). Food was good, not great. The goat cheese dish was glorified marinara sauce and garlic bread, pass on that. The hangar steak, melon and purity-piri dishes were very good. The best dish of the night was the bananas foster dish. Perfectly sized, and very, very tasty. Overall, very positive experience, and it was nice to get out of downtown Chicago.
