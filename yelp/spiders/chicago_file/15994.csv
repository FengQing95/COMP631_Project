Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my first experience tasting authentic Chicago Deep Dish and it was HEAVEN! The butter crust was so amazing the entire bottom layer of Italian sausage was genius. The sauce had great flavor. This pizza was so great I had it three times during my weeklong visit to Chicago. Can't wait until next time!
