Art Institute of Chicago////That first visit so inspired the 12-year-old me that I went back home to Michigan, found a canvas and watercolors, dashed off a skyline painting of Chicago, and I took it to a small hippie gallery in town. They sold it for $7.50. Maybe your youngsters will have the same inspiration. I only hope they can take their art career a little further than I did. At least I still have the snapshots.
