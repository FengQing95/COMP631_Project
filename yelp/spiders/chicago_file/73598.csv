Little Goat Diner////Littel Goat is my second favorite Izard restaurant but its style and quality make it an easy 5 star joint! Like Girl & the Goat and Duck Duck Goat, Izard masterfully works in unique ingredients that will simply "Wow" you. A diner in name and ethos this is, but there is nothing plain and simple about it. Come for the giant goat burger and return for the amazing milkshakes:)
