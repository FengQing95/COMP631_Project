Smoque BBQ////I went here a couple years ago before my most recent visit here tonight and i have to say that this time around my experience was much better! Some notable options are getting the cornbread, pecan bread pudding over the peach cobbler, and bbq beans were ok and avoid the coleslaw! Furthermore, I really like the 1/2 pulled pork and 1/2 brisket sandwiches over the baby back ribs because they were moist, had more flavor and were more tender. The ribs were not fall off the bone-some parts wasn't as soft as id like it to be and reminds me of dry-rubbed ribs i can get elsewhere which might be the reason they lack more flavor because you have to apply either the side of Memphis style sauce or Carolina style BBQ sauces they give ya...Happy to have made it here just before 7pm so there was a short line. It dont know when they started having you order even before they allow you to sit down but i kinda like the line management and the bus boy clearing off tables right away to allow additional seating. Service was quick considering the turn out and woman at register was very nice!
