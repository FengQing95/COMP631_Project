Little Goat Diner////We've eaten there several times and also had drinks. The best thing about the place are the Bloody Mary with the stuffed olive. The service was terrible as they said we canceled our reservation when we were sitting at the bar for two hours. The food we have at home is much better. Way overhyped and not worth the absorbent prices. We'll never go back.
