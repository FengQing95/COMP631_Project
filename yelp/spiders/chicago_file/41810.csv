Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ba-Ba-Reeba is a solid place to go to get a meal. It's not the best place but it's definitely a crowd pleaser. I just would never ever attempt to go in the evening. That would be crazy. I prefer to go in the early afternoon or on the weekend for like brunch or a late lunch. The olive plate is so good. My date liked his solomillo, we shared patatas ,some other dishes and a bottle of wine. It was like $80 bucks. Not bad, not great. It's an old stand by that you can go to and be sure you leave with a smile.
