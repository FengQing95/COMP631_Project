Art Institute of Chicago////I love this museum. It houses an incredibly well curated collection with many masterpieces. The architecture here is wonderful. Each space is clearly delineated, from the classical European arts to the contemporary space. You will know where you are based on the design of the space. All the floors are connected only on the first floor. If you get lost, ask anyone at the information booths.
