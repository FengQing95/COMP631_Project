Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////What can I say, a first time deep dish eater, the sauce and sausage were amazing. The crust was crunchy and the cheese gushed out like it does in commercials. The staff and waitress were absolutely amazing. I even tried the salad, with italitan salami bacon bit things...needless to say I am a tourist, I haven't had all the deep dish Chicago has to offer, but this was the best possible way to be introduced!
