Smoque BBQ////My husband & I can't agree - I love the brisket & he loves the ribs.  He's not a big red meat eater & I've never seen him eat so many ribs in one sitting.  The food is great and the service is exceptional.  One of the owners is always available and helpful.  This is the best thing to hit Old Irving Park in a while.
