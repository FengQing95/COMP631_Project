Smoque BBQ////Don't let the website fool you.  This is somewhere between BBQ pit and hole-in-the-wall.  In the best possible way.  Everything we had was great - my favorite was the brisket but the pulled pork, ribs and chicken were all perfectly cooked, heavily seasoned, and most definitely fork-tender.  The mac & cheese was deliciously cheesy and fired on top and served in an adorable little foil ramekin.  And the best of all - the sauce!  The vinegar BBQ sauce has a heavy dose of smoky, sweet and sour, in just the right proportions.
