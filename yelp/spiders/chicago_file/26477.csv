Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////'The Lou' pizza was really good. I would recommend this. Eating deep dish pizza was one of the to-do things in our list while traveling to Chicago. But unfortunately our server was a grumpy man which ruined our experience. He wasn't polite and we weren't given same treatment as his other customers. Food is great here but not service.
