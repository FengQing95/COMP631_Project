Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great spot for tapas! You'd think that small dishes aren't filling, but you get 2-3 and it becomes a full meal! I had the Wagyu Beef Carpacchio (truffle and oil overpowered the meat a bit), deviled egg (no complaints here), and chorizo wrapped dates (probably the best I've had- the salty and sweet balance out quite well). I also had the red sangria which ended up getting watered down as my ice melted (but I think that's more my fault). I checked into Yelp to get the free dessert tapas, the chocolate truffle cake (very rich, but small enough portion where it's not too overwhelming). All in all, everything was delicious for a good price!
