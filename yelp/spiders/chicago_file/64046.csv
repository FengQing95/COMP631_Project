Smoque BBQ////Tasty, but it was really just OK, I wasn't like blown out of my socks, sorry. I love BBQ, and can recall Smalls first then Dino BBQ as being some of the best in recent memory, but this was not as good I thought. But just like a fraction of a percent off from Dino. Real good BBQ to me is Memphis or Texas.
