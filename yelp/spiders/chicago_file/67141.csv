Little Goat Diner////+How is the coffee? I got the Little Goat coffee. Espresso with goat milk and whipped cream and a caramel drizzle. Was good, but the large had way too much milk to espresso ratio (you'll need at least 3 shots if you get the large, as the standard offered is only 2). And the goat milk does have a distinct flavor, so if you're into chevre, go for it!
