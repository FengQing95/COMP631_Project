Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Wait time wasn't bad, but this may have had to do with the holiday and coming earlier in the evening (around 6pm). To be honest, I'm not sure what to think of the interior and decor -- not sure if they are going for old school italian, sports bar or dirty. Having lived in NYC, we decided to try both the deep dish and the thin crust. The deep dish was NOT worth the 45 minute wait -- I'm not sure if the pizza had sat out for a while, but it tasted like they had baked the crust, sauce and cheese separately. Although fresh, the pizza looked like it came out of a refrigerator.
