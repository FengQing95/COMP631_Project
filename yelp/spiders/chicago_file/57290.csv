Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////So we went for our anniversary for dinner. After being seated we waited almost 10 minutes for our server to greet us. Server was actually very good and engaging with good recommendations. Unfortunately the salmon special was pretty bad and then at the end of the meal  we weren't even offered dessert or a dessert menu. At first I thought it was because they were going to  surprise us with a anniversary dessert but the check was delivered and 10 minutes later to get the checked process still no acknowledgement of the special occasion. Very disappointing for such a reputable restaurant group.
