Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This used to be great place to eat. I hadn't been there in about 3yrs,but always had a great memory of the place. I went last night without a reservation so we waited at the bar and noticed we could place are food order there as well. I was content to remain at the bar,but the wife complained about the hard seat,so I settled the bill and we were given a table. Â The server was not happy and basically ignored us.
