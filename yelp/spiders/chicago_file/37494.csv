Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This time around we relished on the oyster tray (4 types of oysters, 2 east coast and 2 west coast - and you get 3 oysters of each type so 12 oysters total). All were delicious. Would recommend the champagne sauce on the east coast oysters as those are saltier than the west coast oysters.
