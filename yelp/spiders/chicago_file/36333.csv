Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Near the end of the meal, we were trying to get the waiter's attention to bring us more drinks and look at the dessert menu, but he was busy busing tables and talking to other patrons?  Kind of annoying, especially when there are 5 men at a table.  If you're going to drop $1000 for dinner, you shouldn't need to wait for your waiter to bus tables.
