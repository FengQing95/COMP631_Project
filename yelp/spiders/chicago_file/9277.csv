Art Institute of Chicago////1. This place is awesome. There's so much to do here and I swear you will need all day just to look at everything. The museum alone is beautiful with very nice architecture. The only downfall is that they close so early, I believe we started our tour at 4:00pm and they close at 6:00pm which didn't leave us with very much time to even get through the whole thing. There were also parts of the museum that were under renovation... I need to come back here to explore!
