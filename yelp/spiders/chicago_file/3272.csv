The Purple Pig////I really wanted to love this place after so many people had urged me to go.... but in the end, I wouldn't bother to write home about it unfortunately! Yes, it was a busy Saturday night so I tend to cut restaurants a little slack for that but it was truly a comedy of mis-steps and errors!
