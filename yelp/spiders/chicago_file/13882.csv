Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My hubby and the in laws love this place so I really hope they're not reading this. This place inspired my to make an I don't get it list on yelp. For me, the pizza here has too much sauce, the cheese is too thick and hard, and the toppings are a bit skimpy. I like the end of the crust where I can really taste the cornmeal and it's nice and crispy, but on the bottom it's often soggy. I enjoy the salad here but should I really like the salad more than the pizza? Please tell me what I'm missing about this place.
