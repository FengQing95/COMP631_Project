Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////All in all tapas are never cheap, though with the right orders, along with plenty of complimentary bread and olive oil, you can actually get fairly full without breaking the bank. We averaged around $12/person on just food, and with drinks it just brought it a little higher, which is not bad at all. Also, they knew it was our first time there, so they even brought us out a trio of desserts, on the house, which was a great way to end the meal and start off the night. For that and their happy hour, they are definitely warrant another half star(4.5/5)
