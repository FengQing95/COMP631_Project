Little Goat Diner////I came here for lunch a couple of weeks ago and very much enjoyed the meal. They do have a menu at the hostess stand with gluten free items marked. As other reviewers have noted they also have items which may contain gluten on this list so just make sure you're aware which is which and pick for your personal comfort level.
