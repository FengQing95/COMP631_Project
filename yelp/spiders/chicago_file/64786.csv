Smoque BBQ////A couple co-workers talked about this place, so I finally had lunch there.  I ordered a sliced brisket sandwich with a side of Mac and Cheese and peach cobbler for dessert.  Then stood by the door and waited for a table because all the seats were taken.  A host sat me a few minutes later when a table became available.  A few minutes later my name was called, I went to the counter and retrieved my meal on a tray.
