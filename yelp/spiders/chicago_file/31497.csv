Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////A very busy place. We came during what seemed like the busiest time of day (5p). You can preorder your pizza while you wait. When they call your name for a table, your pizza is started. The pizza making process takes about 30 min after its put in, so you don't have too long to wait once you're seated. We came here twice and we sat at the bar the first time. Each experience was great! The bar atmosphere was friendly and really busy. It's like being behind the scenes where all the action is.
