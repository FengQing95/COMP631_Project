Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband and I were in town for our anniversary. The minute we walked in to this place we loved the speakeasy atmosphere. Excellent, attentive and informed service. The bourbon drinks and steaks were perfection. Overall a wonderful experience. We are planning another trip to Chicago soon..this restaurant reservation is first on our list!!
