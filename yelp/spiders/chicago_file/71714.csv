Little Goat Diner////I assure you this is not a misguided review as a result of my sugar deprivation the previous month. Little Goat is da bomb. I started my meal with The Little Goat, a latte made with goat's milk that was a little funky, and therefore probably better for the more adventurous eater, but overall delicious. He went the alcohol route with the Russian Goat, which was "decent." I think he regretted not getting a coffee beverage like mine, which was more unique and cheaper. We then shared the parathas burrito which was wow and the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes. Though I'm a chocolate fanatic, I actually think I liked the parathas burrito more. It was unique, delicious, and the *perfect* brunch item. The pancakes were more just like your normal chocolate chip pancakes but were nice and fluffy and came with yummy chocolate whipped butter deliciousness on the side.
