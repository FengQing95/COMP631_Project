Smoque BBQ////I had heard this place has Chicago's best bbq. It's got to be pretty damn good if it caught Guy Fieri's attention. I had to come find out for myself! The BBQ was phenomenal and the sauce was delicious! The folks who run this place know the art of BBQ and just because the doors close at a certain time in the evening doesn't mean these people aren't still hard at work perfecting their craft. Even the cole slaw was delicious! Freaking cole slaw! The most basic side dish ever and this place got me to actually love a cole slaw! They do have their own parking that's available at a certain time in the day and there's lots of street parking in the area. The service was excellent and very attentive! You won't be disappointed checking this place out. Make sure you come with an appetite and enjoy!
