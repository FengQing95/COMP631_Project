Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm giving two stars because last time I was in Chicago I ordered Lou's and it was amazing. Tonight was terrible. My pizza was rock hard and uncut, which would have been ok if they had sent a knife and fork. They did not so now I'm in a hotel room with a salad I can't eat and a pizza I can barely bite. Was hoping dessert would be a win but my cookie is still raw. Guess I'm saving calories and wasting money, never again.
