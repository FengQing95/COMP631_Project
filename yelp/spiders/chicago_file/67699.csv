Little Goat Diner////The next day I had my friends meet me at the diner and we unfortunately did not enjoy our experience as much. It was only the second day it opened so understandably there were a lot of kinks and some service errors. We were happy to overlook that but the food that came out did not impress any of us. We tried the eggs benedict (came out cold), the fat club (boring), duck sandwich (decent) and tuna melt (ok but covered in olives). They were all just ok which is not what I expect after waiting an hour to be seated and knowing how wonderful the bakery and Girl and the Goat both are. The one item we did all love was the crab dip but it came with about half as many crackers as you would need for all the dip so we had to ask for more, twice.
