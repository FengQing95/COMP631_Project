Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////If I could give Bavette's 10 stars I would.. the food was out of this world. The steaks were cooked perfectly and the presentation of everything was top notch. The atmosphere was intimate and classy. And the waitstaff was so kind and informative. We recently visited for an anniversary and they were so kind wishing us a happy anniversary multiple times and even giving us a sea salt carmel ice cream sunday after our meal. We will be back sooner than later!!!
