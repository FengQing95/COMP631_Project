Little Goat Diner////Overall, a very solid place considering its randolph location. My advice if you want to go is to go on a weeknight an hour or so before closing (around 9) and you shouldnt have any trouble getting in. This is also a great back-up if you're waiting in too long of a line at one of the other randolph restaurants (we had originally wanted to go to Au Cheval)
