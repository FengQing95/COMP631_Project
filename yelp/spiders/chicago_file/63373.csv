Smoque BBQ////Had the St Louis ribs ---excellent and full of meat and not at all dry. The mac and cheese seemed a little grainy and not creamy. That was a let down, but the rest was just excellent. Get the corn bread because it's just so good and crumbly. The fries actually were good ---thick and crispy like the ones at Five Guys, and they go well with the ribs. Turns out the cole slaw comes with the ribs already, so that didn't count as a side. But the slaw, while fresh, could have used a little more wetness --as in some creaminess (mayo). However, the crunch of the cabbage added to the nice texture experience of the meal. I liked the bbq sauce a lot, but would have also welcomed a spicier one. Finally, I couldn't leave without the peach cobbler, which I enjoyed later that night. I like how they prepare all of their sides in these little pie containers. So practical. Smoque rocks.
