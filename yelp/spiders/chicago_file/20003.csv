Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Malnati Classic was thick layer of cheese on top of the crust then sausage on top then tomato sauce. My favorite part was the crust. I thought the pizza was very bland. Only the tomato sauce added extra flavor to the pizza. I liked the thick cheese but even that didn't have much flavor. Then when it got cold it was just a thick layer of unmelted cheese, which wasn't that great.
