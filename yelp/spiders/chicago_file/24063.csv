Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As a new yorker thin foldable pizza will always be my preference but when in Chicago home of the deep dish there is only one way to go LOU MALNATI'S. this pizza is very tasty and filling. We ordered the Lou and the Malnati's. Both pizza's were delicious.regret not getting a larger pie as the personal seemed a bit small. Great service. Make sure you go with ample time as it takes about 45 mins to make a pizza.
