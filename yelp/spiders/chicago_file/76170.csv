Little Goat Diner////I got a Sloppy Goat (just like a Sloppy Joe), and apple cream soup. Both were pretty decent. Although I found my Sloppy Goat a little salty, maybe that's just the way they are? They have so many other breakfast items on the menu that I really wanted to try, definitely will visit Little Goat again next time.
