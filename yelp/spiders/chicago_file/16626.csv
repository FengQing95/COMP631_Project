Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's Deluxe Deep Dish Pizza:  The presentation of the dish itself produced high praise and fright.  From the visual perception alone, the monstrosity that is to be my lunch overwhelmed any conscious dieting efforts.  For starters, the simple thickness of the Pizza resembled that of 5 thin crust slices stacked upon one another.  Still, despite my inherent dieting nature to turn away from such a decree, I indulged.  The taste...  Despite the burdensome corpulent nature of the Pizza, the balance (despite it's hearty portion) was exactly what was needed for such a "casserole" inspired application.  Digging into Lou Malnati's Deep Dish was comparable to that of eating a meatloaf with a butter crusted piece of bread on the bottle.  The overwhelming, but pleasantly, enjoyable, pizza was one in which the mightiest of eaters can only consume but so much of a good thing.  I opted to cop out @ 2  1/2 slices, my ordinary thin crust consumption would be the entire pie.  Much tasty, much preferred indeed!
