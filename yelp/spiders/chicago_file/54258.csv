Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////What else is there to say that others' haven't already said? Nothing! The staff is friendly, warm, and patient (lots of groups eat here, and probably have a hard time deciding between all of the dishes).  Tried the paella for the first time - wow that is a huge dish. For 2 people, you could order that, and maybe 1-2 other small things.  We ordered 5 small plates, and paella (which takes a while to make), and took most of the paella home.  Heated up as leftovers a few days later, it was still really good! Come here with your family, friends, ladies night out, birthday parties, pajama brunch, whatever.  There will be at least a few things on the menu that each person in your party will enjoy.
