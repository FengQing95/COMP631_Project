Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. I've been coming here for years and have always had a good experience. These are the must haves in my opinion. The crispy potatoes as well as the garlic potatoes. The curried chicken salad the goat cheese in tomato sauce and the sherry meatballs and the bacon wrapped dates. The desserts are delicious especially the chocolate and the tres leches. The desserts are way too small in my opinion. I get that they are tapas but that's just too small for me and annoying. Â and I will say that I wasn't impressed with the more expensive dishes on the menu. The streak is nothing special in my opinion and neither is the chicken skewers. So I usually stick with my favorites and that is more than enough. It can be overly crowded at times and it's hard to get a table as a walk in on weekends. I'm not crazy about the personality of the host who always greets us. She can be rude sometimes and as the first face we see at the restaurant she should be way more friendly.
