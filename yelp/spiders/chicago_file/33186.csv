Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Ambiance is great, flat iron steak OK, but the service... is AWFUL. It took forever for our beverages to arrive, not to mention how long we had to wait fot the apps and entrees. But the most unbelievable thing is that I had my HAIR BURNED DOWN by the small candles they have right behind the seats downstairs (what a DUMB place to put candles, come on)! Â I asked for the manager, Ms. Annie A., who just said she believed in me (really? anyone could smell what just had happened). The bathroom downstairs is really dark so I couldn't see how bad it was and I'm really upset for paying a $100 bill for having OK food, slow service and a ruined hair.
