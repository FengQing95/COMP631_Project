Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It's clear Bavette's has a very demanding kitchen team already from the bread - served in almost comically large hunks with a firm crust and a moist, soft interior reminiscent of the fresh bread from the wood-fire ovens in Italy. Fight the temptation to gorge yourself on the entirety of your bread, there is more marvelous food to come. The Pepper Duck and Goat Cheese Terrine was a ruby-pink affair with great texture, accompanied by a well-spiced chutney that almost gave it the notes of barbeque sauce. The friend chicken, which we had heard accolades of, was crisp to perfection but was steaming and soft inside. A minute less, and the meat near the bone would have been a light pink, so the cooking point was just right. The creamed spinach, in the classic American fashion, was a lot more "cream" than "spinach," making it a delicious indulgence, although the blue cheese in it was not very prominent. Another side, a baked sweet potato slathered with butter and brown sugar, was almost creamy soft inside, and the addition of the brown sugar made it all the more special.
