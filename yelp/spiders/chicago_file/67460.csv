Little Goat Diner////We asked the waitress about the taste, and she said that is just how it tastes because the hash browns are done one after another on the grill and the oil builds up. We could not eat more than 3/4 of it because the aftertaste (and during-taste) was that bad. Unfortunately, there was no offer to change it out for a different dish. In the future, I would recommend asking customers if they would like to change a dish out if they appear unsatisfied with it.
