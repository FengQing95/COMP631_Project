Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Holy moly the steak was so soft and flavorful! It took me by surprise my first bite. I never had a steak quite that soft before. The steak is pricey but you can definitely share it, which is what I did and it was well more than enough food especially with all the sides. I would probably recommend you getting 1 side as the serving size is pretty big. The 3 sides I got to try were decent.. I wish I tried the mashed potatoes or the corn. They looked delicious! The steak was definitely the shining star.
