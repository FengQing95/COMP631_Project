Little Goat Diner////It was okay. Â It's more of fusion of everything. Most of food are on little bit greasy side. It's good place for hanging out with friends but definitely not a place for with your date. It's pretty fast pace restaurant so if you are looking for restaurant where you can eat and chat for little bit, I would recommend someplace else. There's a long line and always packed. So it's better to go there early if you don't want to wait in long line.
