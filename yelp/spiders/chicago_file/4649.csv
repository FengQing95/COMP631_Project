The Purple Pig////We were at a two-top table and were quickly greeted by our server, who explained the menu and made some recommendations. Their menu has so many great options!  We opted for a variety of dishes to share, including chorizo-stuffed olives, deep-fried egg, fava bean purée, crispy pigs ears, secreto (smoked pork dish), and lamb and pork kefedes.
