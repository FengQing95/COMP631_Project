Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had a reservation for 6:30pm on Saturday and still had to wait a good amount of time to be seated. The queuing and pre-order area was a mess (they really need someone wrangling this process and letting fewer customers into the front portion of the restaurant...the crowd I experienced was a fire hazard FOR SURE). I was tempted to turn around and walk out but I am glad I stuck it out. Once we were seated, things felt much more relaxed.
