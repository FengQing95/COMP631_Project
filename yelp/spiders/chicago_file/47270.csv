Smoque BBQ////Smoque gets 5 stars because it is in IL, I would give it 4 if we were further south but as I look outside I am reminded we are NOT.  For BBQ in IL this place it absolutely Delicious.  It is perfect to rid yourself of that craving for you most favorite BBQ place, mine would be in Kansas City.  Everything I had was wonderful, and the single serve tins for sides and dessert are brilliant.  As well this is not the place you take your dream person on a perfect romantic place.  But if you want damn good BBQ this is you place.  The first time I walked into Smoque on one Sunday night a little after 7pm, the place was packed and the line from counter to the door, I knew I had found my favorite BBQ place in Chicago.  Then I tasted the food and nearly fell of my chair because I had found a place to stop my mouth from watering for BBQ for months.  Go forth and drench your face in BBQ sauce don't be shy, just don't wear a white shirt!!
