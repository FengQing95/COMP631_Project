Little Goat Diner////Had the best time with my girlfriend here today. It's her birthday. Couldn't do dinner because of scheduling problems so I was already kind of in hot water. The service made this a distant afterthought. Really went above and beyond. The food is outstanding. This place might be my fav lunch spot now.
