Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The best staff I've ever experienced, especially the manager! She asked my table if we could move, since there's 1.5 hr table limit and we were there over 2 hours. Most places they just tell you your time is up and that's totally fine! But the manager at ba ba reeba offered to move my 7 top table to sit at one of the bars that wasn't in use since she could tell we were having a great time! It was complete unexpected and unnecessary, but she made it clear she cared about our experience and it made our night. Thanks guys!!
