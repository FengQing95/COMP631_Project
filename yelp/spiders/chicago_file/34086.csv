Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The real fail here was the bone in Delmonico Strip and Filet!!! The pomme frites just blah. There is a funky weird flavoring to this meat that just pretty much ruined it. I've never had this taste nor tasted it on any meat, and guess what? After dessert and another drink, it was still there. Just not good. Like the service. I tipped the runner because I saw my waiter twice. Both times to place drink/dinner orders and it was not because they were busy, or for lack of trying.
