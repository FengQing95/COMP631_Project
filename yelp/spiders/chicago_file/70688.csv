Little Goat Diner////Our waitress arrives and is very welcoming. Sis orders an iced tea. I absently ask for the Syria Coup before catching myself. "I mean the Syrah Qupe." Our phones sit on the table between us. We discuss plans for Thanksgiving, apparently our parents have divorced. A pedal pub wheels past the large storefront windows and I wave at them. Before we can order our waiter arrives with two dishes that I don't remember either of us ordering. Sis offers me her plate of chicken and french toast to taste, but I'm like no thanks--carbs. She jokes maybe you shouldn't have that Syria Coup then, and maybe she's right, I'm waving for our waitress to come back but she pulls my arm down. I'm startled by how swift she grabs it. "I was just kidding," she says. "Do what you want."
