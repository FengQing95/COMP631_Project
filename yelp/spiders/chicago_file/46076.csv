Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////There's already nearly 300 reviews for this place... can I really add anything new?  Probably not.  However, I have to say that the sangria here really is the best ever.  I love the white, the red, the peach, the passion fruit, all of them.  And they're not just tasty-- they're strong too!  Watch out when you try to stand up!
