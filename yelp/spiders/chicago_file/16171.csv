Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm a pizza lover - essentially live on it - and I love Lou Mal's deep dish cheese pizza, butter crust, uncut, well done.  Ask for the spices on the side too (parmesan, red pepper and oregano) to spice it up a bit.  Know it can be filling, but they have an individual size (perfect for me) for those who can't stomach it.
