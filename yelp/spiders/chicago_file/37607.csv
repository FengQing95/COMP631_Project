Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////First time and jesus it is definitely all it's fracked up to be. Got the petite filet, creamed spinach (the. Cheese omg) the frites! And east coast oysters. The oysters were to die for. Spinach second, steak third and the fries are cooked in steak fat- amazing but I'm not the biggest fry eater. The bartender was so sweet and gave me the spinach for free because I was alone for my first time and couldn't decide.
