Smoque BBQ////The sides (Mac & Cheese and cornbread) were still piping hot and small enough to not fill you up (so that you enjoy the awesome MEAT). Oh and this place is STILL BYOB with no extra "corking" fees to exploit it. Yep! My group and I brought in a fifth and a 6 pack of beers, and boy was it great to sit down and drink that to get a nice summer buzz going before eating :-) $25 liquor store tab sure beats a $125 bar tab!
