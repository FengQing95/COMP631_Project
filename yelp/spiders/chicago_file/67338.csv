Little Goat Diner////Yum yum yummy yum yum!  Came here for lunch with 2 friends on a Monday afternoon.  It was busy, but not insane.  We didn't even have to wait for a table.  I ordered the mushroom, apple and cheddar quesadilla while my friends ordered the Fat club and Los something or other sandwich.  My quesadilla was DELISH and came with a healthy yogurt dipping sauce.  The brussel sprout salad it came with was so good too.  My friends sandwiches didn't come with any sides so they ordered a side order of fries, and it was large enough for them to share.  The price of the sandwiches were a little more than the average diner, especially because they didn't come with a side, but they were so tasty that it didn't matter.  And after our meal we went next door to get a homemade pop tart.....worth the calories for sure!  Can't wait to go back and try the breakfast!  Oh, and to take advantage of the rooftop in the summer :)
