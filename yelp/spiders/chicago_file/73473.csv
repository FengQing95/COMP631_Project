Little Goat Diner////My Paratha Burrito had a lot of interesting flavors and textures going on, but it just seemed kinda bland, which was surprising because everything at Girl and the Goat is max-flavorful, sometimes too flavorful. I was able to get more of the chili sauce which helped. The mac and cheese was really disappointing -- mushy noodles and bland cheese sauce. I admit I have sky-high mac and cheese standards because of Hot Chocolate's version in Bucktown, but still, it seemed like Little Goat could do better.
