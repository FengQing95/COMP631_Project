Little Goat Diner////Food was good. Service was good. Hostess station was a nightmare. Even with a reservation we waited probably 20 minutes. Then, a couple in our group brought their baby and it was like there had never been a baby in the building before. The high chairs were too low for our booth so I asked the hostesses to brainstorm other solutions (another table, perhaps or re-arrange seating). They literally didn't reply so I said "What would you recommend? What would you do in my situation? Still no reply. They just shrugged. I couldn't believe it. Â I would go again for the food but I'd never, ever book a group there again.
