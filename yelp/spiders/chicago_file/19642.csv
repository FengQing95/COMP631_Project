Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This location could stand to make several improvements and can't say I would recommend it to my worst enemy. When I arrived I was told it would be a 40 minute wait by the hostess outside. I asked her if the bar was first available and she said that it was. As I started to walk in I decided to put my name on the list just in case searing opened up. We'll within 10 minutes I got a text that my table was ready so not quite sure what the 40 minutes was about. When I reported back to the hostess outside she told me I needed to go inside. The server inside told me I needed to go upstairs. It seems like there should be a better process for this. Upstairs I was seated and couldn't help but notice there were at least 6 or 7 tables available. Jacob came and took my order. He told me it would be almost an hour for the pizza. I ordered a personal pepperoni deep dish with the signature buttercrust. The wait was about 50 minutes as he said. While waiting I wanted to charge my phone. I couldn't help but notice there were electrical sockets in the ceiling but none were at the tables that customers could access while they waited for their hour. Also the restaurant was uncomfortably cold in temperature. When Jacob brought the pizza out it was not what I had ordered. It was a cheese and not a pepperoni. I had to get up from the table to find Jacob to tell him. He did offer to make the correct one but I was done at this point and just wanted to leave. I would recommend skipping this location and trying one of the other Lous. I hear the one on State street is good but this one is for the birds!
