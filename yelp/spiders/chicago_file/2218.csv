The Purple Pig////This place is great for family style. Some dishes are small. But some are big portions. My favorites are pork shoulder and Half Duck Confit. Both are big portions. Luckily I was here with big families so I got to try both. When I come back again with small family, it is going to be hard to choose. Both meats are so tender as if they can melt in your mouth. If I really have to choose, I would pick Duck Confit.
