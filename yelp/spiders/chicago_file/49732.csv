Smoque BBQ////This place is in my hood and it is quite the find. Off the recommendation of my sister I gave it a shot. Ever seen the episode of Seinfeld with the Soup Nazi? Well this place is nothing like that but you will feel the pressure of the line of people behind you antsy to order, so when it is your turn to order make sure your ready. Great eating experience though I am not a fan of cafeteria style dining so for that I cannot give it a Â star.
