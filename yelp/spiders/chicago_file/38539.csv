Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Delicious! I've never spent 290$ for a meal but I did here! Benjamin our server was incredible and very knowledgeable! Had garlic shrimp, trout ceaser salad, brussel sprouts, streak frites and filet. All amazing and flavorful. Ordered 2 bottles of wine and had a lovely atmosphere enjoying. Ordered chocolate pie to go. Before meal got Old Fashion and run and ginger beer cocktail - fantastic. Relaxing, enjoyable atmosphere and great for a special day!
