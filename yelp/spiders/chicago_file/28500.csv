Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Malnati Salad: 5,000/5. AMAZING. BEST SALAD EVER. This salad is huge and definitely for sharing, but I did some damage because it was so dang good. There must be some banned substance in the dressing or something because I couldn't stop eating. I feel bad for my future salads. They'll never come close.
