Art Institute of Chicago////I love the Chicago Art Institute. Also, in nearly every wing, there will be a painting that you know. My favorite is Nighthawks by Edward Hopper, and it was there this time! Yay! It's on the top floor if you're looking for it. Also, the museum is so big, it's a great way to spend the afternoon.
