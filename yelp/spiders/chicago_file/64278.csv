Smoque BBQ////Sliced brisket was good, pulled pork just as good. You get two bbq sauces to pick from. One is thicker than the other. Skip the mac and cheese, unless you like the home made cheese sauce to be a little grainy. But even then still didn't make me wish to have more. Fries are fresh cut and crispy and were good. Corn bread was pretty good. Seating is limited. Service was good. You order your food first and then get seated.
