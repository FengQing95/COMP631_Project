Little Goat Diner////Best advice - if you don't want to wait, get there before 8:45 AM Â or around 4-5 PM on a Saturday or Sunday. On one of my trips, the wait was quoted as 2.5 hours for lunch (around 12 PM), but it ended up only being 1.5 hours. It was okay, we went to Glazed and Infused for an appetizer. :)
