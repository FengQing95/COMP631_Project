Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Plus, we were seated at the very end of the restaurant, in what felt like a private room where a party of 15 people or so took up almost the entire room, and we were sitting in the same room with them, next to a hallway that was separated by a curtain. So sadly the table and the room didn't make for the perfect experience.
