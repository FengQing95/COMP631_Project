Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////2) Lion's Fire: This was a shaken combination of Evan Williams Bourbon, angistora bitters and allspice that came out very... pink and sweet. This surprised me as I wasn't expecting a shaken and sweet drink based on the description on the menu. It was a good drink, just not my favorite.
