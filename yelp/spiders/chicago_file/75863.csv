Little Goat Diner////TL,DR - weekends looking at 45 min - 1hr wait. recommend their drinks and coffee. "This little piggy went to china" plate is a bit salty just a heads up. Interior is nice and clean and dimly lit. I enjoyed the place, if it return it will be for the drinks and only when wait time is reasonable.
