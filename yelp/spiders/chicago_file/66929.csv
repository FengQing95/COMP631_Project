Little Goat Diner////This was by far my favorite place while visiting Chicago! Every dish we ordered was incredible and fresh. We went twice just to experience more of the menu. The staff is super friendly, helpful and efficient. The French toast, fat Elvis waffle, cheese grits, hash browns, pancakes, all Fantastic! And the best cup of coffee ever!
