Art Institute of Chicago////This museum is expansive and its collections impressive. I really enjoyed the Impressionism, European Art before 1900 and American Modern Art galleries. The grand staircase is beautiful and the 2nd level has so many rooms it seems to go on forever. This is definitely a museum you need to visit on multiple occasions if you want to take in all of the galleries. Â
