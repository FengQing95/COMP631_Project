Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's did not disappoint!! Everyone we spoke to recommended this place to us!! The butter Â crust was sooo good!! Ordering the pizza when you check in helps on the wait time. Even on a Saturday night we didn't wait all that long. We will definitely visit again when we come back to Chicago.
