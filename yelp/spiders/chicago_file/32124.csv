Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////To say I went into this visit with some skepticism, barely conveys the truth. I like deep dish but how can this place be so amazing especially since they seem pretty corporate in their marketing and multitudes of locations. Well, I'll stop right there and tell you this: IT. WAS. AMAZING.
