Art Institute of Chicago////I'm in Chicago on a budget so when I heard the price to enter the Institute I wasn't too excited. But I paid and went inside anyways...it was totally worth it!! I'm not even an art fan but to see so many classic works of art that I've only seen in textbooks made the admission totally worth it. I could easily spend 2 hours in there browsing the galleries.
