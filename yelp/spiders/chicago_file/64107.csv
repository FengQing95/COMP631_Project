Smoque BBQ////I tried this place several years ago.  I was in the mood for bbq.  Figured i would give it a shot.  Nice Hispanic guy in the front greets you and advises how it works. He gets a  star and should get a raise.  The ratings and hype I don't understand.  I think it's overpriced and the taste is ok. Nothing phenomenal.  I wish bbq supply was still open, that place rocked.
