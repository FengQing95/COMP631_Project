Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For an appetizer, we chose the Spinach Stuffed Bread. It was enough for three people, but anymore and we would have ordered an additional appetizer. Marinara sauce came with, which added some bold tomato and herbie flavor. The bread was thick and the cheese stuffed inside was thicker. All three of us agreed that this appetizer was definitely. very. appetizing.
