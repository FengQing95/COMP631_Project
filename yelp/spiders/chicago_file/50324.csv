Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is that they recently started doing delivery.  Having dined at the restaurant for many years, I know the food and the portion sizes, and though the prices were the same, both times I ordered for delivery the portions were greatly reduced.  I've seen other restaurants do this and I think it's fucking rude - just because they don't have to look you in the eye when they drop off the food, they think it's okay to cheat the customer?  I ordered the tomato goat cheese and it literally came with two tiny pieces of garlic bread, for $10 bucks - when you order this at the restaurant, it's like a cauldron of tomato and cheese with a whole basket of bread.  Anyway, I spent about $100 bucks on a delivery order for several people and we were all hungry when the food was gone, which is just a shame.  So, for that reason, I remove one star to punish you, Cafe Ba Ba Reeba!  Don't cheat your delivery customers!
