Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The happy hour is a good deal, $16 sangria pitchers and a bunch of small plates for cheap. We just stopped in for a quick drink but for a Friday afternoon the bar area had open seating available immediately. While brief, I enjoyed my experience there and hope to be back and try much much more!
