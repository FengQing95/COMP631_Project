Smoque BBQ////I love BBQ, and having lived in Florida, I was spoiled on some really amazing places, even a few which were just screened-in shacks. Smoque elevates BBQ to a different level; not better per se, but more of an element of style. I do wish they'd vary the menu up a bit, to include the mac-daddy of all bbq meats, burnt-ends, but alas, I'll settle on the pulled pork. Adding a "taste" to your plate is always a bonus. There's some competition with Big Bricks, County BBQ (which is close to work), and my own fine slow-cooked ribs, but Smoque's still on top.
