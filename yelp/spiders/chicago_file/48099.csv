Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Next time I go I definitely would like to try their paella to see if it's worth the 45 minute wait and the 2 person minimum serving. WTF? I can handle the wait because it's paella but really? 2 person minimum? If you want great paella, great service, and slightly less hype-I'd choose Avec..
