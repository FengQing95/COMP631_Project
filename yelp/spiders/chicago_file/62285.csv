Smoque BBQ////Staff is very friendly and the atmosphere, if you are eating in, is nice.  It will be loud, due to the number of people that are there at all times, but nothing that can't keep you from having a conversation with friends.  Bottom line, it is a good BBQ, but I have had better.  Much better in fact in the suburbs (Steamboat in Wheaton for anyone in that area).  If I was in the area and wanting BBQ though, I would not hesitate to get some Smoque.  I would just make sure I placed a to go order.
