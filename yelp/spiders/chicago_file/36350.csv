Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The experience for me turned downhill when we paid our bill. The waiter brought us the bill and I left my credit card on the table for him to pick up. But when he came back with the swiped card and receipt for signature, he put it in front of my friend who is white although it was me, an Asian, who put in the credit card. In diversity training, we call this kind of action a manifestation of "micro-aggression," i.e. actions which subtly and sub-consciously diminished the value of minorities. I was extremely disappointed. I would encourage the manager to better train its staff on how to serve its customers.
