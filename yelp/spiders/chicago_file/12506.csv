Art Institute of Chicago////Word of the wise: if you're planning to spend a whole day there, pace yourself. It's a big place. Don't spend too much time reading every individual placard in a room of statues you're not interested in, because you'll get fatigued. Prioritize the art pieces that you really want to see. Eat beforehand, if you're like me and don't want to pay for an overpriced museum snack.
