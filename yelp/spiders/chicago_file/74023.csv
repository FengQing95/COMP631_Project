Little Goat Diner////The food was great. We got the tenders for an app and fries (the fries are a must). He ordered the pot pie and could've licked the plate clean. I got the fried chicken with a biscuit; it was good but not filling in the best way possible- stuck to your bones but didn't make me feel stuffed.
