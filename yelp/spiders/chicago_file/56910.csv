Smoque BBQ////Pulled pork sandwich - pork was a little dry and I had to pull off several chunks of fat.  I like the pork completely smothered in BBQ sauce, and the amount of sauce given still left me with non-sauced pork at the end.  The top of the bun was rather dry, which also made me want more sauce.
