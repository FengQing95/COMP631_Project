Little Goat Diner////I was wondering what the rave about this place was. But the flavors are so unique with a hint of comfort in them that I want to experiment what all their flavors are like. This little piggy went to China was my favorite. They nail the idea of salt, fat, acid, heat to make a scrumptious combo that's not disrespectful to the Asian palate. The Okonomiyaki was excellent too. A proper homage to the Japanese dish, I think it nails the savory flavors with an egg-based brunch like flair. Â The service was absolutely excellent and I can't wait to be back when I'm next in town.
