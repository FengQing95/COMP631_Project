Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place has a great happy hour deal with $1-2 tapas as well as pitchers of sangria. I would say that you get what you pay for here, and it's not a bad meal. But if you're looking for more quality than just a deal, this may not be for you. I enjoyed the Catalan tomato bread, patatas bravas, and Spanish omelet. The free bread was also delicious and freshly cut! The sangria wasn't very strong but had a decent flavor.
