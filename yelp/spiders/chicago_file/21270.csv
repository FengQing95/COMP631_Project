Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came here for lunch because it was recommended by folks back home. I liked the decor and the prices. The lunch special was 8.95 and includes a soup or salad, a personal pie and a drink. The food was good but not the best pie I had while in town. And it still took 45 min. So it was nice to have a fresh pizza.
