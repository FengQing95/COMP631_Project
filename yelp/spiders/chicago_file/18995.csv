Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////"Considered the oldest family name in Chicago pizza, Lou Malnati's is as rich in history as its pizza is in flavor." After years perfecting his craft in other pizza shops, Lou was finally ready to venture out on his own. On March 17, 1971, Lou and his wife Jean opened their first Lou Malnati's in Lincolnwood, Chicago and today, Lou Malnati's has 36 locations and counting.
