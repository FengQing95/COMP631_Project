Little Goat Diner////The food overall was pretty good, I had the tonkotsu sammie and the smoked fries. The fries were fantastic albeit a bit too salty. On the other hand the sandwich was very flavorful, but the plain white bread - while tasty, was a bit of a let down especially since the ingredients in the sandwich started getting the bread soggy as I was halfway through and I eat fast. So, I guess it wouldn't be a good idea to have any leftovers.
