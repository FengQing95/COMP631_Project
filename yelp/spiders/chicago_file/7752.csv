Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute of Chicago is brilliant, and I would suggest devoting at least 4 hours to viewing the artwork inside. Indeed, one could really spend weeks here and still not see everything. Even better, you are allowed to take pictures using non-flash photography (my dumb ass took 2 photos using flash). We actually had to make a mad dash to see Grant Wood's American Gothic and Edward Hopper's Nighthawks (these were the two paintings that I really wanted to see). The Art Institute also hosts a multitude of works by artists such as Monet, El Greco, Manet, Mary Cassatt, etc. (I probably saw 5% of all the works displayed within the Institute in a period fo 3 hours...). They also have works from Korea, India, Medieval Europe, etc. If you are visiting Chicago and you have not already done so, go to the Art Institute.
