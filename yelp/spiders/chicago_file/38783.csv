Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Since the foie gras and beef tongues were so heavy, I got something "lighter". I almost never get salads, but I got the Crab Stuffed Avocado. This was my first time having bibb lettuce and the sherry-dijon vinegrette was delicious! Didn't take a picture of his dish, but it was short rib stroganoff.
