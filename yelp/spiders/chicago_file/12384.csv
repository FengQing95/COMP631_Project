Art Institute of Chicago////No,I don't see myself getting on a plane to go to Chicago just to go the Art Institute, despite the many treasures contained within its walls (including Seurat's "Un dimanche apres-midi sur l'isle de la Grande Jatte" or, in English, "Sunday in the Park" made famous by the Sondheim musical).
