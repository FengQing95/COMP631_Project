Little Goat Diner////Felt like having a hearty breakfast today to fill the engine with good gas for running errands in this tropical weather we're experiencing in Chicago today. (10 degrees - insert palm tree).  Corned beef hash and eggs, poached.  (Sometimes I like to make the dish messy like a five year old and break the yolk to watch the ooze).  The hash browns in the mix were crispy and tasty, bits of smoked corned beef for flavor and one of the eggs was perfectly poached, the other was the Danny Devito of the pair. (Referencing the movie Twins). A very good portion though, just needed a wee bit more salt.
