Little Goat Diner////I ordered the fish tostadas.  They were AMAZING, probably my favorite fish taco/tostada dish of all time.  The tostada was perfect, not too crispy and not the slightest bit soggy.  The battered white fish did not have a strong fishy flavor and fried to perfection.  I thoroughly enjoyed the slaw and the sauce was the cherry on top - note: it is not spicy but had a little kick (then again, i have a very low tolerance for spicy foods).  A wonderful dish that filled me up without that uncomfortable feeling.  My friend ordered the patty melt with the beef, and she enjoyed it as well.  We shared the smoked fries, which was very delicious.  However, I wished the sandwiches came with fries on the side, BUT it was worth it.
