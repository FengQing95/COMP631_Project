Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My husband and I love bringing our friends to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba for brunch! From their pitcher of sangria to their bacon covered dates, this place has something for everyone! Make sure to either come early (before 11AM) or make a reservation or else you might have to wait. Btw, this place is humongous! I've never really had to wait, but I would hate to be hangry while watching other people eat the amazing food here! Lol.
