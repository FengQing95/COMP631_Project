Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Yum! Everything was flawless from the time we walked in until the time we left. Service was quick and efficient (I believe the name of our server was Julio). He was professional and friendly. For food we started with the baked goat cheese. It was robust and absolutely delicious coming with buttery toast on the side. For our main courses I ordered the 10 oz filet and added mushrooms for an additional $7. I asked about what type of mushrooms they were and Julio was very knowledgable about the type and location from where they were from. The filet also came with a b√©arnaise sauce that was delicious as well. My boyfriend got the 22oz bone in ribeye, his was good but we both agreed the filet was better. For a side we tried the creamed spinach with blue cheese and caramelized onions which I will definitely be returning for more of!! I was impressed with everything down to the wine list. Will be back soon!!
