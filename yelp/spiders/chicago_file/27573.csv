Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My wife and I were staying in Chicago for a night and wanted to enjoy some Chicago-style pizza, so we picked this place out. It seemed like it would be good and I have known the name because some of my family grew up in the city. When I called, the employee that took my order was quite rude. I understand that we are in Chicago and prices are generally higher, but we ended up paying Â around $30 for a medium deep dish pizza (before delivery fees and tip.) The pizza was not very good and the sauce was very plain with not a lot of flavor. I will not be ordering from Lou Malnati's again if I can help it. Overall, I don't feel like a got a pizza that was worth what I paid for.
