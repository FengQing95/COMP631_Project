Little Goat Diner////*Maybe* 8 seconds later, I see the spot again, only it's swinging... because it's a motherf*cking spider! Trying to eat my face. And it's so close to my melon that I don't even have time to freak out. I just start clapping both my hands into the air in hopes of nabbing it and smooshing it to death. And because I believe I was brought into this world to be a natural born (spider) killer, I succeeded. Dead as a f*cking doornail.
