Art Institute of Chicago////I wish I had been in Chicago longer, but it was a short trip. Get the Citipass if you're a tourist and want to hit all the hot spots. You can get one at the museum. If you don't want to hit all the spots, know admission is usually $25 per person. Also, if you have a coat, leaving it in the coat rack is $1.
