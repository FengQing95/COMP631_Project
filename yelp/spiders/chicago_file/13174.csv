Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou's get's it done.  Nothing I can really say that hasn't already been said in the other reviews but I always come back to Lou Malnati's as my favorite deep dish of the Chicago greats.  I don't personally like the sausage frisbee but everything else is awesome, can't go wrong...
