Little Goat Diner////Coming to the eating part - they have some really good apps and I really liked their Crab Dip, the crackers were really fresh and the dip was also delicious! We also ordered the goat chili and I can say that it was the best goat chili I ever had. I ordered the goat almighty and it was just out of this world. The meat was nice cooked and juicy, I could taste the flavors and not to forget the burger was really huge!!
