Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is the kind of place you take your mom to when you're trying to prove to her you're not a complete fuck up.  The sangria will lull her into a sense of comfort while the moon roof hypnotizes her into believing you really are the best son/daughter in the world.  These comforts get her prepared for the endless trays of tapas which wash over her like the bountiful sense of pride she could never really could express in you.
