Smoque BBQ////Unfortunately, Smoque just doesn't travel well.  I've picked up lunch for my folks (who only live about 40 minutes away), yet it's never tasted as good as it does at the restaurant.  Don't get me wrong: the food is still good, but just not as good as it is at the restaurant.  Go figure.
