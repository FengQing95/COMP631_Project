Little Goat Diner////The two stars is for the service. Our food was a greasy mess. The omelette had a brown crispness like it was fried in an inch of grease. Daughter had CB hash & eggs. The hash had dry salty corned beef on the bottom, next layer shredded potatoes that were all crisp, no regular potato just shredded of brown crisp. Egg was greasy as well. Even the cookie from the bakery, oatmeal cherry, was flavorless except for the cherries. All that for $40. Never again.
