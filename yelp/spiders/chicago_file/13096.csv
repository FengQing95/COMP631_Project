Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered it for delivery and got an estimated delivery time of about 45 to 60 minutes.  I was surprised to see the delivery guy about 35 minutes later with my small ("for 2 people") Chicago classic, and small salad.  The total including the 3.75 delivery charge was $22.80.
