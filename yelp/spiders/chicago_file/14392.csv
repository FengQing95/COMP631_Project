Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I don't like deep dish pizza. All the cheese makes me gag, it's heavy and awful and not my thing. But I was in Chicago with some teenagers and felt like I'd be depriving them of a quintessential Chicago experience if I didn't take them for deep dish. So, we waited. And waited and waited. And nearly starved. At the advice of the hostess, we placed our order (The Malnati Chicago Classic--sausage, cheese, and tomato sauce on Buttercrust) while we were waiting, so once we were seated our pizza came pretty quickly. Maybe it was that I was so hungry. Maybe it was that I hadn't been to Chicago in years and my palate has matured (or something). Whatever it was, I loved it. It was savory and satisfying, with the perfect ratio of crust to tomato to cheese to sausage. I'm officially converted.
