Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The Wine: We ordered a bottle of Malbec that came way too cold from the cellar. After complaining, the sweet manager offered us a glass of a French wine while waiting for the bottle to reach room temperature. This was nice, but they really have to do something about these cold bottles. Both wines, nevertheless, were delicious.
