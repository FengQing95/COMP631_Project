Little Goat Diner////We stopped at the restaurant for some dinner Â (8pm). Since they serve breakfast all day we decided to order breakfast for dinner. My husband order the double chocolate chip pancakes. I ordered the Bull's Eye French toast. We decided to share a plate of hash browns (no cheese), and the smoke french fries.
