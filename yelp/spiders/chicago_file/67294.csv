Little Goat Diner////Oh Little Goat how I wanted to like you so. Your cinnabun was slightly overbaked -- 2 min too long. Sad dry cinnabun. The chocolate pancakes were nice and fluffy though. The Asian egg bacon tasty thing was not as tasty as I hoped. Non-Asians trying to make Asian food rarely works out. Can I get some hash browns without goat cheese, please? $3.50 for a cup of coffee? It better be damn good. Yours was sour. Thankfully we were able to walk right in. Had we had to wait an hour for this, it'd be a one star experience.
