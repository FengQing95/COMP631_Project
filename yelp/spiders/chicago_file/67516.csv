Little Goat Diner////I was so very amazed by their sandwich called "Los Drowned".  Its something like a $13 sandwich, but it is worth every damn penny.  Wow.  I keep telling my husband about it but we have not gotten a chance to get there.  Of course the portion is ridiculous too, so you can probably split it with another.  I -who wasn't even hungry when my friend and I went- managed to eat the entire thing, NOT because I was hungry but because I could not stop eating it it was so delicious.
