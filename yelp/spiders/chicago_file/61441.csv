Smoque BBQ////Back in 2007...Watched the Triple D show with Guy Fieri (diners, drive ins and dives) on the Food Network channel and went to the restaurant that following week. Blown away by the flavor of the sauces, the quality of food, the amount you get, the friendliness of the staff and most of all...THE BEEF BRISKET! It melts in your mouth and is the best I've had! I grew up in the South and by far, this is the best bbq joint I've eaten at! HIGHLY Recommended!!!!
