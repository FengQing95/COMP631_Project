Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Leigh ordered the olives.  I don't eat olives myself, but was quite impressed with the quantity and variety of olives that came out.  There was literally a troth of olives.  I ordered the roast dates with bacon and apple vinaigrette.  Holy Moly that was so good.  It was probably the best thing I've ever eaten anything tastier.  It was delicious!
