Art Institute of Chicago//// I've been to the superstar museums - Los Angeles' Getty, Paris' Louvre, New York's Met, Washington D.C.'s National Gallery, London's National Gallery, Florence's Uffizi. Yet, you never hear Chicago's Art Institute mentioned in the same breath. There's good reason - it's collection, while amazing, doesn't have the same breadth or depth as these superstar museums.
