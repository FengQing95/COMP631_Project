Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Not sure what makes this place a "European" steakhouse, but I do know it's delicious. Bread was served warm, service was friendly and helpful, wine list is thoughtfully organized. Atmosphere has a club feel, although it takes your eyes a few minutes to adjust because it's dark. The bar is a great place to grab a drink if you have to wait for a table; although the surface of it is uneven in areas, so be careful where you set your drink! My petit filet was cooked to a perfect medium rare, the spicy corn side dish was soupier than I was expecting and I Â am not sure the corn was fresh, but it tasted good. Pommes frites were also delicious, crispy and the right hit of salt. Side of aioli not necessary. Will definitely return here!
