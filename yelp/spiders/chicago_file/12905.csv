Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Really really good deep dish pizza. I almost never eat meat but Lou's pepperoni is week worth the exception. The sausage pizza can be a little greasy and is never finely chopped enough as it is in big sheets on the pizza as attested to by others many times. Had there pizza at least 100 times but never more than three times in a weekend! The best. Could use a few more beers on draft.
