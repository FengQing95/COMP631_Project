Little Goat Diner////First time visiting the Little Goat Diner and I was so happy that I did. Although I'm not GF, DF or Vegan I was so impressed that they have specific menus for each. I had the smoked corned beef hash with eggs and a sourdough pancake as my side. The portions are very large and especially delicious. My friend had the Fat Elvis Waffles (waffles with bananas, peanut butter, bacon and maple syrup) and she loved them. Our waitress was fantastic, so friendly and helpful. I highly recommend the Little Goat Diner for anyone spending time or living in Chicago.
