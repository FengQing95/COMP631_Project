Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's in Chicago delivers. Great French Brasserie with of course, great steak frites but also a simple but fantastic menu. Great Bar, handcrafted drinks and the place has a vibe. Â It is however, very, very expensive. So, if you come prepare for a great meal, but bring your wallet.
