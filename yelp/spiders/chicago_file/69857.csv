Little Goat Diner////This was my second visit here and I was not disappointed. The restaurant was crowded and bustling on a rainy and cold Saturday, but the warm atmosphere made up for the dreary weather outdoors. We started with strong coffee and a tasty well spiced chai. Our server was kind and went over the copious menu patiently. I had the bulls eye French toast (which comes with a delicious soft boiled egg in the middle of crispy brioche bread with fried chicken and strawberries) and my boyfriend had the Korean burger (which comes topped with kimchi and bacon) and a side of hash browns, which were were too full to finished. All was divine. Come hungry and leave stuffed. Because the meals are so rich, really take your time with the food and enjoy a nice, long leisurely meal.
