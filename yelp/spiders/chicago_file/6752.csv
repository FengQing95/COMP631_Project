Art Institute of Chicago////Pretty much the best place ever.  A world class museum with some of the best permanent collections in America.  Definitely biased towards 19th and 20th century artwork, but if that's your thing (and it probably should be), you'd do a lot worse than spending a lot of time here.  I'm not going to tell you about all of the little hidden things that make it truly special because a) it's better if you find them on your own, and b) they're mine and I don't like to share.  The museum is wonderful and I'm consistently torn between trying to tell people how awesome it is and being nonchalant because I want it all to myself.  I'd recommend weekday mornings if possible because you'll really just be sharing it with SAIC students, and they hardy ever bite if there aren't cameras around filming them for a performance piece.  Seriously go and check out the twentieth century American galleries, and don't miss the Cornell boxes.
