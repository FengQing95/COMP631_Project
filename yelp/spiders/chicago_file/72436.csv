Little Goat Diner////Cute diner. Wish they'd serve breakfast on their rooftop over the summer. The bakery is not easy to manage. Service is quick and efficient. Turn over time is usually overestimated by Staff, rightfully so. One of my favorite brunch places. I'd go every week if it wasn't for the ridiculous wait time even at 9 am on a Sunday.
