Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////While on a cross country road trip and culinary tour of America, one of our friends who is from Chicago told us to go here to taste the deep dish pizza Chicago is famous for. This place had a 30-45 minute wait and the pizzas take 35 minutes to cook so they took pre-orders. The service was transactional at best, but the pizza was good! (My boyfriend is from New York and I am a big fan of thin crust, so we're a tough couple to please) but the pizza was really good. We got the Malnatti's special which has cheeze and sausage. Yum!
