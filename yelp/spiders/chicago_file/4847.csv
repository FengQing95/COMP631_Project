The Purple Pig////It was quite a busy afternoon when I went in; it was Mother's Day, so I decided to sit at the bar. I started out with a sangria and it was delicious. I knew my meal was going to be on the pricey side, so I had a charcuterie plate with blue cheese and duck proscuitto, as well as a small plate of some type of fried mozzarella. I don't remember what it was called, but it was really good! The one thing I wish is that it was described as a sandwich, not fried cheese. Since I was already getting a cheese plate, it was a heavy meal.
