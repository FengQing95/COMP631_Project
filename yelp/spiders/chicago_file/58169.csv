Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I was visiting Chicago for the 4th of July weekend. My best friend recommended this spot and I'm so glad that she did! I made a reservation for Friday at 12pm, and we were quickly seated outside in the air conditioned enclosed-patio. It's such a low-key/unpretentious/cute date spot!
