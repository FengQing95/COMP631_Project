The Purple Pig////I had a great time at The Purple Pig. They recently opened the outdoor so I decided to give it a try. I was lucky to get a reservation spot on Tock. The reservation does require a $20 fee which will be applied to the check, but sometimes they might forget, so you want to check the final bill. The outdoor area was very small- maybe 5-6 tables, but it was fenced off and had its own trailer bathroom.
