Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Let me start by saying that I am huge pizza fan! I pretty much love all pizza (yes, even the cheap Jack's pizzas from the grocery store). We have had Lou Malnati's catered to my office several times and I loved their thin crust pizza!! Sadly, whenever my boyfriend and I try to order deep dish at home, it falls short of delicious/edible. On Valentines day, we ordered the heart pizza and it came soggy and very undercooked. We informed the store of this and received a gift card in return, which was a very nice gesture by the manager of the Gold Coast location. Last night, we decided to give it another try and we ordered a large deep dish with lots of delicious sounding toppings: pepperoni, garlic, mushroom, olives, extra cheese, and buttercrust, cooked well done and uncut (per the previous managers suggestions)!! WE WERE SO EXCITED. However, our excitement quickly faded when we started eating the pizza only to find it covered with a thin slice of sausage covering the entire slice/pizza! I have a strong distaste for sausage and decided..ok..I'll just take it off and enjoy the rest of the cheesy goodness. FAIL. When you take the sausage off, it takes off the entire top of the pizza including the sauce and olives, etc. I was so disappointed. As much as I wanted to love it, I think I'll stick with Peaquod's for my deep dish cravings from now on. :(
