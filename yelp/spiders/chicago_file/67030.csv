Little Goat Diner////The only complaint I had is that we happened to go on one of the recent crazy July heatwave days and the A/C was completely ineffective.  You could tell it was running flat out - the building was shaking from it, but there was no air flow or cool temps to be had anywhere in the dining room.  I've never sweat so much eating a meal.
