Little Goat Diner////Value: Expect to spend around $16 per dish here. We got 3 things but post-tax pre-tip check was $47 and change. I thought it was very reasonable for a place like this. We had to push ourselves to finish 3 dishes so a dish each plus a side would probably be a more typical portion and price point which is right around $25/person range.
