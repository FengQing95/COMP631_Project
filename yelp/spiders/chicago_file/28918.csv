Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So Chicago is known for deep dish pizza. And Chicago has many pizzerias that serve their own twist of deep dish pizza. So... how do you choose the best deep dish pizza spot knowing that there's many others. If you're like me, you probably think "whats the best spot" , "where's the best bang for the buck?" , "I don't want to waste my time" , "I don't want to be disappointed" .... well I'll make it easy for you...
