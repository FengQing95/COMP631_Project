Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////One of the best places I've had breakfast. Unfortunately, there was no Denny's around- so Â we had to settle for this place. Thankfully it was a 11 minute walk from my hotel. I couldn't get enough so I came here 2x's in a row. Depending on what you get- it can get a little pricey- but the portions are enough to fill you up to the rim. If I can recall, my oatmeal and french toast, including tip was $16 USD.
