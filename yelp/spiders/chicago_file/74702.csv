Little Goat Diner////I had a Michelada to start, which tasted like a good simple Bloody Mary without the toothpicks of food in it. The server Minty was personable and knew the very large menu cold. She was able to help my niece decide on a brunchy dish leaning vegetarian, and chose the Goat'O Goat'O shrimp and veggie with peanut dressing salad. My wife chose the same. I chose the Sloppy Goat, a Joe with BBQ goat meat and a huge pile of slaw on a ethereal bun to die for.
