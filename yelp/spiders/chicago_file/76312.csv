Little Goat Diner////I was VERY impressed with Little Goat. My friends told me we were going to a diner and I was not very excited to hear it, but as soon as I saw the plates people were eating and read the menu, I knew we made the right choice. The balance of flavor was absolute perfection. Umami, sour and sweet, savory and starchy, everything. I have never tasted anything like it (southern and Chinese fusion). I highly recommend it and am dying to go back!
