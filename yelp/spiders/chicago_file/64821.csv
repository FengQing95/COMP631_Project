Smoque BBQ////My bbq plate was nomtastic! I had the brisket platter, service is decent, price was a little high Â $25 for the platter and drink and two extra sides. I wish the Marconi was a bigger portion. Parking is packed so try the back of it, we didn't know until we asked. Seating area could be better, you are elbow to elbow with the next table.
