Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was visiting from out of town and then had to wait a whole additional 30 minutes. This really took a chunk out of my night that was set out for exploring the city. I was not at all pleased about this. We ate quickly once we finally got the pizza we ordered to begin with. Our original server was very nice and extremely apologetic throughout, while her manager remained apathetic about the whole situation.
