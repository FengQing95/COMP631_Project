Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou's is one of the better deep dish pizza joints in Chicago. Be sure to go in earlier Incase there is a wait. What I have liked before is that you can put your pizza order in with the host when you arrive (even if your table isn't ready). That way, your pizza can begin cooking once you arrive and be ready sooner so you do not need to wait much longer after you are seated.
