Little Goat Diner////You can also say I feel love at this Diner because of my boyfriend, he introduced me. About a year ago me and my boyfriend were out, it was late and we were starving. My sweetheart said "I know, let's check out Little Goat" and since then, We were both fans. Jason loves the Tuna melt, it's apparently the best tuna melt he's ever had. For me? Hand's down... The Chickpea Salad, the reason I eat and love kale. I mean it, When I think of what I want for dinner, it's this salad. I ask for it to be customized to my taste, respectfully and professionally they always help me out.
