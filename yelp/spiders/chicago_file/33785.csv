Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Hands down one of the best restaurants in the city. While it's not really a child-friendly restaurant, they are always accommodating when I bring my 1-year old. We get there right at 5 when they open, as that's the trick to getting in without having to make a reservation 3 months in advance. Must haves: Greyhound cocktail, wedge salad, crab-stuffed avocado, filet, corn, broccoli, mashed potatoes, and lemon meringue pie. The greyhound is made with fresh grapefruit juice, the wedge salad is doused with an amazing ranch/blue cheese dressing, the crab-stuffed avocado is perfect for a light appetite, the steak is offered with a separate pot of seasoned salt, the corn is unique and delicious, the broccoli is perfectly seasoned and roasted, and the lemon meringue pie is massive and mouth-watering.
