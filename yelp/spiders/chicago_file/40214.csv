Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////22 oz dry aged ribeye: There is a nice char on the steak. It was nice and tender. The Bernadine sauce complimented the steak pretty well. I could do without the steak sauce. We got the bone barrow with the steak. It was such a good bite with the bone marrow. So buttery and rich.
