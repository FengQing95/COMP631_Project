Smoque BBQ////The decor at Smoque is clean and for once I use clean as negative descriptor.  When it comes to BBQ I feel like the space should be dark, dirty, and loud.  I want to see a country western band playing behind chicken wire getting pelted with Old Style bottles.  I want some old dude telling customers to go to hell when they try tell him how good the BBQ they make at home is.  I want to see a sign that says "Vegetarians Suck" (I don't think vegetarians suck, but I want my pit master to think that).  Unfortunately, the service at Smoque is as good as the restaurant is clean.  The staff wears branded Smoque t-shirts and they all just look too damn nice and clean!
