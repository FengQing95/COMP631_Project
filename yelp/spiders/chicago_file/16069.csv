Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Quick trip to Chicago with the Lovely wife. The weather did not treat us right, it was a wet and cold weekend, but we were very lucky to be seated immediately as we arrived. Ordered the Malnati's Chicago Classic, fried calamari, and spicy wings...Great pizza, love that buttery crust, well balanced combination of quality ingredients, the calamari was fried to perfection, not chewy at all, the wings were surprisingly good for a pizza place, our waiter was attentive and even paired my pizza with a nice cold beer..a young gentlemen (sorry,but forgot your name). The whole experience was great except that the music was a little on the loud side. One recommendation: if you are a party of 2, and Â you are going to order more than one dish, ask not to be seated in a small table, we had to be moved to a larger table, the small table couldn't accommodate 3 dishes + our drinks
