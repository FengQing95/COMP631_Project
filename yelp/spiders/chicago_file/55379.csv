Smoque BBQ////Smoque has some of the best BBQ I've had in the city.  As other yelpers have said, you will want to get there early.  On a weeknight you should be able to order and enjoy your dinner if you get there around 615, but come 7pm it's a packed house and seats can be hard to come by.  I had the chicken and pulled pork and the sauce really made the meal.  The side dishes were good but nothing to write home about.
