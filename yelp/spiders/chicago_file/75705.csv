Little Goat Diner////Hands down the best Bloody Mary to ever touch my lips. Â I've been here in several occasions for brunch. Everything on the menu is great their inlets tend to have a lot of cream cheese in them if you're into that. I prefer more of the savory things fro the "cereal killers" side of the menu. I've gotten 2 if their sandwiches and did not enjoy either of them. Los drowned was good but their breakfast items are better. I also got the tonkatsu and it was no Bueno. The slaw had way too much vinegar in and didn't compliment the sandwich.
