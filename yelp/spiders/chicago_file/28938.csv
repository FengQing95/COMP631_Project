Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've had deep dish pizza before in California but this was amazing. The crust was delicious and the toppings were so fresh and flavorful. BUT, you really can start getting full after a slice... and we made the mistake of ordering a large. We should have opted for a medium pizza that was meant for 3 people. While we were so full from 2 slices, we were determined to finish the pizza... this came at a price though. We probably didn't want to see another pizza for awhile after stuffing ourselves with this pizza.
