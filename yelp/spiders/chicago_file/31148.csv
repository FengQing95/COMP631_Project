Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Being a tourist in Chicago for the 3rd or 4th time it was important for me to really figure out the best Chicago pie this time around.  The two names I heard most often were Lou's and Giordano's.  Lucky me, both places were in walking distance from my hotel.  I decided to try Lou's first, and boy was I impressed.
