Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I just went to Wildberry Chicago Saturday. I have heard so much good reviews about this place that I had to try it. I was impressed with their food. My friends and I went to wildberry to grab some breakfast. We weren't seated right away but we weren't complaining about it either. When people write reviews they can seem slightly biased but I will be as honest as I can. One of my friends order the vanilla berry latte cold, another friend got it I only tried the hot due to the weather. The latte was to sweet for me because I count my calories and I haven't had lots of sugar. I ordered a Mexicana skillet when I say that was the best skillet I had I mean it. I even ate the hash browns because I really don't eat hash browns. The food came out fast and was still fresh and hot. I give this place 5 stars because I was very impressed. I also would recommend their banana pancakes. I have had pancakes before where they smother the cakes in some sugar that makes it better. But wildberry put the perfect amount of sugar. Last go to wildberry if you like pancakes for breakfast.
