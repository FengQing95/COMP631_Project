Smoque BBQ////Enjoying a guys' night out the four of us ordered a large cross section of the menu and dined family style so we could sample everything. All of us were really impressed; the St. Louis Style ribs were possibly the best ribs I have consumed - such exquisite flavor and perfectly cooked. The pulled pork platter and brisket platter were also delicious and even the sides were extremely well executed (the baked beans the the cornbread being my favorites). Portions were fairly generous and pricing quite reasonable - even more so when you factor in the BYOB aspect.
