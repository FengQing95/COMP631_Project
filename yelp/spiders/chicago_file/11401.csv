Art Institute of Chicago////Initially I was a bit bored and overwhelmed because I didn't know where to start, but things started to get more and more interesting as I began to explore the three-stories tall museum. The Art Institute of Chicago has a little bit of everything - from Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Southeast Asian, Himalayan, African, Greek, Roman, Byzantine, Islamic, American Art (before 1900, contemporary art 1945-1960, and modern art 1900-1950), architecture, decorative arts 1920-1970, European art before 1900, impressionism, sculptures, photography, and other exhibitions.
