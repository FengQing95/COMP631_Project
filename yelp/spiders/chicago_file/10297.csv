Art Institute of Chicago////You can spend hours in here.  The art museum is part of the City Pass.  The front facade is magnificent with the two majestic lions.  The museum itself is so expansive!  I mean my feet really hurt after awhile because it's just so big!  Rooms after room of impressive collections, carefully curated.  It felt infinite.  I was fortunate there was a Van Gogh exhibit surrounding the Bedroom series. Amazing to see his work in person. All of the art is wrapped in the beautiful architecture.   Mesmerizing and a bit surreal to visit.  Cheers to all the art appreciation classes I took in school.
