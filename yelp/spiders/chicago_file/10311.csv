Art Institute of Chicago////Went here recently for the first time and was very impressed with their collection.  A lot of different, fascinating exhibits and provided something for everyone - impressionism to modern art to ancient Asian artifacts.  The building itself was also beautiful.  We also had a great experience with Barbara Webster, a security guard who made a special point to show us unique ways to look at the art.  She is obviously very passionate about her job!
