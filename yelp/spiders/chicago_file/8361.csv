Art Institute of Chicago////I have been wanting to visit this museum for years. So when I got the chance to visit Chicago, I jumped on it. I planned my entire last day in Chicago around having plenty of time at the Art Institute. Waiting until the last day was probably a bad idea, because I was exhausted, and my boyfriend, who already isn't a huge art fan, was Mr. Crabby Pants the whole day.
