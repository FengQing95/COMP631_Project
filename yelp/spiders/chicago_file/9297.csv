Art Institute of Chicago////Prepare to spend at least 4 hours in there. It's definitely one of the best art museums in the nation. The Gauguin show cost additional 7 dollars but a must see, worth every penny!!! Great collection of impressionist paintings and art deco art nouveau arts and crafts. The modern and contemporary collection was not as impressive but still covered the major ones like Warhol, Bacon, Rauschenberg, Jeff Koons...
