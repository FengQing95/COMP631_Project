Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Excellent.  Awesome decor and service.  The service was almost too attentive but the food was phenomenal.  We started out with crab cake which was mostly crab and little cake.  Top notch.  For entrees we order the ny strip steak that was cooked to perfection and flavorful, no fat at all. We also had the short rib stroganoff.  Spectacular.  Last but not least the Negroni cocktails were tasty.  Bavette's is a great spot for dinner or cocktails.  Cozy and hip
