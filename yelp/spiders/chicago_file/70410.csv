Little Goat Diner////We also had the salmon-pork belly salad, which had kale and winter greens and maybe celery or fennel in it, as well as red onion.  I listed all the things because the salad tasted completely homogenous: the dressing overwhelmed all the flavors, including the salty pork belly bits (which acted like croutons) and the bland salmon and even the bite of red onions.  Tamarind dressing, and I love tamarind (Vietnamese hot and sour soup, anyone?) but ugh.
