The Purple Pig////The only negative that I can say about this place involves the front of house and their quoted wait times. This is the second visit in a row that has been quoted at an hour wait and we've been seated in less than 10 minutes. To me this is a negative because it means they don't have a handle on the system and if it flips the other way it will lead to a great deal of upset patrons.
