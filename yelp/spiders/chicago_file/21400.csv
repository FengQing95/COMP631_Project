Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Just to give you an idea of how much we ate - my mom and I ate all of the salad and spinach bread but only ate half of the small pizza and took the rest to-go to eat later. Overall, I thought this was a great place to try the deep-dish pizza: good service, good venue, good food. Check it out!
