Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Oh man, what a deep dish pizza and what a wait! Be prepared to wait for about an hour and a half but if you haven't experienced Chicago deep dish before then it is worth the time! You will understand once you take a bite into this pizza that requires a fork and knife! Savor each bite! Have a malort shot at one of the local pubs to make the night complete!
