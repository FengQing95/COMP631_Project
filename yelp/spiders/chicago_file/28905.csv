Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As a New Yorker getting a deep dish pizza I would first like to say that I have no ill will towards deep dish. Any combination of tomatoes, dough, and cheese is ok by me. This was pretty tasty. The dough was a little under cooked in certain parts and the sausage could have been better, but overall pretty solid. Had it with some Italian wine I bought from a store near by and it was great (artisan cellar). I got the "small" and it was more than enough for me (ate 3/4 and was very full, and I am on the small side).
