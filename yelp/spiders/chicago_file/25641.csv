Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Decent, but not worth the price. It's a nice atmosphere, but the thin crust pizza is often overcooked and crumbly, and the deep dish just doesn't have the depth of flavor I would like. They also have very few options for toppings. If I wanted to spoon tomato sauce into my mouth and nothing else...I would do that at home.
