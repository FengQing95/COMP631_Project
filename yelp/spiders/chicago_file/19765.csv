Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The atmosphere in here is great. I ordered a large thin crust to split with a friend the other night, so that it would come out sooner. I use the term "thin" loosely - even the thin crust is generously thick. Which is perfect. Ordered extra sauce as an additional topping and it was a game changer. I tell my out of town friends about Lou Malnati's all the time to make them jealous.
