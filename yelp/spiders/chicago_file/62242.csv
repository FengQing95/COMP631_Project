Smoque BBQ////The food at Smoque is just OK. The restaurant layout is kind of cramped, as a person waiting in line to place your order I felt as I if I was standing over the diners. As diner I felt like I was crammed with the other diners. The restaurant decor has the feel of a modern barbeque joint. The service is pretty simple, you place your order at the counter, Â then wait for your order to be called, take your try and bring your food to your table.
