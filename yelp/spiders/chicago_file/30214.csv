Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Worth the wait! It was about two hours from the time we put our names down to when we got our pizza, but every bite made up for it. The place was absolutely packed, so I was thankful that we could pre-order our pizza and simply get a text when our table was ready. That actually gave us time to do more sightseeing along the river while we waited, which was nice!
