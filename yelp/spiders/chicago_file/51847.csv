Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I'm a big fan of Spanish cuisine and overall I would say this place is a solid choice. The interior is quite interesting and the food was good. Service was solid as well. We got sangria which was delicious and a bunch of tapas. I think the only dish I didn't care for was the lamb skewer if I remember correctly. It was pretty dry. Otherwise everything was delicious. My biggest problem was this massive party sitting next to us that ordered platters of paella and didn't touch it lol. What a shame. It was honestly so disrespectful to the restaurant. What a bunch of schmucks. But anyways good food and old atmosphere! Would return.
