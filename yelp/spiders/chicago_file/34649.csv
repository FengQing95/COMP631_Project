Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Went for cocktails after work with about 30 of my friends and they had trouble accommodating us but after that, it was no problem and the food was fantastic, albeit a bit on the expensive side. Â A Dry aged ribeye is hard to find in Chicago. I'm not sure why people do a wet aged all over Chicago, but this place does steak right. A bit pricey with appetizers, drinks and desert but if you are going to skip a course don't let it be desert here.
