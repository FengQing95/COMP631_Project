Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Delicious food, nice atmosphere. I had a plethora of tapas and the seafood paella. The bacon wrapped dates were surprisingly filling and extra sweet. Â I liked the see-through salmon (actually see-through, but well-seasoned and succulent). Also, the chicken and pork croquettes were really tasty. There were several others too, but those were particularly memorable. I would recommend to others, and I'll find a reason to be back soon.
