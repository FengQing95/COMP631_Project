Little Goat Diner////Great food and interesting menu.  My group of 6 walked over from Parlor Pizza after not being served for 30 minutes.  We arrived at 1pm on Thursday and we're seated within 5 minutes despite the restaurant being packed.  Our food was delivered timely.  I had the fish tostados (and previously I've had the sloppy goat, spanish omlet, tuna melt, crab dip and they are all top notch).  One dish came out slightly behind the others and they were very apologetic and treated our entire party to cookies when we left.  You can never go wrong with the goat restaurants.
