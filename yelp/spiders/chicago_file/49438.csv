Smoque BBQ////This place is O.K. The ribs sure taste great, but the sauce is a little too acid for me. It's good, but not up to my expectations. The BBQ beans are pretty tasty, but because of the sauce they're a little harsh to the stomach as well. Just don't eat here too often and you should be fine. The place is always packed it's ridiculous. Where there's meat there's people I guess.
