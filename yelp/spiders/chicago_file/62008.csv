Smoque BBQ////4. The seating area is small, especially given the place's popularity at peak times. Come and sit, but don't expect this will be a place you should (or will want to) hang for an hour or more. Great for lunch or a stop for dinner on the way to something else, but you won't want to "make an evening of it" here.
