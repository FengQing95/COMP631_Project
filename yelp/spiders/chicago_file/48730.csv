Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great place for tapas and sangria! I have always had outstanding service here and have loved everything I have tried! The paella is good, but I generally prefer to stick to the tapas. My favorites are the bacon wrapped dates, brussels sprouts salad, ham croquettes, and the garlic shrimp. So delicious!
