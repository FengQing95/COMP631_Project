Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Not impressed. After waiting in line for an hour *when we were told it would only be 25 minutes* (called ahead to put our name on the list but the website phone number was wrong and it linked it to the other Lou Malnati's) we finally got seated. Once seated it took 15 minutes for someone to wait on us. When the waitress finally got there, she told us a pizza would take 45 minutes to make and we should have ordered it ahead of time....wish someone would have told us that. The tomato sauce on the pizza tasted like paste from a can AT BEST. To top it all off, management is very dismissive of their issues. I've had better deep dish pizza from Pizza Hut. Honestly, I would skip this place all together. I guess people in Chicago don't know real food.
