Smoque BBQ////The sides didn't disappoint at all.  I loved the vinegary cole slaw, which went well with the smokey BBQ, but the mac & cheese was freakin awesome!  The side was just the right amount of mac and hot creamy cheese.  I also got the Peach Cobbler which was really good.  The sides were small, but with all the meat I thought it was just the right amount.
