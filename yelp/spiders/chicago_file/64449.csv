Smoque BBQ////Check off another long time renowned Yelp bookmark.  We came by and picked up a carryout slab of St Louis ribs and they did not disappoint.  The ribs were lean and meaty, with an intense smoked flavor, and just the right touch of spiciness when accompanied with their sauce.   Hard to say if Smoque or any one particular rib joint is the "best", but Smoque certainly sets the bar for smoked style of ribs in our experience.  We also like LL Woods, and Famous Dave's for their style of rib preparation and flavoring.  We need to hit Lem's soon to compare.
