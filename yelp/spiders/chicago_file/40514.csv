Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The King of Hogsalt Hospitality restaurant group. This place is phenomenal. Atmosphere 10/10. The cocktails, the appetizers, the entree's. WOW. The penicillin is my favorite cocktail. The steak tartare is rich, bold, and delicious. Get the ribeye + frites. Best ribeye in Chicago by far. Make a reservation and secure a table. Otherwise, you will need to be snag a seat at the first come first served bar.
