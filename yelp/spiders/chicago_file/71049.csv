Little Goat Diner////Lunch/dinner have consistently disappointed - the Los drowned, fish tostadas, and kimchi burger did not live up to expectations. They were just blah. The Los drowned was too fatty and somewhat hard to eat as the sandwich is full but you'll want to dip it into the accompanying sauce. The fish tostadas were too salty for my taste. Kimchi burger was underwhelming.
