Little Goat Diner////The Bull's Eye French toast is amazing!  I completely forgot that this dish was served with egg, and was pleasantly surprised when I cut into the thick, fluffy onion brioche, and discovered the egg had been cooked inside the French toast.  The French toast was topped with crispy chicken and BBQ maple syrup.  The portions are perfect, I didn't leave feeling hungry OR overstuffed.
