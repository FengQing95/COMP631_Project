Little Goat Diner////Best meal I had on my short trip to Chicago. The pork belly pancake was not what I expected (I didn't expect an Asian Fusion type dish) but it was SO GOOD. It is a Chinese style scallion (green onion) pancake topped with a large chunk of pork belly and a deliciously dressed bok choy salad over that. I've had better green onion pancakes at Chinese restaurants, but the combination of all the elements made up for that by far. I also got to try some of the BLT omelette special and that too was excellent. I can't wait to come back!
