Art Institute of Chicago////We bought a dual ticket with the Sears Tower Sky Deck and it was good for 48 hours.  We used the Art Institute ticket on Sunday Sep 27th.  The people are friendly and its guarded like the Vatican.  You can't get too close to things without setting an alarm off, so be careful.
