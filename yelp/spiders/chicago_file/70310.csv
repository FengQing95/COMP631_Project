Little Goat Diner////I love this place! Both times we've been here we've been able to get a seat outside and the wait time was minimal. The menu is comfort food with a twist, they aren't combinations that I would think to put together but they taste amazing! Next time we are in the city on a sunny Saturday or Sunday morning we'll be back!
