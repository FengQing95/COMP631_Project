Art Institute of Chicago////This place has been a staple for my wife and I. So tasteful, full of magnificent works of art, contributing to the community, and treating its members well. If you're visiting, you must stop by. You won't regret it! If you're a local, become a member. You get complimentary coffee in the members seating area and get to bring a guest. What more could you ask for for around $100 a year??
