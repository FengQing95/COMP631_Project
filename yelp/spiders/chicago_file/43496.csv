Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I took my students here on a field trip about 3 years ago and had a great experience.  They made it so easy to organize and the food was great.  The teachers definitely enjoyed it more than the kids ("cuándo vamos a comer los tacos, srta???"- it didn't matter that we had explained that Spanish food did not equal Mexican food about 100 times prior to the trip!).
