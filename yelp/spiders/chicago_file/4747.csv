The Purple Pig////The two best dishes were easily the broccoli (I know, right?!) and the octopus, which was not only crazy tender, but had the most perfect char  on it.  Honestly, those two dishes alone would be enough for me to re-visit.  The broccoli had this addicting sauce that coated every inch of it and it was just as good as Girl and the Goat's broccoli. Vegetables really stepped up their game lately.
