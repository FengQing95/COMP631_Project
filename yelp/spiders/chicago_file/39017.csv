Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Anyway, during our appetizer we were presented with a glass of wine....John explained that Bavette's has a "Bring your own" policy - but if you do, you're asked to share a glass with another party. So we were fortunate enough to be the recipient of a lovely Spanish red from the couple in the booth next to us. What a great policy/touch (especially when you are on the receiving end LOL)
