Art Institute of Chicago////The single best attraction in the City of Chicago.  The AIC is one of the world's best museums.  The strength lies in the breadth of its collection.  In this sense, it's a bit like a smaller version of the NYC's Metropolitan Museum of Art.  The French impressionism collection is particularly impressive and the modern collection is also quite good.  My only quibble is that the contemporary art collection borders on abysmal.
