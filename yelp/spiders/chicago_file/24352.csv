Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So I've come to stand still, to which family owned Pizzeria serves up the best deep dish. Both are fantastic and both are affordable as a family of 4 can fill up on a medium pie. While the prices may seem steep ($20-$30) you can, and probably will be, stuffed with 1 slice. I thought I was going to be pizza-d out for awhile and as I type this, I'm already craving a slice...Lou Malnatis for the Tie!
