Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My go to pizza place in Chicago.  I ship it out to my kids in California and they are always thrilled to get some Lou Malnati's!  My favorite is "The Lou" with spinach, mushrooms, 4 cheeses and roma tomatoes on top.  I also love the Malnati's salad. Service isn't the best but the pizza is superb.
