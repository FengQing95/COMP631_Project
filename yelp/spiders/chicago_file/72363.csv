Little Goat Diner////We wanted to like this restaurant so badly.  Great location, great decor, and friendly staff, but sadly it was the food that is getting the two star ratings.   My husband for the Reuben sandwich and I the braised beef sandwich (Los Dunk I think?) mine was supposed to be braised which to me means tender meat.  This was a poor piece of beef cut in big slices and reheated on the flat top, causing it to be so tough I couldn't but through any part of it and full of fat. It came with an awesome dipping sauce, but there was so much wetness from all the other stuff they put on the sandwich it was already falling apart before I picked it up.   Same for my husband, way too much sauce on his sandwich.  Total bill with tip $90 for two drinks, two crappy sandwiches, (no sides) and a kids meal and drink!
