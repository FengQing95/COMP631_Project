Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The greatest contribution to the work lunch experience in this area.  Very similar to Yolk, but a more extensive menu.  You can get breakfast, benedicts, omelets, pancakes, french toast, sandwich, salads, all under one menu.  Good swift service.  better not go at 12:30p.m./1 p.m. the prime lunch hour though.  Still, tables move fast.
