Art Institute of Chicago////Visiting museums is something I try to do in every city I visit. The Art Institute of Chicago makes all other museums seem weak in comparison. It had been a long time since my last visit, but I was mesmerized all over again. The opulent marble interior takes me back in time and ascending that regal staircase feels so timeless!
