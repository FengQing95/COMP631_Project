Smoque BBQ////We waited in line outside for about 30 minutes..and to think I actually considered turning around and leaving b/c I was starving!  This place has it down.  It was cracking me up the tourists taking pictures w/ the owner b/c he was on TV.  Um, no one actually know who that is, you know that right?  But he was super nice and checking on everyone.  There was such limited space I was wondering if we should get it to go.  But it seemed like when someone was ready to sit - a seat was available.  Unfortunatley, it's family style seating and we got sat next to 4 older ladies talking about dirty glasses at a bar and some other stuff...SO not appetizing while you're eating!
