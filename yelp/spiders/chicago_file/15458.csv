Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ok have not had a Chicago deep dish pizza in a long time - this was definitely one of the best I have had in many years.  In my mind the sauce on a pizza always makes the difference and there sauce was amazing.  The service was wonderful and the restaurant itself was very nice. Definitely bookmarked on my yelp account!
