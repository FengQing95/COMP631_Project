Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They have an awesome system going on where you can order your pie at a counter right after you walk in. Since the deep dish takes a hot minute to bake, this streamlines the process for both the guest and the business. You smart little cookies! I'll never skip this place when I visit Chicago!
