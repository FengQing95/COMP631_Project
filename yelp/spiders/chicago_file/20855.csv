Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm from out of town.  Wanted some Chicago Deep Dish.  I ordered the small Chicago classic.  It was okay, nothing to rave about.  I've had better deep dish in Dallas Texas.  Ordered the small, ate three slices.  Felt okay when I left, but about 20 minutes later my stomach felt as if I ate an entire large.  Decided to take a hour nap to sleep it off.  Woke up later with a bad headache and stomach still hurting.  Had to throw up to relieve some of the pain.  Terrible night.
