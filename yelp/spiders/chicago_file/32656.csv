Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////2nd time eating there.  2 people ordered bone in delmonico strip steaks.  Not good.   Very difficult to cut through.  You shouldn't have any trouble cutting your steak at a high quality steak place.  First time was MUCH better.   Had the seafood tower.  Good cocktails.  Probably won't go back.
