Art Institute of Chicago////Now that I have that out of the way. The museum is spectacular - as are the rotating exhibitions, permanent collections, architecture, atmosphere, staff, docents, etc. etc.  I highly recommend checking out the various talks, tours, and events they have daily at the museum. It adds substantial value (without cost - in most cases) to your visit and your greatly enhances your enjoyment of the art and your visit.
