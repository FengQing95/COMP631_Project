Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////There is always a rivalry in the city over which deep dish pizza is the best between Lou Malnati's, Giordano's, Gino's East, etc. I have had Lou's multiple times and is personally not my favorite. I think the crust isn't as flavorful as Giordano's. It's still a solid pizza place for out of town guests but would not be my top choice.
