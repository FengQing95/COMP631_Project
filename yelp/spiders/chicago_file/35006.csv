Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I'm looking at reviews for streak houses and I realized that we'd come to Bavette's about a year ago, but I forgot to write a review.  This place was very memorable so I don't know how I forgot.  We started out with Terrines.  I had the Foi Gras Terrine and my date had the Duck Terrine. I really loved my terrine, but my date did not like the duck terrine.  I just checked their menu and it seems they don't make Foi Gras Terrine anymore.  It did not seem to be a big hit.  My only complaint was that the appetizers were too large.  By the time we finished them we were both rather full and had to force ourselves to eat entrees.
