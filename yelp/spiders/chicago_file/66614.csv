Little Goat Diner////lst visit, bagels with a schmear and an espresso at the bar with a pal. I am a devotee of crusty, crispy Montreal-style bagels...these are not like that. These are not actually directly like any other bagel I've ever had. They're not American-pouffy, New York chewy or Montreal-crackling...they are compact, divinely flavorful and 'just-right' dense...And, my Everything bagel had the everything on the Inside - great idea and I didn't have to take a lint roller to my scarf afterwards. I picked the smoked salmon CC and it was lush. The espresso (Stumptown coffee) was...a great espresso, good crema, not bitter at all...and still hard to come by in most neighborhoods (but not this one). On that trip I took a loaf of Fat Bread home (with a smoked duck fat base) for an orgiastic two-day tour of applications that included absurdly good french toast, the greatest grilled cheese sandwich ever and just rippin and dippin with good olive oil.
