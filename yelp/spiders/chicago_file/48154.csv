Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We had three tapas: garlic shrimp, hanger steak, and a squid. The garlic shrimp and the squid were quite good, and I will probably order them again next time. We also had two servings of paella (we really wanted to order one, but two is the minimum), which was very good. The sangria was just mediocre, not impressive at all. But I have to say, everything is overpriced here...
