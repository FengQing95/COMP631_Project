Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of my dining companions made a fascinating observation about the waitstaff. Service here is really good, fast and friendly, but there's some subtle (and totally understandable) passive-aggressive behavior going on: The waiters like to direct sangria-sloshed stiletto-wearing drunkorexic loudmouths to the bathroom that's at the bottom of a rather steep flight of poorly-lit stairs, rather than the one that's right next to the table where the eight blondes with identical caramel lowlights are sitting. I watched half a dozen girls (one wearing a tiara and sequined "Bride-to-be!" sash) gingerly navigate the stairs and thrilled with pride when I was pointed to the convenient bathroom, which was totally empty. Maybe the downstairs bathroom has TVs in every stall showing Sex and the City reruns...
