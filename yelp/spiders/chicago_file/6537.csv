The Purple Pig////Their MUSHROOM AGNOLOTTI would have been delicious if it were not overwhelmed by the strong lemon juice flavor. In contrast to the cauliflower, where a hint of lemon enhanced the veggie; here the lemon flavor was so strong that it completely overpowered the mushrooms, which should have been the centerpiece of the dish.
