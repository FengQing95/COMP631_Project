Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My husband and I chose Lou Malnati's for our Valentine's Day wedding dinner. We wanted our out-of-town family to have a Chicago-style meal. We didn't go thru catering because we didn't want all pizza and salad. I love the Talapia Piccata! I called 5 hours beforehand and the man on the phone carefully took my order being careful to get the details.
