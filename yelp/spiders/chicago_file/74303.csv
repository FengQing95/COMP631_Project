Little Goat Diner////For food I really wanted to try the goat because... well you get it. I ordered the Patty Melt and subbed out Slagel Farms for goat, medium. It was very tasty and if you close your eyes you'd be hard pressed to tell me it was goat. I can't decide if this makes me happy or disappointed, but either way it was definitely a stronger taste than your every day beef patty. Had a decent amount of grilled onions and a few large slices of pickle which added a nice balance. It was juicy and reminded me a bit of lamb, my only negative comment is I think the bread to meat ratio is a little off as at points I got huge mouthfuls of goat meat while at others I was rounding the corners of the bread. My girlfriend wanted breakfast and ordered the Bull's Eye French toast - which came with a egg cooked in the center of a waffle, fried chicken pieces, and strawberries. Each item was great on its own so the combination set sweet, salty, fried, crunchy, ooey, gooey, etc. Oh we also ordered the elotes to share which was very tasty and just what you'd expect from the geniuses in the kitchen. I'd recommend Little Goat to anyone because their menu is extensive, inexpensive, and not for the apprehensive.
