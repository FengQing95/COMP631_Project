Little Goat Diner////The openness of the restaurant and the light coming in from the windows was a pleasant reminder that sunshine and spring-time are just around the corner.  The mirrors made the restaurant feel airy and spacious. I loved the cute goat-themed details in everything from the logo on the plates to the adorable paper napkin ring.  Just being in this place makes you warm and fuzzy inside.
