Little Goat Diner////Me and my friend happened upon The Little Goat diner, when we were planning on going to Au Cheval, but realized the wait was 3+ hours, and didn't want to wait, so we needed to find somewhere else to eat in the area, since it's a little bit from Downtown, just meaning you can't walk back into the city. So we walked down the street and this looked cute and the prices were very reasonable. We both got burgers which were great, perfectly juicy, the one I ordered reminded me of an upscale In'n'out, which is always a good option! Don't forget to take pics in the photo booth inside!
