Art Institute of Chicago////This is in my list of Top 5 US museums. It is the second largest museum in the US, behind the Metropolitan Museum in NY, which is quite telling. I will say that there is a story behind the way the art is grouped together, where the rooms seem to flow into one another for each time period and artistic theme.
