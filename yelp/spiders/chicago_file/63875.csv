Smoque BBQ////Took my parents and middle son here for the best BBQ chicago has to offer and it didn't disappoint at all!  Once again, had the spicy ass BBQ Gumbo - yes, I said BBQ gumbo - which is incredible!  The beans are incredible, the meat excellent, and the Carolina sauce insatiable!  Want BBQ in Chicago?  Kill yourself if you go elsewhere!  Lol
