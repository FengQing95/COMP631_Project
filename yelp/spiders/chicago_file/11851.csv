Art Institute of Chicago////We came to check out the special Japanese exhibit. Check it out before it's gone if you can. Super cool. Â We came today to celebrate my mom on her birthday to see something she would have loved to see on it. I know when planning it was towards the end of the exhibit's run. The whole thing was gorgeous.
