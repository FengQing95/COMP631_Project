Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My eagerness to try these famed pizzas diminished with every minute I waited for the pizzas to come out of the oven; they took almost 40 minutes!  I recommend that you do not come here while you are famished.  Or, be smart and order an appetizer to tide you over to the main course.
