Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place was excellent.  The ambiance is awesome.  Very Hugo's Cellar looking.  We just had drink and pomme frites with a rib eye.  The fries were good.  You know.  They were fries lol.  The garlic aioli was good but a bit mayonaisey for my taste and coulda used more garlic.  But the fries were good and crisp and stuff but the steak....was AWESOME.  Seared to perfection and cooked perfectly as well.  Absolutely fantastic.  The bartenders were also awesome.  Friendly, great service.  Can't wait to go back and try more stuff there. :)
