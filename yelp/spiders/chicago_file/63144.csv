Smoque BBQ////I wish that Smoque still did the smoked salmon special on Easter weekend. I'm pretty sure this hasn't been offered in years, but I still think about that smoked fish from time to time. Word was that they didn't sell enough portions that weekend and lost money on it. Had I only known, I would have purchased all the salmons.
