Art Institute of Chicago////The bottom line: this place houses many famous works of art from Picasso to Warhol to Serrat  and does it in a classy way.  I was extremely impressed by not only the pieces of art here, but by the architecture of the museum itself and the way in which each room was tailored to reflect the pieces of art that were housed within it.  If you visit Chicago, you should definitely check this place out.
