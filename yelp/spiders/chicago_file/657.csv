Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////My family ate here during our visit to Chicago last week. The food was phenomenal! My husband and I both got the farm fresh eggs with hashbrowns, fruit, and pancakes. It was all fresh and very tasty. My kids got the cinnamon roll pancakes and they ate every bite. The bacon was thick cut and perfectly fried, the fruit was sweet and juicy, the pancakes were fluffy, and the orange juice tasted like they had gone to Florida and picked it that morning. The service was fast and friendly and the restaurant itself was very clean. This will be our breakfast stop every time we go to Chicago!
