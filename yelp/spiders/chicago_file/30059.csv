Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou is very generous with his ingredients and even Mr. Creasote himself couldn't eat more than three slices of this. The cheese layer was at least a quarter inch thick and when you lifted a slice out of the box, it would raise up more than 24" and still have molten cheese connected to the remainder in the box! For the sausage is almost like they covered the whole surface with a big sausage patty!
