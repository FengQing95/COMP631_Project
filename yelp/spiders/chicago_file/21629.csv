Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great lunch spot. We snuck in before the lunch risk started and were immediately seated upstairs. The rustic feel to it was inviting, complete with chic Edison bulbs everywhere. We were greeted quickly by our waitress who was friendly and accommodating and provided great recommendations for beverages, salads, and pizza. We started with a few beers, surprisingly ones from Michigan, but delicious and lived up to their name.
