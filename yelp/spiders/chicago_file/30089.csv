Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Chicago is known for deep dish pizza and so that was what my friends and I were set out to try. Lou Malnati's was recommended by both of my friends as Giordano's was deemed the tourist trap. We got one small pizza (meant to share between two people). I wanted The Lou for that garlic butter crust but my friends wanted the Classic since it had meat. We were able to compromise and get our pizza ordered half Lou and half Classic.
