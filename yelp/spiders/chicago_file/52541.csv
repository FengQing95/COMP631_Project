Smoque BBQ////The pulled pork sandwich is the best I've ever had.  It's amazing how the delicious bun soaks up all the bbq sauce!  I love taking my co-workers here for lunch during the week and my friends on the weekend.  My friends and co-workers love the chopped brisket.  You can also get a sandwich that is half and half to try both the chopped brisket and the pulled pork.  Very friendly staff.  I've only had great experiences here.
