Smoque BBQ////I find it difficult to find new restaurants for my 8yr old picky daughter with an all nut and sesame allergy to enjoy. We all loved it! Tender and delicious brisket sandwich and mini pork sandwiches. A gentleman behind the counter was transparent with allergy information and reassuring that it was safe for my daughter to eat the food. I also appreciate it that he shared his own son had a nut allergy & always ate there. If it weren't for my amazing dentists next door which gave me a gift card, I would have never tried it (restaurant is not close to my home) Thank You!! and we'll be returning, Â but this time with the hubby.
