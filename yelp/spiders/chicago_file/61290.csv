Smoque BBQ////Everyone loves Smoque and now I know why...pulled pork, sliced brisket, french fries and baked beans were all incredible.  My friend Ian recommended grabbing some candied jalapenos to go with my meal; I thought those were okay, but everything else was quite tasty.  I would certainly say that for the price and the amount served, a half-sandwich with one side is certainly enough for most regular people during the work day, and enough for my 5'3" wife any time!  Will be back for sure to take advantage of the outdoor seating.
