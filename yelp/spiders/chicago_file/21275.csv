Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We went to Lou's ordered two pies. The Signature Pie and a Cheese with peppers and onions. Both pies were fantastic. Lou's approach to deep dish or appears to be taking a thinner crust (not wafer thin but not a huge rising crust) and form it into a deep dish pan. This crust is amazingly crisp and tasty. After the crust it is a thicker layer of very fresh clean tasting mozzarella cheese, not really greasy at all. Then it is a loaded layer of house made sausage very flavorful and loaded across the whole pie. Finally, there is a very hearty fresh tasting layer of sauce to cap off the entire pizza. It was very tasty and much fresher not greasy pizza.
