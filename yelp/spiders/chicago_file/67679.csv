Little Goat Diner////If you're looking for eccentric diner food, then Little Goat is the place to be! I ordered the Tuna Melt and expected a normal melt, but I received a Tuna Melt that looked very unique and different. The sourdough bread was placed on the bottom, while the albacore tuna, nicoise salad and the cheese sauce were placed on top. The presentation was amazing and the taste lived up to the expectations according to the appearance. Little Goat was a great go to for lunch, but they tend to get very busy during lunch so get there early!
