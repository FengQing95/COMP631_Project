The Purple Pig////Stopped by for a late bite for lunch after the Architectural River Cruise.  The Purple Pig was warm and toasty and the staff was welcoming.  Since I was alone I squeezed in at the bar.  James immediately offered me water and menus.  The Purple Pig has a variety of small plate offerings and I decided on the meatballs and a nice glass of an Italian Red that James suggested (which was also reasonably priced.). The meatballs were served with a toast crisp, ricotta cheese sauce and arugula salad.  The meatballs were soft and rich and the salad was a nice accompaniment.  All in all it was the perfect mini-lunch and warmed me up from the inside out after the cold air on the river cruise!  Bonus points for having purse hooks at the bar.
