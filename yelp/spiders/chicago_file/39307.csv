Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Reasonably good food. Very arrogant vibe. We travel the world and feel qualified to present an honest  objective review.  4% Covid fee is in this caliber restaurant just greedy and arrogant. One daughter here, one in Manhattan NY; have had no Covid surcharges yet in " fine dining" here or NYC. We asked the waiter if he could add some chopped tomatoes to our wedge salad. He told us that to do that the " kitchen makes him go to the cellar and bring up a tomato and chop it himself" "the kitchen does not use any tomatoes " So, with that pushback we said ok/NM. But one fillet had a fresh roasted tomato on it. Waiter gave us a BS story. That was the difference between a 15% and 25% tip. Lots of better restaurants around w less arrogant vibe; Not worth the aggravation. Peter Luger restaurant in NYC was recently  blasted by the NY Times because the arrogance finally won and the restaurant is nearly done.
