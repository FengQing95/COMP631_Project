Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We were mostly vegetarian and ordered mostly vegetarian dishes. Mushroom and goat cheese dishes were excellent; the Moroccan chickpea stew and brussels sprouts salad were a little too sweet but otherwise tasty. They have a good deal for wine flights, which I enjoyed (even if one of the glasses arrived wet, i.e., freshly washed but not dried). I wish there were more green things on the menu, but this is a chronic problem with the tapas I have experienced. Desserts were mediocre.
