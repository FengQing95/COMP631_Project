Little Goat Diner////Hmmmm.  So we had been drinking at the Cubs and then we had gone to Soho House for drinks and fries with friends who are members and then it was around 6:30 and time to head home but one more drink for the road.  After trying to get a table st a few places, we managed to sit at the diner bar area here.
