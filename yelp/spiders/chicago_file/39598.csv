Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Be warned. If you go, make a reservation for the dining room, even though it is noisy with chatter and clanking dinner ware. At least they play jazz in there. Stay out of the downstairs Parlor unless you prefer your expensive steak served alongside something that sounds like a filthy 2 Live Crew album....
