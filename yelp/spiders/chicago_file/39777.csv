Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I can say that it is the best steak I've ever had, they serve the food so fast, which is good for not waiting so long. They also have burgers and fries that can be a side dish for your steak, the burger they made was so great! Also their fries, it is so yummy and crispy. They have drinks too. Their drinks especially the wine is highly recommend. This Bavette's Bar & Boeuf can give a big, big incredible dining experience! If you have not been at this place, please go and try some of their dishes.
