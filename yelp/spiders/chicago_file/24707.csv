Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered 1 small The Malnati Chicago Classic with butter crust and the regular Malani salad, all to share. Salad came out first. It is a good size salad. We were glad that we didn't order the family size. It was tasty. My partner is a carnivore and he didn't mind the Malani salad.
