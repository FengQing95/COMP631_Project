Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////A very nice selection of small plates, served quickly. We shared a number of the tapa offerings and they were all very good. Often times the calamari (squid) is rubbery but this dish was very well prepared and flavorful. Not rubbery at all. We shared a pitcher of sangria and really enjoyed the fact that we were able to taste a few of the offerings before finally landing on the preferred flavor. The servers were all very pleasant and efficient. I'd go back if I were in that neighborhood again.
