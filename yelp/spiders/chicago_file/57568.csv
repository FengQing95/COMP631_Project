Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This restaurant gets super busy so make sure to make a reservation well in advance! This was one of my favorite spots I dined at in Chicago - the food and drinks were delicious! It's tapas style here- some come ready to try different dishes. The standouts to me were the red sangria, octopus, croquette, goat cheese, and the paella. There is also a cute ambiance to this restaurant and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful in deciding which dishes to order.
