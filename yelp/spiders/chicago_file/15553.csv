Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza was delicious the service great. The tables were unlaquered wood. And accumulated grime could be scrapped thru with a fingernail. Along with crayola marks. When it was brought to the servers (and hopefully managers attention) we were moved to another table in no better condition. Later while we ate a young man cleared the table and wiped it down with a damp rag. It did no good. This accumalated grime could and probably does hold any number of bacterial baddies. So please don't let your food hit the tables surface. Maybe paint the tables so aforementioned damp rag might do some good.
