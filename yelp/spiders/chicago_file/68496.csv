Little Goat Diner////Came here on a Sunday and there was maybe a 20-minute wait. The food is very good and not too expensive. The portions are ginormous, so be prepared to take home leftovers! I had a Korean pancake dish that was really flavorful, and we also ordered a chickpea salad and a goat burger that were divine. The food is a bit on the heavier side so I don't know if I would come here every day, but it was solid.
