Little Goat Diner////The restaurant accommodated our group in a large booth for brunch. We had ordered a personalized cake a few days prior and it was cut and served to us. That was nice, otherwise, the service was really just ok. The waitress had to be flagged down for coffee refills and we waited f.o.r.e.v.e.r for our check.
