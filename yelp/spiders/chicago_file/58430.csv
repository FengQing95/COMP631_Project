Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We went in Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba for a Sunday brunch. We ordered the platter and two tapa dishes. The platter consisted of both sweet and savory bites of food. All of them were great, but personally I liked the toast the best. The tapa dishes were also very delicious. The Benedict egg with prosciutto were smooth and tasty, the potato was baked and spiced with a strong spicy flavor. The "cubano" sandwich were also delicious, the toasted bread with a mouthful of meat were very fulfilling.
