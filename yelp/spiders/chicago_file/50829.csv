Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Their happy hour is fantastic if you like sangria. And we're talking real sangria without the soda and juice filler that you get at so many places. A pitcher during happy hour is around $16 and perfect for 3-4 people if you each want a glass, or for 2 people if you're feeling a bit more adventurous :)
