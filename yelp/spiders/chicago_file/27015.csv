Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As a Chicago deep dish virgin, this was my first taste of an authentic pie. Â It was one of the highlights of our trip! This place was amazing, the charm of the inside sets the mood, and the pizza just brings it home. It was SO amazing. I was pumped when I saw that we can actually ordered them online to be shipped home. It has taken my online shopping problem to a whole new level, haha.
