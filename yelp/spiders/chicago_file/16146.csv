Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Disappointing. My first taste of Chicago pizza, and I wished I was back home eating Little Star Pizza. I shared a small Lou's pizza ($12.45) and a small spinach salad ($6.50). Though we ordered the butter crust as many reviewed on, I don't think they actually made it with it since we were not charged for it. This pizza was not topped with crushed tomatoes like many of the other pizzas, but was topped with sliced tomatoes and cheddar. The pizza did not impress me at all, and left me wishing we had tried somewhere else like Uno's. The spinach salad was the highlight with crumbled bits of fried salami on top.
