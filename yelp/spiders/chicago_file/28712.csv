Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We've also had the deep dish here. Although we don't like deep dish if we had to chose between this and Giordanos we prefer Lou's. The crust and sauce are much better. It's a little less thick which makes it easier to eat and feels more like a pizza. The deep dish here doesn't feel like you're eating a brick of cheese.
