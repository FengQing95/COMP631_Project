Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Looking for a better place? Try Beatrix at W Fulton Market. Really awesome food and the service was unlike anything I've experience before. Our friendly waitress knew it was my first time and walked us through the menu, answered all our questions. She was genuine and sweet. Â And even, even gave a rainbow toast on the house. First impressions mean everything, ever since then I've come back multiple times. You can't go wrong w Beatrix.
