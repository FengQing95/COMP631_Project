Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great place, the food portions are meant to be small and not too expensive so u can get a lot and try a lot. Great sangria (my favorite is the original) the pitchers are good for groups coming in. The bacon wrapped dates and shrimp are delicious, the stand outs. The fried calamari and steak were pretty good too, not amazing but definitely good.
