The Purple Pig////Ok, I am in LOVE with the Purple Pig! Situated in the heart of downtown, the Purple Pig boasts a fabulous tapas-style menu. While they take no reservations and can subject their guests to quite a wait. Miraculously, at 5pm on a Thursday, my sister and I were able to be seated right away.
