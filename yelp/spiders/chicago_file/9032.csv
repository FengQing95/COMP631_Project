Art Institute of Chicago////By far, this is probably the best American art museum. Unless you're a die-hard MOMA fan, you would probably agree with me. Inside, you can find some of the most famous works from across the ages and continents. I don't think you could capture the greatness and awesomeness in just one trip and/or one day. I would recommend at least a two day visit to grasp the magnitude of the collection as a whole.
