Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Unfortunately, we had a bad experience with their delivery. We ordered a deep dish and a thin crust. We bit into the thin crust and - wait a minute - there's no meat! I was sharing a pizza with a meat lover and he immediately noticed the pepperoni's weren't there. We dug under the cheese and sauce, but still the meat eluded us. We quickly called the pizzeria and spoke with the manager. He explained that they had burned our original pizza and had to make us a second one, but that he was sure the pepperoni's we were added. We assured him they were not, so he said he'd refund us for that pizza. I'll give an update if the refund actually goes through.
