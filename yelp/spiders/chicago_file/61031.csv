Smoque BBQ////They have their own parking lot, and we had no trouble with street parking. Walking up to the restaurant, the outdoor seating section looked lovely (unfortunately, it was full - at 5:30 PM on a Friday, so go early). We walked inside and were told by the busboys they'd "seat us" after we placed an order, but the inside was completely empty and basically had cafeteria-style seating, so, um...okay. Dress code? Feel free to show up in your sweatpants (not necessarily a complaint, ha).
