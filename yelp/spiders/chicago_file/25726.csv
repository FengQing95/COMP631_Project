Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my first time trying Lou Malnati's. It was very delicious and flavorful. The buttery crust taste is yummy and the food was great. A good thing to know is that one or two slices of Chicago deep dish pizza will fill you right up. It also takes a while to make the pizza so it is a good idea to maybe get an appetizer. Honestly, this is my favorite restaurant in Chicago to get some deep dish pizza. I highly recommend Lou Malnati's Pizzeria.
