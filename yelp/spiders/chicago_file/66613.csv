Little Goat Diner////I've snacked in and taken out fresh baked goods twice. The stars have not yet aligned when me and the missus are both free for a full dine-in experience (but the kimchi reuben and Elvis waffles are on the list) and I'll update when I do but, even with my limited exposure, I can hand Little Goat a well deserved 5 stars.
