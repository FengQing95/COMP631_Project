Little Goat Diner////Really, really, really don't get what the fuss is about here. Food was spectacularly greasy and heavy. Had a hard time finding anything we wanted to eat. Glorifying fat is lazy in my opinion. Work harder to coax great flavors and textures with less fat, please! Surely that's what a Top Chef should be able to do, yes?
