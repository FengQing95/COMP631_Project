Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As for the food... Get the prime bone in ribeye.  It is SO TENDER, and literally just melts in your mouth.  I dream about this steak.  Had the pomme frites, the crab cake, and creamed spinach... all good.  But the standout side is THE BACON.  May seem weird as a side, but just get it and thank me later.  Also the best I've ever had.
