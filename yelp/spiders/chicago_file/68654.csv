Little Goat Diner////The missing one is for the god-awful bartender on the Bread side at night. Neck-beard (I'm sure that doesn't round it down too much but oh well), you know who you are. Its fine that you don't know how to make a Sazerac, "oh you don't want ice in it?". That's ok - no big deal. It's that you were a complete and utter a-hole to me. Yelling at me "Mark WHAT!?" when i was trying to get my bill to PAY YOU.
