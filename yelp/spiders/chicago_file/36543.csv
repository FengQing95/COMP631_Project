Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Wow! That is the appropriate word for my experience at Bavette's.  The décor was dark and intimate. I have never had skirt steak that was so succulent and tender. The Béarnaise sauce that accompanied it was an absolute dream. The frites and the aioli were just as good.  Service even at the bar was impeccable.  I only planned on having one drink, but my Gimlet was so good I ordered another one and I truly just enjoyed the ambience.  I am definitely coming back to Bavette's next time I am in Chicago
