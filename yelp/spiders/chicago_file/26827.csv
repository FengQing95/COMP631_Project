Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They have a personal size (practically a meal) for $6.  It took about 20 minutes to make, which was pretty quick.  It came in piping hot.  I was eating it on my way to the airport in a cab, but it didn't make it any less delicious.  It was cheesy, with chunks of tomato and a crunchy crust.  I highly recommend if you're in a rush.  It was also not that messy, able to eat with a fork if you tried.  Also -- loved that crushed red paper flakes and parm cheese was included.  Thank you Lou for being my first real deep-dish pizza experience in Chi-town!
