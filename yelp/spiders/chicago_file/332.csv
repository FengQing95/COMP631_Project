Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I liked the place, but it did not really distinguish it self.  Recently, I have been to other places that are much better for less money.  Their location is right near a lot of big hotels, so everyone there was eating with their kids.  This place is very popular for families traveling to Chicago.  The sausage was good ( a lot like Jimmy Dean's), but not special.  The pancakes again were good, but not better than other places.  If you are in area with your kids a good place to eat.
