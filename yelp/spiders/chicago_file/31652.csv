Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Overall, I personally wouldn't recommend this to travelers - but again, maybe my expectations were set too high. Oh and the pies aren't cheap! I didn't feel like we got the best deep dish pizza treatment here, but on the plus side, we had a great salad and our waitress was super nice!
