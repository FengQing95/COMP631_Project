Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Awesome decor, and design. They have a good wine selection. The food itself was very good as well. The kitchen had some issues so they gave us a bunch of free food to tie us over. They ended up taking off the wine and some of the food (which was impressive since I got a $120 bottle). I would come back for sure, this place is a gem. I would give 5 stars if we didn't wait over an hour for our food.
