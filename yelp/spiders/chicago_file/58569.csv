Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I can't give this place more than 2 stars. They claim to have authentic Spanish tapas. Have they been to Spain, because it seems like they have not? Some of their tapas are named correctly, but just not very good, others are just not accurate at all. I get it, the Lettuce Entertain You, strip on Halstead is geared towards upper middle class folks who want to live in the city, pretend to be cultured, but want the comfort of a suburban chain restaurant. I've been to Summer House, Stella Barra (when it was open), Crab Cellar and now Cafe ba-ba-Reba and I can honestly say, that I won't be back to any of them. Their wine menu was super expensive - $19 for a glass of wine? At that price I expect quality, which I did not get. Take this review for what you will, it is my opinion however, if you want authentic Spanish food this is not the place for you.
