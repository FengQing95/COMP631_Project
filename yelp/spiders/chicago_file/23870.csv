Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Okay... I am new at this Yelp review business, so I hope my vote counts.  I travel a lot for business, but there is no place like home.  I am a huge Pizza fan, HUGE!  When I go home, I don't go any where else for my PIE!  My favorite on this menu is the classic Pepperoni deep dish, awesome bruschetta, and cold beer.   My service provided is bar none, PERFECT.
