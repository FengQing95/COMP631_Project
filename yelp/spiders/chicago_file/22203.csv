Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm glad I decided to order this salad to balance out the platter of fried food and pizza. The salad was outstanding and not just a filler! I didn't even need salad dressing for it, but it became even tastier than I thought possible. When everyone was done with eating the salad, I finished it off.
