Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Had reservations for 630pm 09April waited 30 min to get our table   They sat us in the basement got stuck with a condescending waiter with a major attitude.  I went back a couple days later to complain. The manager says oh just make another reservation and we will make sure you get another waiter.  Yeah sure I'll get right on it.  Will definitely not be going back.  Food was ok nothing special for those prices.
