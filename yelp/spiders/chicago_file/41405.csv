Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place does not disappoint.  The food has always been great, the sangria is amazing and tonight, the customer service was unreal.  We got there with a reservation for 6 and had to wait maybe 20 extra minutes to be seated because of a mix up.  Wasn't a huge deal to us but the manager was so accommodating and apologetic.  Wasn't even expecting that when the bill came to us at the end of the night he apologized again for the wait and footed the bill for our entire meal.  That just doesn't happen!
