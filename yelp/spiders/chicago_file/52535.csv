Smoque BBQ////Pricey, but 1 rib dinner, 1 brisket dinner and a side of pulled pork and a Texas link fed myself and my husband for nearly 3 days, so overall a very good value.  Compared to my beloved Salt Lick, this is a four star joint. That being said, this is Chicago and if you love bbq, you need Smoque in your life, ASAP.  It surpasses the hype and truly raises Chicago bbq to a whole new level.
