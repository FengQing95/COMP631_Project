Little Goat Diner////My experience here, however, was completely saved by the nachos. It's a huge plate so definitely share. We got the pork and beans on the side since my boyfriend can't eat pork (the beans are cooked in pork fat). I actually thought the nachos were better this way and that they would be too heavy if the pork/beans were served on top. Anyway, the nachos were incredible! The chips were thickly cut and fried to perfection which supported all the toppings nicely without getting soggy. I loved the addition of the pickled onions as well, which added a fresh flavor to the otherwise very savory dish. I'd come back just to eat these nachos!
