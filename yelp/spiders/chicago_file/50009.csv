Smoque BBQ////after menu surfing while doing laundry i finally decided that it was time to try smoque. called up the place and ordered ummm...damn near close to everything on the menu...it all started as a chicken platter with mac n cheese and baked beans on the side then i added a taste of brisket and ribs and i had to have dessert right? so i added on peach cobbler...the price of all that was pretty decent as i think bbq places tend to be on the more expensive side. well, when i went to pick up the order turns out they heard "sausage" instead of "chicken" so I had to wait a little while and they threw in some sausages for the inconvenience. SCORE! i think that if i had ordered the pulled pork you could have branded me a carnivore and just performed a coronary bypass right then.
