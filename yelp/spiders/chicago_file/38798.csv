Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We're handed our menus, and it's at this moment I realize something is very wrong. I'd sat waiting all that time in the wrong place. Remember, I wasn't sure where we were, but I'd seen a valet stand with the name of the restaurant right next to the canopy. We'd waited an hour for a table at Gilt Bar--I'm embarrassed and inconsolable.
