Smoque BBQ////I haven't had good BBQ like this in so long. I live in Seattle and when I was home in Chicago to visit, a friend suggested BBQ. My sister recommended this place. As filled up as I was being on vacation and eating heavy foods all week, I went with it. So glad! I forgot how good BBQ is done. I got the half and half sandwich. The brisket was so tender, my teeth didn't know when it passed through the meat from the bread. The sauce was mild but good. The place is very organized so that no matter how busy they are, there's someone there to help guide you. Thanks Smoque for a great Chicago BBQ experience!
