Smoque BBQ////I'm not big on barbeque, but this place was great. I had the pulled pork sandwich, the corn bread, the mac 'n' cheese and the peach cobbler. it was fantastic! I was surprised at how quickly the place filled up. a line started to wrap around the outer exterior of the restaurant. if you've made plans to eat at Smoque and are anticipating yourself being hungry in an hour, I would suggest leaving for the restaurant then because there is a bit of a wait and after the wait you'll be famished.
