Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered a peperoni deep dish, and when we ordered our waiter said it would take 45 minutes. It took 45 minutes. However, when he brought it out, he said because it took so long he would give us a free dessert! Right on! The pizza was delicious, like I said I'm not a huge fan of deep dish because of the amounts of cheese they put on it, but we both cleared our plates.
