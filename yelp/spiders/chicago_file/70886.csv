Little Goat Diner////This is one of my favorite restaurants in the world.  Consistently above the bar,  and constantly changing.  Innovative, flavorful,  and subtle when it needs to be. Cheap,  with solid cocktails. You can expect things to be delicious, yet different.  I tried This little piggy went to China and the pork belly pancake,  but I'd bet that the menu changes by the time you visit.  No matter,  check this place out.
