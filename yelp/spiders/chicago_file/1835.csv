Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////My party arrived at about 10 AM on a Friday. We were quoted a 30-45 minute wait and were seated about 25 minutes later. I asked what decaffeinated tea they had, and the server brought out a large wooden box full of Tazo tea bags and had me pick out which one I wanted. My dad had about 500 questions about the menu but the server was really nice and patient. I was also pretty obnoxious, asking for a bowl of strawberries and a bowl of bananas to replace the hash browns and toast/pancakes that came with my omelette. I also requested that they go easy on whatever they cook the omelette in, and to my surprise the server said absolutely, and gave me three options: butter, Pam, or olive oil. I was told that the pancakes and skillet were incredible and my omelette was really flavorful. Highly recommended, I'll definitely be back.
