Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////When you walk in to this place...you just know you're in for a treat.  The atmosphere is  perfect and makes you feel at ease after a long week at the office.  There is plenty of space between tables and it isn't too loud inside like a lot of the trendy places in River North...this is a good thing, trust me.  I took my girlfriend here for a late reservation on Friday night for drinks and I was sad that I didn't save my appetite because everything on the menu looked delicious.  The table we had was spacious and I decided to go onto the "booth" side to be closer to my girl and check out the view...a good call on my behalf because otherwise I would have been very far away from her and the space itself screams out "be intimate!"  I don't recall the details of our order but I do know that I walked out with a big satisfied smile on my face as the overall experience was excellent..  Strongly reccomend this one to all to try.
