Art Institute of Chicago////Art institute of Chicago, this place is just perfect! I'm telling you all, for people that loves visualizing, or just simply view the beautiful arts created with such wonderful people, this is the best place for you to go to! And as an artist myself that had always been so fascinated by the neat and immaculate works of others, this is the place for me. The place is quite big and if you go inside, it is quite a quiet place, very calming and peaceful! The place itself is already a neat view, very organized and highlighted with artworks very pleasing to the eyes. I also have masterpiece for more than a century ago and this art institute brought that touch of beauty to the area it is in. Â The masterpieces inside are truly a work of art, a true masterpiece. By far one of the best art gallery I had ever been to.! I definitely recommend this place very much and for those fellow artist like me, this is the best place, definitely! Thank you!
