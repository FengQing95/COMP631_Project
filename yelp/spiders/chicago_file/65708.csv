Smoque BBQ////Only half of our party had arrived, so they wouldn't let us order. If we did, they couldn't guarantee seating for our whole party. I understand that there is limited seating and it's a popular place, but this rule was a pain in the butt. When the rest of our party did arrive, we ordered and waited a while to be seated because the rush that walked in earlier was happily eating. Luckily, they didn't prepare our orders until we had a table.
