Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So disappointed. Driving from Denver to Canton OH and stopped just to have their pizza and Salad. I was here about 7 years ago and it was so good I ordered pizza online. Today the salad was as good as I remember but the pizza was bland to say the least. I've never asked for salt when eating a pizza but I sure wanted to today. Going to Pizzaria Uno tomorrow so hopefully it will be better. 960 miles later just not worth the stop.
