Little Goat Diner////Oh how I wanted to love Little Goat! I am a huge Izzard fan and rave about Girl & the Goat. Our group of 4 made reservations for 8:15am on a Sunday morning, and when we entered, the only table available was the community table. Totally fine - except the other people at the table had 3 screaming children (one was running around in circles). Pass. So we waited 15 minutes for a quieter/private table. I hate when you make a reservation and the restaurant basically says "don't care" by not reserving a table for you. Strike one Mini Goat. We sat down at the table, and immediately were given cups for coffee - awesome! However, after about 15 minutes without coffee, I walked over to one of the waitresses and asked for some. In a few more minutes, we finally met our waitress who brought us decaf, which no one wanted. Strike two little goat. We ordered the ooey-gooey cinnabun to split and it was amazing. SO soft, gooey, warm and creamy. This was the highlight for the morning. We then waited about 45 minutes for our breakfast without any coffee or water refills and 0 check-ins from our waitress. When we got our food, we enjoyed it. I loved my sourdough pancakes, the bulls eye french toast was on target (pun intended) and the Elvis waffles had great flavor. We asked the waitress to box up our meals and after what seemed like forever more, she gave us our check and boxes. The boxes were each labeled with our meals which was very kind. However, upon getting home to eat the meals, I had been given my friends' food, and vice versa. Stirke three. Our bill for 4 people was $90 and I don't think Little Goat earned any of it. I will gladly go back to Girl & Goat, but will not be recommending Little.
