Art Institute of Chicago////The only disappointment was the gift shops, things were tacky and over priced. I was willing to spend some money on a nice piece of jewelry but it was all crap or way too expensive.  My poster was even $18 and it's not mounted or framed.  The books are outdated and old.  Other than that you've gotta stop by and take a look, they have a little something for everyone.  And a whole gallery of Toulouse Lautrec near the grand stair case!!
