Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////-Some dude comes waltzing up to our table, sleeves sloppily pulled up, tattoos up his arms [generally managers look more put together than that, also, this is our only way of identifying him] and from two feet away *condescends at us* "You're sure you don't want anything else?" Then proceeds to lean over, plant his hands on the end of the table like he's going to do push ups, and talk at us for a minute. Never apologizes. Never tries to make it better. Just talks at us, and walks away.
