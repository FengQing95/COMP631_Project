Smoque BBQ////went back to the hometown for the weekend and hit up smoque for lunch. we had the sliced brisket platter with mac & cheese and beans and pulled pork sandwich. now at first i was like WTF the portions got friggin tiny. few slices of brisket yet i remember the sides were on the smaller size. brisket was still delicious..meat falls apart and they got good bbq sauce. gobbled the platter up quickly but due to dipping in excessive amounts of sauce it made me content but not full. mac & cheese is crusty on top and gooey cheese delicious. baked beans here are prolly one of the best. they put bits of brisket or ribs so it's quite nice. can't wait until i go back home for some more!
