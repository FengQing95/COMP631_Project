Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our ultimate opinion of this place was that it was very good, although a little pricey and very, very crowded.  I wouldn't be opposed to coming here again but there are so many other tapas bars out there that I'd probably be more interested in trying the ones I haven't been to than coming to the same one again and again.
