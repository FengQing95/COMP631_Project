Smoque BBQ////Went in around 245 on a Sunday and there was a line that ran up to the entrance with almost all tables occupied. After placing my takeout order I stood close to where the food was going out and I have to say the efficiency of the restaurant is very good and the way it should be. All too often I observe issues at different places of business that could be fixed so simply!
