Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great intimate place to take your wife on a date.  Low light great atmosphere.  Main level was packed and noisy at 9:00 but we were taking down stairs to another room that had a bar and a dozen or so tables.  We couldn't have asked for a better place to eat. My wife got the lamb and I got the frites, thick cut bacon and bone marrow.  All of that was phenomenal at least I thought until they came back to give us the chocolate pie and lemon meringue pies we ordered.  It will be hard to top our experience at Bavette's.
