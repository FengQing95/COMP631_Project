Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've had steaks in many Chicago steakhouses (e.g. David Burke's, Tango Sur, Cut) and the filet at Bavette's was by far the best I've had.  Complement the dish with a side of their elote corn (a bit spicy if you can't handle the heat) and an Old Fashioned, and you'll be in heaven.  Conclude the feast with the golden brick dessert and you won't be disappointed.
