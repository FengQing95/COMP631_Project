Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Officially open for business but not officially promoting their opening (the soft open concept). I went last night and ate a lot, tried a lot of things and took a lot photos. No full review yet, it's soon soon after they are serving the public, but I'll post the pictures now. The decor, lighting and atmosphere alone will keep bavette's slammed, and then you get to enjoy the food and drink. Also, definitely check out the downstairs 'parlor'. I love the faux animals heads and the wood paneling combined with the original stone work. The music is a little more upbeat too which makes downstairs an awesome place to end the night, or any night.
