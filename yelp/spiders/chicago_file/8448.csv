Art Institute of Chicago////James Cuno, President and Eloise W. Martin Director of the Art Institute of Chicago introduced the wing to a group of about 100 people in the Griffin Court as they stood above the crowd on the stair case between the 1st and 2nd floors.  The Griffin Court makes up the main entrance to the Modern Wing and has ceilings soaring to the sky.  Even with the rain yesterday, the room was very light and bright due to this clean and modern design.
