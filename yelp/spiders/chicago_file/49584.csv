Smoque BBQ////I'm from Chicago, so my BBQ palate isn't quite as nuanced as someone from say, Texas. That being said, I came here with a coworker who grew up in Texas.  He got the beef brisket and proclaimed this place to be just as good as anything in Texas!!!  I've never been disappointed with Smoque. The ribs, the brisket, the pulled pork, it's all delicious.
