Art Institute of Chicago////This was fantastic. We came at 2 pm and it closes at 5 thinking it would be plenty of time - with one masterpiece after the next, how we wished we had just a little more time! Really enjoyed it. While the museum was busy on a Saturday, there was enough room so you never felt overcrowded. We did not pay to see the special exhibit but the rest was so good I found no need, although I am sure it was excellent since everything else was. There is a small cafe that serves coffee, wine, and desserts and such, but it was closed when we reached it around 4 pm. I would highly recommend this museum as a highlight of any visit to Chicago.
