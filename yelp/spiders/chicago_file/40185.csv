Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Visiting Chicago for the first time with my husband for our 4th wedding anniversary. This was the first restaurant we visited there and I can't say enough about how delicious and authentic the food is!!! The servings are pretty big so we had a salmon Caesar salad, the garlic mashed potatoes, mac and cheese and the shrimp scampi. My husband also had the best old fashioned ever, made by Emily, our server. Emily was simply amazing! She was extremely patient and helpful, and made sure that we enjoyed our experience. I highly recommend this place, just make sure you leave enough room to eat because you will need it!!!
