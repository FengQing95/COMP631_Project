Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I am in love with this place.  This was one of my first tapas experiences and it was great.  All the sangria is excellent as I split all of the flavors with my date.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  Some of the best things- the baked goat cheese, the spicy potatoes with tomato aioli, the beef empanada and the beef skewer.  I wish I could have tried everything but you know, money.  This is the perfect place to have a fun night out with friends or a date as well.
