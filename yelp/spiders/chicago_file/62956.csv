Smoque BBQ////Too much hype! BBQ is good, but certainly not worth the long lines, high prices and small portions. And if you're lucky enough to get a seat after waiting in a long line and spending $30 for a plastic tray with a small portion of BBQ, the cafeteria-style seating sucks. We were packed in like sardines at long tables and bright lights. Save time and money by skipping this place.
