Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Their cold tapas, Tortilla Espanola, Queso Manchego, Aceitunas, Yum, I love being able to order more than just one dish (being a veggie) and everyone being better than the last.  Their "Pan con Tomate" is heaven.  I don't know how they do it, but it takes me back to Barcelona, where I went to that tiny famous restaurant where they gave me "Pan con Tomate" and I started being all frou frou and slicing the tomato and the server yelled at me for doing it wrong... He he.
