Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The pintxos were amazing - we didn't get all of them but the favorite was definitely the cabra (soft cheese with honey on crispy bread) and the chorizo wrapped date. I was expecting the chorizo wrapped date to be super sweet, but it was the perfect amount of sweet. The cabra is just so amazing - the cheese is super soft and slightly sweet and savory and I could've probably had a whole plate of it.
