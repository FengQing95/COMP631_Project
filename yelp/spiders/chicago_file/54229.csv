Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been here twice for brunch and once for dinner! This place is great for groups or just a couple on a date. This place is actually quite large, but reservations are recommended. The two times I came here for brunch on weekends I did not have to wait more than 30 minutes. Service is always great and the price is reasonable!
