Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great place for that old style steakhouse dining. I started with the cognac sezerac old fashioned. Delicious, with an absinthe rinse to add a little edge. The bread on the table had that perfect crunchy and flaky Â crust..but don't eat too much, save room for the mains! We shared the buttermilk fried chicken and a wet aged Rib eye. Both expertly cooked , the chicken crisp and juicey and the rib eye melt in your mouth ,succulent, tender, and that wonderful ribeye marbled fatiness. I wouldn't hesitate to eat here again, oh and of course the service was top notch and what you would expect from such a classy joint.
