Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been here on a few occasions, and I am a large fan. The selection and quality of tapas Ba-Ba-Reeba has is great. The ambience of the place is nice as well. With out a doubt make arangements for reservations. This place is VERY popular. Without reservations on a weekend, you will expect to wait 1 hour or more. Now, this is not an insult, but a tribute to how popular and great of a place it is. This is a great date place to bring someone to.
