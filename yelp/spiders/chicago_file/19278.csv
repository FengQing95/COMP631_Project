Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnatis was recommended to us by a lift driver so we decided to check it out. Being it our first time in Chicago, we ordered the classic deep dish pizza. It was yummy but (in MY opinion) extremely cheesy, though those in my group seemed to enjoy that. Our server was also great and attentive. The large pizza was plenty to feed 4, we actually had enough left over to have it for dinner. Overall, this place was good and I would maybe visit again, but I would order something with a little more meat
