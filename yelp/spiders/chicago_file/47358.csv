Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The four of us shared our bite sized desserts because yelp had an amazing offer (one free dessert per guest) and we immensely enjoyed the butterscotch custard cream (great for a a sweet tooth) followed by the vanilla orange flan (SOOOO delicous!) then the banana caramelized banana and lastly the mango sorbet. If I based my rating on the desserts alone I would have given this place 4 stars but based on the more savory tapas...just 2. =/
