Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our waiter was pretty aggressive in getting us to order oyster towers and king crab.  What I lack in income to order a $165 plate of shellfish, our waiter lacked in the "dude, back off already" department.  We did order appetizers though: the baked goat cheese (circa 1992) and the shrimp cocktail.  The goat cheese is one of the most popular appetizers on the menu - it's good for sharing and great if you love the combination of goat cheese, tomato sauce, and garlic toast.  And who doesn't love cheese and carbohydrates?
