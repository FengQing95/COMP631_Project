Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Sexy accents, tapas, sangria and flamenco music is what comes to mind when I think of Spain!! Some people hate the accent, me personally I love it and find it extremely sexy!! As for the tapas I could eat  them almost every night of the week and never get sick of it!!! So  cafe ba ba reba had been one of those bad experiences for me as well and I had completely shut it out of my life. Until I went to Vegas with my brother and we were starving...literally!! We had just landed and had no idea or clue where to go and saw cafe ba ba reba on the strip and decided to go because it was a name that we knew and I guess it was somewhat comforting?!!! Anyhow we had the most amazing experience with the food and our server. He was awesome and the food was pipping hot and delicious!! We wiped  those plates clean like we had not eaten in weeks and since then I'm a HUGE FAN!! I love their goat cheese with tomato sauce, their lamb chops are the bomb and their white sangria on a perfectly beautiful summer day in their patio is heaven!!!
