Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Being a New York/Jersey native, I'm used to that classic style thin crust pizza. If there's one thing that always brings a smile to my face, it's a slice of delicious pizza. So when I heard about deep dish pizza, I kind of cringed at the thought of mountains of bread and cheese on a pizza. Until I came to Lou Malnati's.
