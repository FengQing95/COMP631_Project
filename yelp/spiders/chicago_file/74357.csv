Little Goat Diner////I sat and was greeted by the waitress.  She asked what type of food I'm allergic to or dislike- I say onions.  Everything from there on out was covered in onions.  Fine, I can pick them off.  Doesn't even scratch the surface or give me reason enough for a poor review.  I also asked 'what are the best things on the menu...I want those'.  I typically order that way because I expect the wait staff to know what people like/what's fresh/what looks good coming out of the kitchen.
