Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Awesome food with even better service! We went there the first morning we woke up on my birthday trip to Chicago and it was the perfect way to start off the trip!! We got a table right away, outside. The waiter was so amazingly entertaining, friendly, and knowledgeable. The food had a great presentation and tasted great. Plus, the location is right outside Millennium Park. Highly recommend!
