Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My favorite tapa has to be the spicy potatoes, it's always a must when Im here. The sauce it comes with is soo freaking good. I also get the meatballs which are delicious. One time I decide to get the sangria and the special was mango. They should serious keep it on the menu because I want to order it every time I go.
