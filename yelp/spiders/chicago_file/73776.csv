Little Goat Diner////Shared the macho nachos and the chips were especially amazing. Then tried the Goat Almighty. Can't say I had it, because I only got through a small piece of it. Need to come here hungry. This burger was a tower of meat and stuff. I had to lay it down. Got through the goat burger, which was awesome, and the tortilla with jalapenos at the bottom. My friend took the rest home to her bottomless pit of a husband.
