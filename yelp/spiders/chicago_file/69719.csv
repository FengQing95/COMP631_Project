Little Goat Diner////I will need to come back; we ordered the kimchi wings, I got the Pork Belly Pancake and my buddy got a Tuna melt.  All three items were outstanding.  I ordered a cookie pie to go as we were leaving, mostly because I have no shame, and of all the things we ordered that was the closest to being a disappointment.  That was probably more because I built this magical cookie pie up to epic proportions in my mind after the rest of the meal than because it was at all bad.  You don't come crying to me, anthropomorphic Cookie Pie, you have the Pork Belly Pancake and Kimchi Wings to blame for my poor rating of you.  Take it up with them and leave me out of it.
