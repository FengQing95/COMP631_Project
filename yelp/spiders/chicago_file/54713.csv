Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is my favorite tapas restaurant! Â Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! gets better and better, every time I dine with them. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The service is speedy and the food/drinks are awesome. We made 5pm reservations for Thursday. I completely forgot that they have Happy Hour from 4pm to 6pm. There was half priced sangria, beer, pinxtos and appetizers! We tried the Estrella beer, 2 glasses of Koval Rye, deviled eggs, bacon-wrapped dates, manchego and spinach stuffed mushrooms, tomato bread, fried chicken thighs, citrus salmon and pork shoulder and chicken paella. Each dish was delicious! We will definitely be back to try their brunch.
