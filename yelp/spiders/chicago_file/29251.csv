Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Don't come here when you're really hungry because that hunger will turn into hangriness.  It's deep dish pizza so it'll be about 30 minutes before your meal arrives.  When you arrive it's suggested you order before being seated so that your wait time diminishes a bit.  If you arrive before 6:30 the wait won't be terribly bad.
