Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We definitely ordered more plates than just this... I think our final bill came out around $300 after tax and tip. Not cheap for the 5 of us, but we also ordered a lot of food. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is a great spot for groups who love to try different foods and share bites, but I wouldn't come here if you're looking to keep the spending down.
