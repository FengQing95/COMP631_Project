Smoque BBQ////i had the pleasure of dining here and ordering a few different items from the menu - the staff was courteous and delightful even with all my annoying questions. the sausages was tasty, snappy and smoked to perfection - the ribs had a great rub on them that i didn't even have to bother with any sauce but of course, i had to tast each of the sauces (just in case)
