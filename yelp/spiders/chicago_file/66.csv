Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////If you like mexican chorizo you must try the Los altos Benedict! Its the Perfect blend of crunchy English muffin with creamy chipotle hollandaise sauce, and roasted red peppers smothered in spicy chorizo! And the side of hash browns were just about the best I've EVER had! Â The wildberry juice blend was also quite tasty- thank you to the waitress who suggested it! :)
