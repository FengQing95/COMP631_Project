Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great atmosphere and plenty of areas to sit and wait. Be prepared to wait even with a reservation but it is so worth it. We were cranky after our long wait but service was excellent and swift. The best steak I have ever had in my life!!! Steak tartar is a must even if you have never tried it. Mac and cheese was fantastic. Can't wait to go back.
