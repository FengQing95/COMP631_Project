Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////In town and yelp suggested this place for a deep dish pizza. It was a Friday night around 8, it was a 45min wait. Fine I anticipated that. We sit down the waitress tells us if we want pizza to let her know soon because it takes 45min to cook it. So we ordered that first, with cheese break, and a salad, and lous chicken pasta.
