Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Even during COVID, they are still serving some of the best deep dish in the city and taking good precautions as far as the pandemic goes. Took my significant other here for the first time and it's just as amazing as I remember it. Would definitely recommend any of their locations in Chicago for a great, true deep dish experience.
