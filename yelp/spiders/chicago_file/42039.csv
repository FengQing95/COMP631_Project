Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went here with a friend and loved every minute of it! We did not have a reservation and were told there was a 1.5 hour wait but we could go to the bar which was first come first serve. Withing a couple of minutes of waiting we snagged a table in the bar area that also falls into the "first come first serve" area . All of the tapas we had were delicious and went great with the bottle of wine the server recommended. They had a Yelp deal going on that allowed a free dessert with a check-in so we got the Churros, which were nothing special, if I go again I would opt for a different dessert.
