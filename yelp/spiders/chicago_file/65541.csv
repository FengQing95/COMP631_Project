Smoque BBQ////Was going to be in the area Sunday evening and so I finally stopped by for the first time. It was 8pm, we found parking right in front (the street across is residential only though), the place was busy but boo and I were next in line, so very little wait...great start. They were closing in an hour at 9, so the fact that the place was still so lively was very impressive. Other reviews make it out to seem that the place is tiny with virtually no seating, but they actually do have a decent amount, especially with the outdoor tables. However, since this place is always at capacity, I can see the criticism.
