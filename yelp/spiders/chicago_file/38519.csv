Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Absolutely wonderful! My date and I arrived early for our 9:30 reservation. We were shown to the bar, where there was only 1 tight seat. The host noticed that my date wasn't happy, and immediately had plan B at a side counter.  We were seated on time. The place is a bit noisy, but still had great ambiance. My date had filet mignon and I had NY Strip, both were perfect. We ordered baked Brie for an app which I wish had been more traditional. It tasted like ricotta and not brie,  like lasagna filling with tomato sauce in top. We also had spinach, which was creamed with  gorgonzola instead of butter. I would have liked a simpler, "cleaner" vegetable, but it was still very good. All in all it was a lovely celebration dinner! I'd return.
