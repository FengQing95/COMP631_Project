Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Besides the pizzas we got the Malnati salad which was very good and an order of bruschetta for an app. The bruschetta ok. Nothing too fancy to talk about. The service here was also top notch. Our server was extremely friendly and attentive. She got everything to us quickly and check up on us often to make sure everything was to our likings.
