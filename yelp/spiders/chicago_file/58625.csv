Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I ate too much here.  It's a tapas restaurant, so a friend pretty much ordered half the menu items on the menu for all of us to sample.  We ordered a pitcher of the sangria, so if you like sangria, order it!  We ordered beef empanadas, bacon wrapped dates(my favorite), deviled egg, goat cheese in tomato sauce, and chicken empanada.  My top favorites were the bacon wrapped dates, beef empanadas and deviled egg.  They were just enough to sample, and the sangria was pretty tasty. I will have to try to paella next time I'm in town, it looked fantastic at the table next to us.  No pictures because my phone had died.
