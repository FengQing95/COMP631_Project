Art Institute of Chicago////Three employees shined... The sweet young man who gave out audio tours and the two women at the jewelry counter in the museum shoppe!  The petite older woman was light hearted and kind! Are all tall young ladies from Buffalo NY as clever and delightful as the one who rang up our goodies?  I loved how when the older woman went off of her shift the tall younger gal made a point to say goodbye to her quite kindly.  Very sweet!
