Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I ordered the two scrambled eggs, bacon, hash brown, pancake-plate. Each of those items were the best I have ever had. The bacon was thick cut and extremely flavorful (note that there is no such thing as bad bacon, it's only good, great, or above). I'm from out of town and this was my first visit to Chicago. If I'm ever back, Wildberry will sure be on my itinerary.
