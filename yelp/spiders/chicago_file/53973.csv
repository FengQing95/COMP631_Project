Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Who doesn't love tapas? As maid-of-honor I wanted to plan a fun night and was looking for a pre-fix to anticipate costs. They have many levels of pre-fixes and I chose the cheapest one because by the time you add in the taxes and fees and gratuity. It ends up being about $50/pp. But then no one is fighting over the bill. It's all fair and equal. And with an added touch they make a personalized menu which is a nice touch. Since we didn't end up making any hard and fast plans for dinner it ended up being a 3 hour dinner. Lots of great food. Just a word to the wise, if you have a large party you need to start the planning at least two months in advance to get a desirable time.
