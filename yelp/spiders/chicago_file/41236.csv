Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////our waiter johnny made the entire experience.  he was delightfully charming, fun, and had fantastic food/sangria recommendations.  and it didnt appear to bother him at all that we were probably totally annoying (we ordered our food in several separate rounds, and switched halfway from an outside table to indoors).  johnny elevated what would have been a nice dinner on its own into a fabulous dining experience.
