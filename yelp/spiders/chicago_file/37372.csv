Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food: I love the short rib strogonoff, in fact I love it so much that I always get the same thing! I also love the crab cake appetizer and oysters, can't go wrong with them.  Their bread is amazing and their filet is so melt in your mouth tender. There isn't anything I've had or tasted that has not been delicious.  The service is always perfect too, from the friendly front door hostess/hosts to the servers, it's just perfect!
