Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The fact that you can place your order while you are waiting for table is ingenious. We went on a whim based on fellow yelp reviews. The place was crowded when we got there, and by the looks of it, it always is! We had the melnetis original butter crust pizza. It was definitely good, but unfortunately, not life changing. Based on reviews, I guess I was expecting much, much more.
