Art Institute of Chicago////Good art, bad service. Was stopped because my bag was "too big" by the check in guy, but then while I was waiting to speak to a supervisor I watched the same check in guy let in five other people with bags just as big as, or bigger than mine. When they finally let me in, I was later followed by a different security guard through a sculpture exhibit. Don't come here if you don't want to be profiled based on your appearance. My family and I won't be coming back.
