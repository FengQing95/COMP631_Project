Smoque BBQ////The atmosphere is casual, busy, and loud (but not so insanely loud you can't hear the person next to you). Since it is casual and loud I would definitely consider it "kid friendly" and they have some smaller options available for kids. If you can go without a stroller I would recommend doing so since it can get kind of tight.
