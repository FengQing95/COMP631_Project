Smoque BBQ////I like to consider myself as a BBQ snob being I'm from Missouri which is very near to some of the best BBQ. I always judge places based on their brisket bc you either do it well and it's not worth eating...... Well let me tell you the brisket was not a disappointment.... I loved every bit of it from the burnt ends to the perfectly smoked taste. The cornbread was pretty decent but the coleslaw was not, in my opinion good at all. If you're going through Chicago and want BBQ go here!!
