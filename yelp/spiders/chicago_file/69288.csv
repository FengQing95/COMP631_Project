Little Goat Diner////Food:  Goat chili was excellent.  As was mac and cheese.  Note that even though the mac and cheese is a "side," it is a huge portion.  Similarly, the sandwiches are HUGE.  Definitely had to take half home.  Like other reviewers, the goat sloppy joe was awesome.  The bbq pulled pork sammie was also fantastic.  The flavors were perfect.  And I normally am not a fan of pulled pork or shredded meat in general.  My only gripe is the size of the bun.  It might it a lot hard to eat because the bun was really really big.  Seriously worried my jaw was going to lock by trying to open it that wide.  Life is hard.
