Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////You wake up, you think it is a dream, because in front of you is a platter of pipe cut bone marrow roasted to perfection dripping with that marrow goodness and fresh toasted points with caramelized red onion jam and parsley salad.  All hilter kilter arranged on a plate as if it were for  Fred Flintstone. Then you become Fred.  You are in heaven.
