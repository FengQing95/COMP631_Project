Art Institute of Chicago////MAN I love this place! The art is beautifully displayed and I love the new rules they implemented recently that allow everyone to take pictures of everything (just avoid flash). The gift shop has great finds for both yourself and friends, and admission is very affordable (and some days it is even free!). It's a great place to come with friends, a date, or just alone to soak up some good old artsy goodness. I'll definetly be back again and again!
