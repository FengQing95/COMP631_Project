Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////wow how do people like this pizza the sausage is horrible and the crust taste like stale bread... I have lived in the chicago area for a little over 2 years now and this pizza is a disgrace to the chicago style name...wake up people try a real pizza giordano's is way better... dominos pizza blows this place out of the water and its not even good... dont waste your money!
