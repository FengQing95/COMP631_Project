Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my first time trying the deep dish pizza at this establishment, I went on a recommendation of a family member.  The staff are great and very attentive to any needs.  The dining room gets a bit crowded, the distance between tables is a bit short which made it a bit of a maze to get to the restroom.
