Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////A lot of people told me to try Giordano's, but my gut instinct told me to go with Lou Malnati's because several of my native Chicago friends highly recommended it. Still, in an effort to appease my bf, I decided to try out Giordano's, which was good...but extremely loaded with toppings and crazy thick crust - to the point where I was in a daze for four hours afterward. Lou Malnati's is completely different and WAY better! Their famous butter crust is just right! I was a bit wary of it because I don't tend to like overly buttered food, but the crust wasn't abnormally thick and had a nice crisp, while still staying true to the proverbial Chicago deep dish concept. I especially love their deliciously fresh marinara sauce because it has tons of real tomato chunks in it, which makes the pizza extra juicy! We also tried their buffalo wings, which were great too! We LOVED this place! In fact, we're even thinking about ordering their pizza online and getting it shipped!!!
