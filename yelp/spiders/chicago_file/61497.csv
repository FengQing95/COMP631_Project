Smoque BBQ////I moved to the neighborhood three years ago and I've lost count of the number of times I've been here.  Sometimes the line is absurd, sometimes the meat can be a bit dry, and some of the side dishes are forgettable, but I love this place too much for anything less than five stars.  My favorite is the sliced brisket sandwich with sides of fries and coleslaw.  Their fries are secretly awesome, plus the coleslaw is pretty darn good.  My girlfriend swears by the babyback ribs and usually picks them clean.
