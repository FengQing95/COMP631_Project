Smoque BBQ////First this place really needs to move into bigger digs. We came at 2 on a saturday, and the place was packed. You have to squeeze by people to sit down, go to the bathroom, pick up the food, pick up the utensils you forgot, get water, really anything. Â There was a sign that said max occupancy was 45 people, and there were definitely more people than that.
