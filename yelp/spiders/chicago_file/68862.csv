Little Goat Diner////The apple cider cake and blueberry orange fennel scone I purchased the other morning were wonderful! I think I may like Little Goat Bread more than Little Goat Diner. Next time I'll have to pick up some bread in addition to pastries. The peanut butter bread with raisins sounds unique. Â Highly recommend.
