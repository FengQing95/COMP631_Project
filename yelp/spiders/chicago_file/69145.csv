Little Goat Diner////I unfortunately didn't go for my gut feeling and should have just got the hell outta there at this point, but I am an optimist, really wanted to try some dessert.  The pecan-pie cookie item with a side of ice cream was really ho-hum.  I expected the dessert to be heated up at least, but it was just a so-so baked cookie with a scoop of ice cream.  I believe it was $8?
