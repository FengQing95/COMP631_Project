Smoque BBQ////The menu is displayed on huge chalkboards along with the prices to give a old lunch pal kind of mojo for customers and I like it. I ordered the brisket platter with a side of mac and cheese and french fries, it comes with a side of cole slaw as well. The portions are HUGE here and worth every penny. The brisket was the best I have ever had (this is my first time trying brisket though), the mac and cheese was awesome and the fries as well. I was surprised by the cole slaw because most food places just drop a cup full of mayo and call it a day but not Smoque. You can taste the freshness of the veg they used for it as well as the vinegar. The waiters/hostess/tray pickerupers were amazing as well.
