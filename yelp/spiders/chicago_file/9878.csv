Art Institute of Chicago////This is a very nice, spacious, and incredibly quiet museum. I came for the Degas exhibit and was pleased to see not only paintings, but also sculptures from the artist. There are so many different areas to explore in this museum, including beautiful Monets, so I'm glad I brought flats. I should have done more Ferris Bueller impersonations while viewing some of the most famous artwork in the world. Unfortunately, the 1st floor photography section was closed during our visit - not sure why. If you get there an hour before closing, ticket prices drop to $15, but that's probably not enough time to enjoy!
