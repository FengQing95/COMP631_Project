Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We were recommend the bone in age filet mignon and bone in aged rib eye steaks by a wonderful waiter. Both were one of the best steaks we have ever had. The decor was energetic but romantic as well. The mushroom side was out of this world, we get the hype, this place rocks. This is a must experience place for any Chicago traveler.
