Little Goat Diner////Today we went to this restaurant for breakfast. We signed up 1 hour ahead of time. It was loud and noisy and it took one hour more before they took our order.  Service was unacceptably slow.They ran out of bagels by 11:30 AM. Everything was ala carte and for eggs, bacon, coffee, a few bagels and one salad for 4 of us it was $80. When we complained they were attentive but not a dime off the bill. Three out of four of us got diarrhea.  Emperors new clothes restaurant, need I say more?
