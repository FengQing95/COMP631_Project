Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visiting Chicago I of course wanted to have some thick crust pizza.  However, also being gluten free I was worried I wouldn't find any and/or it wouldn't taste good.  A friend recommended Lou Malnati's and it was delicious.  The cheese pie hit the spot and no reactions after so I'm super thankful for their gluten free options.
