Smoque BBQ////I am officially obsessed with this place. It's crowded on weekends, but not on weekdays! Weekday afternoons are definitely the best time to go if you want no lines and no waiting. I also must say that the lines during the busy times look long, but the wait time is never really that bad (and the food is DEFINITELY worth the wait!). Helpful hosts/bussers clear you a table while you wait in line to order, and once you've placed your order you'll have a place to sit (usually, depending on how busy it is).
