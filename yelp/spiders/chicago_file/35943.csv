Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Best filet I've ever had...with the best wine policy for a steak house. You can bring a bottle of your own wine, with no corkage fee...the only thing you have to do is give a glass of your wine to someone random in the restaurant. I just love that! Having our own bottle of wine saved us so much money on our final bill.
