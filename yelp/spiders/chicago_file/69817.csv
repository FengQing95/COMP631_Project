Little Goat Diner////  I figured I'd give it another chance since it's so fancy in there and looks like a good menu if overpriced. Took my girlfriend there for a late breakfast and we waited 1:30 hrs since they forgot about us and we had to go back and ask 3 times, and it's hard to hear its so loud in there. they really wanted to sit us at the "communal" cattle tables after forgetting about us anyway.  They kept apologizing for everything, great; just stop screwing up.
