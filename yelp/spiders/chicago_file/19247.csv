Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Coming from the East Coast I've never been a huge fan of deep-dish, but I had to have some while I was in Chicago.  I was aware these pizzas take a while to cook, but Lou's was definitely worth the wait.  On ordering, I chose "butter crust" over "dough crust" (I wasn't really sure what the difference would be and just rationalized that butter might taste better), and I was not disappointed.  Some of the pizza photos of other local favorites just struck me as gooey incoherent messes of cheese, but this pizza was well balanced in all elements, so I can see how it could appeal to a wide base when there are so many tough critics out there with different tastes.
