Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I came on a Tuesday with some friends, so getting in wasn't an issue. We split a pitcher of sangria which was amazing. I easily could've drank an entire pitcher by myself (one woman did. She was throwing up in the bathroom. Happens to the best of us). I would recommend the berry.
