Little Goat Diner////These were good, but probably our least favorite from everything we ordered and we'll opt to try something new next time. The tortillas were very crispy, the fish was lightly fried, and the flavors complimented each other well. We had three tostadas filled with crisp whitefish, shallot aioli, pickled jalape√±o peppers, and a chickpea and onion salad.
