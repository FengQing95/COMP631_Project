Smoque BBQ////I had the brisket and was of the opinion that it was good, not great.  It hardly rates up against the Texas BBQ that apparently attempts to emulate, such as Cooper's in Llano, Country Tavern in Kilgore or Salt Lick outside of Austin.  All three beat the socks off this place.  That being said, Smoque is serviceably good.  I'd go back, but it's not going to envoke the mouthwatering daydreams that any of the above mentioned places might.
