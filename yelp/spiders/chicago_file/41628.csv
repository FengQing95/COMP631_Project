Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This tapas place is amazing ... I have been going there for the past 6 years and its amazing ... food is great, price is VERY reasonable, my husband LOVES their sangria! Â Service is for the most part good, a few times slow when too crowded and its hard to get a table on the weekends BUT the amazing food makes the wait worth it.
