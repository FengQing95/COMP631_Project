The Purple Pig//// Standout factor: come here for amazing food AND wines! This spot has been one of my top 3 restaurants in Chicago for as long as Ive been dining in Chi, a major reason being everything I've ordered has been a delicious and solid choice, nothing disappoints EVER! I find myself wanting to come back again and again to try the entire menu AND re-order the same food, which is very rare for me! The chef adds such a unique twist to his dishes that you just can't find Â anywhere else !
