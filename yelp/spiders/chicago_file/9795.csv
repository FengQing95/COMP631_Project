Art Institute of Chicago////With the announcement of the World's Colombian Exposition to be held in 1892-93, the Art Institute pressed for a building on the lakefront to be constructed for the fair, but to be used by the Institute afterwards. The city agreed, and the Art Institute has graced our fair city since then.
