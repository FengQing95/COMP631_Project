Little Goat Diner////Not quite as good as Girl and the Goat but still pretty decent for next level diner food. My wife was really looking forward to the sloppy goat but we were a little disappointed. The best dish was the brussels sprouts which were absolutely phenomenal and have been duplicated in our home several times now.
