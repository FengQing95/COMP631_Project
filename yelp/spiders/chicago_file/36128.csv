Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We ordered the baked goat cheese with marinara, which came with buttered toast that was delicious. The roast chicken was moist and juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside, almost as crispy as the skin on a Peking duck on, which requires real skill! I had the short rib stroganoff, which had an amazing cream sauce, and the short rib basically melted in my mouth, it was so tender! I ordered a side of the Elote corn, of which I wasn't expecting the sour taste. It was interesting, but I would pass on it the next time around.
