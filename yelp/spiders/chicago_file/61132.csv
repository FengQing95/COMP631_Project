Smoque BBQ////Been here twice now and I wouldn't change a thing. Had the sliced brisket last week and baby back ribs the other day. Both were very tender and juicy and cooked perfectly.  I've tried the mac not cheese, brisket chili, Cole slaw and corn bread sides and also the peach cobbler.  All were very tasty and I wouldn't change a thing. I love that they have multiple sauces for different tastes.  I prefer the Carolina style but both are very good. I'm looking forward to trying something different next time.
