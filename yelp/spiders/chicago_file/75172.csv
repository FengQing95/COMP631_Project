Little Goat Diner////If you're trying to be the touristy Chicago visitor, you have to stop by Little Goat and try their nachos. Hands down, best in the city. As a heads up, if you're eating it alone, you won't finish them. Also try the bullseye French toast. I personally wasn't a big fan of it, but the rest of my table thought it was fantastic.
