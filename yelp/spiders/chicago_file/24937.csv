Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////i visited here this past weekend with some friends, my first time in Chicago ever! it was a PACKED st. Patty's day Saturday and boy was the wait pretty long. Nonetheless, we got a table an hour later after being given a wait time and preordering pizza. The bummer was, I'd forgotten to add on pepperoni to the "Lou" pizzas I ordered!
