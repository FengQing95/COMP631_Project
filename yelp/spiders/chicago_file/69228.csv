Little Goat Diner////Rude service . I over heard the hostess tell another to seat someone ahead of me because they were tourists and in a hurry . When I confronted the hostess she just looked at me and said nothing. Then the waitress gave us attitude . Would have expected more from a place owned by a celebrity chef . Won't go back . Not worth the wait .
