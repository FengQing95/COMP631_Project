Little Goat Diner////The roof top bar is very nice.  But eating in the main dining area, the music is blaring and can barely hear others at the table to have a nice conversation, you almost need to yell.  The for two of our ordered menu items, the Boo Boo Baise and the Fried Chicken, we were told they ran out of mashed potatoes!  How does a class diner/restaurant run out of a staple like mashed potatoes???  Talk about poor planning!  Is there not a grocery store close that they can run out and pick up some potatoes to cook and mash????   They did ask about substituting rice or grits---but fried chicken calls for mashed potatoes!  Turn down the music, Stephanie!  People do like to have a nice conversation when going out to eat.  Most diners do NOT have music blaring!  And have your chefs do better planning!
