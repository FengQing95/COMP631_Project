Little Goat Diner////Hip place with a huge flavorful menu of comfort food. Everything looked so good I didn't know what to order. We had a nice quiet afternoon lunch here. I ordered the Tonkatsu (a breaded pork cutlet with Asian BBQ sauce and cabbage on bread - yum). I was surprised how big my sandwich was. The service was great and I enjoyed the spacious restaurant with its open kitchen and the attached bakery. They even have dining on their rooftop that is also used for parties (and yoga too!). I'm hoping to try the corned beef hash next time I'm in.
