Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I walked in here around noon with my mom on a icy Sunday. The place only had a few scattered patrons, so I really got to see how huge it is. It has a home-y, warm feel and it smells like yummy sizzling meats. Mmmm. The service is best described as spotty-- I always had my water filled to the brim and dishes came and went very promptly, but we had some difficulty getting the attention of our actual waiter.
