The Purple Pig////WOW! Just WOW! This place is amazing! My gf and I went around 9:30 and it was still packed, but we were able to scope out a couple seats at the bar. Bar seating is always where it's at! The gentleman who served us was VERY knowledgeable about the place and had great recommendations. The customer service was excellent! The food was absolutely delicious! Would definitely come here again or they can just come to NYC!
