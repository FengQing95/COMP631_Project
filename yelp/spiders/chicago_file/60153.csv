Smoque BBQ////It's been a while since I've written, I may be a bit rusty, but here we go.  Last night husband and I tried Smoque.  We'd heard so much raving about it, that we were dying to try it.  True to what we'd been told there was a line from hell.  However I had called ahead at noon to order dinner at 7.  Once we got into the door enough for me to see an employee I asked where to go's orders get their goods.  He pointed me straight to the front and I was relieved.  The place smells of, well...smoke.  What did I expect.
