Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ordered a TON of vegetarian friendly options: season market vegetable hash, goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, spicy potatoes with tomato alioli, My friends ordered some of the meat options and loved them. We ended up ordering another goat cheese platter because it was that good.
