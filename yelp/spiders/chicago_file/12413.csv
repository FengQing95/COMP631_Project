Art Institute of Chicago////This place was HUGE! I was very impressed with the layout of the building because there was plenty of space to accommodate the large amount of people visiting the museum (without feeling too crowded). This weekend happened to be "Bank of America" weekend so anyone who had a card with them, got in for free. This saved us $94 total for our group! There is a wide variety of art available for viewing so if you go with a group, there's probably something for everyone. The only thing I wish they did different was set it up so you were kind of guided through the museum on a path (like an IKEA) so you made sure you saw everything the museum had to offer instead of free roaming, making it more difficult to see every single exhibit/showroom. Plan on spending an hour or two here.
