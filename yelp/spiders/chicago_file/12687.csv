Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Good Chicago Pie.  Recommend the "Lou", as well as the stuffed spinach bread.  Unfortunately, the hostess was extremely rude which ruined the luncheon experience for my visiting family.  Went inside to ask to be seated outside...when the hostess and I stepped outside, my family had already taken a table (which the outside server had told them they could be seated).  The first thing that came out of the hostess' mouth to my parents was "Don't do this again because I could have had other people waiting for this table".  No "Hi, Hello, Welcome". This was said in front of all the other patrons who stopped and looked at my family.  Very embarassing to feel like we were being reprimanded like children. I thought a hostess was to help create a welcome environment but not in this case; however our server more than made up for her rudeness.  Attempted to give her feedback before we left, but her response was "I'm sorry but I have a job to do"...She clearly didn't get it.  Unfortunately we live around the corner and may just have to go to Ginos or do take out...
