Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I wish I could remember our waiter's name because he was absolutely the best server I've had in years. His timing at our table was impeccable--neither too frequent or too late. He always arrived in time for our next order or question. He knew the menu well and gave us several good suggestions and was friendly without being overly familiar. He really helped make the dinner feel like a celebration.
