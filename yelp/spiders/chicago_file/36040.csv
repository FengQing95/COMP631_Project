Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////1) Our reservation was for 8:15PM. We arrived at 8PM and were told our table wasn't ready so we went to the bar to order a drink. We were finally seated at 8:45PM, 30 minutes after our reservation time. Not super happy about it, but the restaurant apologized for the delay and gave us 2 glasses of prosecco on the house.
