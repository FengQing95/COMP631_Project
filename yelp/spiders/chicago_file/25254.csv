Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The taste depends on where you go! Sadly the quality control for consistency amongst the restaurants is lacking. The State/Rush street place is not the best. Wells Street by Merchandise Mart tends to be solid. If you think Pizanos taste similar... it because it does! They are step brothers.
