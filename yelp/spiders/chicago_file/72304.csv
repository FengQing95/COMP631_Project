Little Goat Diner////I'm a big fan of Stephanie Izard, but I was so disappointed in my meal! I got the pork belly pancake, which was not great. It's a pretty tiny dish....the scallion pancake was really tough, and difficult to cut (seemed to be over-cooked). The pork was a little too sweet for my taste, and was also very tough. It tasted like it was something that had been left sitting under a heat lamp too long. Table mates mostly got salads, and they didn't seem to think they were anything spectacular.
