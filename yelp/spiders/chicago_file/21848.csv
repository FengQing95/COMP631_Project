Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered pepperoni with bunch of veggies as toppings, but when our pizza came to our table, it only had pepperoni and olives as toppings. We informed the waiter and he first asked if we wanted to wait for our correct order, which will take another 30min. We already had waited over 30min to be seated, so we said we would rather not and we just ate the pizza with just pepperoni and olives. We usually like our pizzas with lots of toppings, so we didn't enjoy it as much, but it was good! Later on, the manager came to our table and apologized for the mistake. He gave us a 50% discount. Although we were a bit disappointed about the wrong order, we were satisfied by the service.
