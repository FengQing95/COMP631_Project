Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Was in the Armitage neighborhood looking for brunch place. Nookies 2 was packed so decided to try here. Decent not great but nice atmosphere for brunch. Less crowded than dinner here. The spinach and artichoke crepe was good but disappointed in the cinnamon French toast. Too hard and glazed on the outside for my taste.
