Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When the pizza finally came out it was lukewarm. We ate a slice each while discussing if we just plough through eating room temp pizza or whether we send it back to be warmed up. We asked our server to have it warmed up in the oven. It came back 10 mins later lukewarm again. Arg!! We asked our server whether deep dish was usually served at room temp and she apologised and replied that no, it should be piping hot. She bagged the remaining pizza for us and told us we would not have to pay since our meal had been so disappointing. Such a shame. Oh well, back to flat Neapolitan style pizzas I guess. Wood fired and always great.
