Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was disappointed with both. This pizza reminded me of pizza I had in grade school. It was just purely boring. I cannot fathom the hype. I came to the conclusion that I am a fan of Chicago style pizza but not Chicago Pizza. The waitress was friendly, sociable and politically aware.
