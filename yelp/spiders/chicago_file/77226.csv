Little Goat Diner////This is my 7 year old son's favorite restaurant! The staff is always friendly and attentive. The food is awesome although it may feel like a limited menu the flavors are bold and yummy! We especially love the sourdough pancakes - a personal favorite. They treat my son lovely, which is greatly appreciated. The space is beautiful and light and airy.
