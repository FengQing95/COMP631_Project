Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I can't get enough of this place. I love the quince and cheese and that's so filling but so hard to stop eating. Same with the spicy potatoes.The braised lamb really stands out and the sirloins here are always cooked perfectly. The beet and orange salad isn't the best beet salad around but it's great just to have a tiny bite of salad between all the other dishes. The roasted dates are also on my list of favorites. There are so many things to like on the menu and it's such a laid back place. A really good place to bring out of town friends or parents. I haven't tried the stuffed mushrooms yet but believe me, I will.
