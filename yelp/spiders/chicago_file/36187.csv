Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////He had to wait a few minutes for our table but a waiter quickly took our drink order. Everything was wonderful and would highly recommend coming here. Things I suggest ordering: raw oysters, shrimp cocktail crab cake (95% crab), and petite filet as we went heavy on the starters. They also have a wine list if you do not want to partake in their BYOB allowance.
