Little Goat Diner////I love this place! You should always make a reservation because they are always busy and you will have to wait more than 30 minutes without a reservation. I have been here for both lunch and dinner. This last time I went I made a reservation and was unfortunately 15 minutes late due to parking issues (they have valet parking for $12 but I didn't want to pay that much so I searched around and finally found a spot for $4 for 2 hours on the street). They won't seat you until your entire party is there even with a reservation. Unfortunately the person I was meeting was also late and the hostess had to give away our table. Luckily for us there was another one available right after so we did not have to wait. My friend and I both ordered hot tea. It took a while to come out and when it did the tea bags had already been sitting in the tea cups for quite a while and the tea was severely over-steeped (i.e. it tasted bitter and was not good). My friend had to send her water glass back because there was a lip stain on it and she hadn't even drank out of it yet...so as far as drinks go Little Goat did not do well. I ordered the cinnamon roll...fabulous as always (and took half of it home for later). I also ordered a spanish omelette which was delicious. It had pickled peppers, cheese, sour cream, and some sort of salsa which was fabulous! I would definitely recommend it for vegetarians or omelette lovers!
