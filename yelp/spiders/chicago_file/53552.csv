Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-ba-reeba is a crowd pleaser hot spot, great for large groups! The Spanish tapas and flavorful sangrias made for a perfect girls night out/birthday dinner. We did have some issues with reservations and having to wait for a table to clear out for our party of 10 on a Thursday night, but the staff was apologetic and gave us a free bottle of sangria.
