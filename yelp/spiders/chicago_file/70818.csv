Little Goat Diner////I was really looking forward to trying this place out, because I had heard so many great things about Stephanie Izard's restaurants. Girl & the goat is almost impossible to get a reservation at, so I decided to come here instead! Overall, the food was very unique, I just didn't completely love what I ordered (Little piggy goes to china). The waiter even warned me about the dish as he said people either love it or hate it. My friend on the other hand ordered the french toast & LOVED it. So maybe I just had a meh experience and should've listened to the waiter's warning. Overall, super cute restaurant and good food!
