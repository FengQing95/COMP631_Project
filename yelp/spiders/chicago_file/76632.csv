Little Goat Diner////The Sourdough pancakes here are out of this world. Good, strong coffee, excellent service. In fact, it was so good that when my mom asked a question about the napkins, our waitress went back to find the exact brand that they use. Small, but great thing. I love coming to all of Stephanie's spots, but Little Goat = breakfast, me = love breakfast.
