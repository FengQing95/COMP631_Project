Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////When we visited Chicago from Kentucky, I just KNEW I had to eat at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!  It's located in a really cute neighborhood and the restaurant itself is a lot of fun.  We tried a variety of things:  cheeses, deviled eggs, olives, hams, roasted dates, crusty breads, SANGRIA, and other deliciousness.  My favorite was the coconut flan (OMG, can I PLEASE have this recipe?) and the sangria!  I took off one star because I think it's really expensive to make a full meal here, but I would come for a snack and drinks the next time we find ourselves in Chicago.
