Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This pizza was sooo good! We tried Giordanos the night before and Lou's is so much better. We did have a problem where out pizza was not ready on time even though we preordered. We had tickets to something and did not want to be late. The manager came and apologized and gave us a discount off our bill. The sauce made the pizza it had so much flavor. Love it!
