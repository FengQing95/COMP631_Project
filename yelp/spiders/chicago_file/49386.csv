Smoque BBQ////followed Guy fieri and he is right! This place is awesome. We tried almost everything... The baby backs were perfectly done, tender meat, great sauce. I worried that ithe sauce might be to tangy but it was not... Perfect..... Pulll pork - yum... You can't really go wrong with pull pork. Texas sausage = delicious especially for all the sausage lovers! And the briskets... I didn't even know I like briskets. The sides of salads, cornbread, etc was a good way to balance out the meat...
