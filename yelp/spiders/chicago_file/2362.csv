The Purple Pig////Secondly, I ordered a glass of sparkling wine with my lunch and the waitress asked to see my ID but didn't do so for the other person in my party. I think it goes w/o saying that if you card one person in the party, you need to card the whole party. But on top of that, as I was reaching for my ID, she surmised, "HMM YOU MUST BE A '94.... OH YOU'RE A '95, THE 21 CLUB!" (again, caps to exemplify loud tone).. Like, thank you for announcing my age to the restaurant.
