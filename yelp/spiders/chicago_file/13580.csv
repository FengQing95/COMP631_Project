Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered a small (rather than personal size) with the optimistic hope that I would love it and want leftovers. With my first bite, I was surprised to find that the sausage is not dripping with grease, and actually has a distant resemblance to the consistency of a chewy crust. This is not what sausage is supposed to do. After a few more exploratory bites, I decided it was not a bad substitute -- the lack of oil/fat in the sausage is good because really fatty sausage in that quantity could do a person in. But without the flaky pizza crust to support it, the sauce and the whole pizza tasted bland. I had two slices, then called it a day. The leftovers didn't go home with me.
