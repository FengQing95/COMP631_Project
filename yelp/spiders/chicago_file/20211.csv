Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Caveat: this is from the perspective of a tourist. If you don't call ahead, be prepared to wait about 30-40 minutes for your pizza, but it's well worth the wait. I had a house salad which was fine, but nothing special, but the sausage deep-dish pizza was amazing! Decent prices, and the service was good.
