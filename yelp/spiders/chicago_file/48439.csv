Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Selection alone makes this worth a try, of the 6 pintxos and 5 dinner tapas and 5 dessert tapas, I can honestly say I enjoyed them all. My favorite was probably the short rib. We ordered all of the above for two people and it was really too much. They suggest 2-3 per person and I agree. Be prepared for a leisurely meal, I liked that they didn't bring all the tapas at one time, but it did make the dining experience long. I thought the staff was great, really quick to clear plates making room for more. Had a good cocktail selection and a reasonable beer list. Would like to come back next time I'm in town.
