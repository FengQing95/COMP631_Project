Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Very good pizza! You have to wait a good 45 minutes because the pizza is thick and made to order. Totally worth the wait. We got the 3 cheese garlic bread... Delish!!! 2 of us went and got a small we were only able to eat 1 slice each. I could of had the other but didn't want to be in a food coma. Mad I didn't get to try the dessert like I wanted. We're here for a few days definitely going to try to make it back. Plus the wings look bombbb!!!!
