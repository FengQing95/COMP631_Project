Smoque BBQ////It was good BBQ if you live close-by.  But for a 20-30 minute drive plus a 45 minute wait I didn't feel like it was worth it.  Its really crowded so you feel like you are in your neighbors conversation - I accidentally bumped into neighbors on both sides when I got up to leave.  I prefer Blackwood BBQ in the loop.  Food is much tastier, more conveniently located.  Obviously it doesn't have the same dine-in experience but the food is better to me.  But each to his own!
