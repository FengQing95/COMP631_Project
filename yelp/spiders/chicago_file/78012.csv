Little Goat Diner////This place had gotten so much hype, that I HAD to try it. Most of the time, when people hype up a place, I leave a little disappointed...but not Little Goat! This place was outstanding! On a Friday afternoon, this place was PACKED. 1.5 hour wait list and all. Thankfully my husband, myself, and mom were able to scoop a few bar seats and eat there.
