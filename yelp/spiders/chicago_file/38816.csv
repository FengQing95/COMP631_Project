Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Just a top-notch dining experience. It's everything you'd expect a high-end steakhouse experience in Chicago to be. The food and service was outstanding. They've made traditional foods like mashed potatoes and Brussel sprouts something special. Make a reservation. The place is hopping!
