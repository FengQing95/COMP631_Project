Art Institute of Chicago////I paid $5 extra to go into the Van Gogh exhibit they had on display. This line took a lot longer, likely around 30-40 minutes. They were controlling the amount of people let in at once to enhance the experience. However, even with this wait time, when I got inside there were droves of people, still making it hard to appreciate the work or timeline of Van Gogh's wife, as someone was always walking in front of you or immediately by your side.
