Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////came here because that's what people do when they're in Chicago. I should start out by saying I don't love deep dish pizza. But I love pizza in general so I figured it be fun. Our waiter wasn't very friendly and she messed up our orders twice, but when we finally got our pizzas they were fine (I didn't like the sauce flavor)8. If you love the dish you'll probably love this, I'm just glad I went so now I can say I did.
