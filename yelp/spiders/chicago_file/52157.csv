Smoque BBQ////This is deliciousness!! The BBQ options on the menu are perfection, but some of the side dishes are just as noteworthy!! I'll be honest, I've never cared for peaches or anything peach-esque. As a matter a fact, if you hand me a peach, I would probably throw it a you. However, I LOVE their peach cobbler. It's so incredibly delicious and the perfect way to end your meal there. Food is always served fresh and prompt. Seating can be difficult as the dining room isn't large and there is always a line out the door on most evening to place your order. But the wait is worth it on every level.
