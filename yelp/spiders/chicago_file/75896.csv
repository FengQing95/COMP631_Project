Little Goat Diner////I've been to the little goat many times before but this time it was pretty different I was with a friend his wife and newly 1 year old; I specifically requested a high chair as the place was completely empty with over a dozen open booths and the absolutely inconsiderate hostess wouldn't allow us to be seated at a booth with a high chair even though they were available was told that all the booths were reserved! Out of every restaurant both domestically and internationally I've never heard of a specific booth/ table being reserved at a diner! Don't think I'll ever be returning! Oh yes not to mention there were at minimum two other families with booths and older kids at booths in high chairs!!!
