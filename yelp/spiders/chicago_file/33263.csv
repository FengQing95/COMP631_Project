Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////LOVE this place. The food, drinks, atmosphere and service were all amazing. We had the goat cheese appetizer, salmon for entree and the Lillet Rose' martini (delish). No room for dessert but I have heard that the chocolate pie is awesome as well. It's dimly lit and a great date spot. My only complaint is that it's difficult o get a decent reservation time but I guess that's how it works when a place is as good s Bavette's.
