Smoque BBQ////This is by far the best BBQ I have had since moving to Chicago 5 years go. I had the St. Louis style ribs with the Memphis sauce and they were out of this world good!  The tang and sweetness of the sauce. With the smoky taste of the ribs was a perfect blend. Even without sauce the ribs were amazing!  Fall of the bone tender and juicy, perfect flavor of the rub and the meat. I thought I had gone to rib heaven. I live in  West Town and have often eaten at Smoke Daddy. Their food is great but after eating the ribs at Smoque I will only eat here!!!!!!! AMAZING!!!!!!!!  The Mac and cheese was fabulous too!
