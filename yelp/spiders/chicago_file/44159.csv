Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Even though this place has been around for over 30 years, I went there for the 1st time about a month ago.  I have been back 3 times since.  It is a very lively atmosphere and the food comes out quickly and is always spot on.  The staff will walk you through the menu and is very helpful in case you are unfamiliar with the tapas/small plate concept.
