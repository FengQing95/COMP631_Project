Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I understand that pizza takes time to cook but they should not have told us it would be ready in 30-35 minutes when it took over an hour. The pizza was pretty good but the whole situation was dampened by our poor service. We were convinced our waiter was on drugs, he was just overall confused about life.
