Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's has earned a number 3 spot on my list of best places to get Chicago pizza.  Although the calamari appetizer was a little bland, the main course pizza was delicious!  They spare no ingredients when making your pie. The service was very courteous.  My only complaint is they made our ice cream dessert before we were done with our pizza so it melted by the time we were ready to eat it.  No fears, however, because they made us a new one!  Overall, good downtown environment, good food, at a reasonable price!
