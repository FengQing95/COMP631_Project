Little Goat Diner////2. FOOD: on this visit, it was breakfast for dinner with the Bull's Eye French Toast.  Egg-washed Texas toast, served with an egg over-easy, smothered with melted cheese, strawberries, chopped chicken tonkatsu (think deep fried chicken breast meat) and maple syrup.  Yum - if only they served it with a third piece of French toast!
