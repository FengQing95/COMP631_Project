The Purple Pig////OMG! This is place is absolutely amazing. Undoubtedly, one of the best tapas places I have been to. I loved the food and wine here. The tag 'wine and swine' is spot on! The place doesn't take reservations so we had to wait for sometime to get seated. In the meantime, we were enjoying wine in the open seating. We really liked their wine collection. The food is brilliant. We tried the pig ears, roasted bone marrow, braised pork shoulder, and octopus with beans and salsa verde. All of these are popular choices and everything was delicious.
