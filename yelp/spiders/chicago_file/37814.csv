Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We arrived on-time (~1-2 minutes early for our reservation and checked in + checked our coats. We were directed to the waiting area where we sat for almost 10 minutes before a waiter came to offer us a drink menu. We then selected drinks, but it took nearly another 10 minutes to get him back to take our drink order. Mind you, this whole time we were watching our table... Clean and waiting for us... Not 2 minutes after placing our drink order, The hostess then decided to seat us but before she did abruptly stopped and walked off to see if it would "even be possible" to transfer our drink order.
