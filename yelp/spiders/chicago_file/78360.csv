Little Goat Diner////I also ordered a cinnamon roll and the scallion pancake with pork belly to go for the plane. Both were still delicious a few hours later! Chicago really does Asian fusion really well and I was super impressed. I can't wait to come back and try other breakfast entrees as well as the Girl and the Goat.
