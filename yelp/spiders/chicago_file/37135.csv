Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For the entree, we both ordered the steak frites.  Again, absolutely delicious, especially with the Bearnaise sauce.  My mistake was ordering it medium well because the edges were drier than I liked, but that was my fault.  BF order his medium rare and couldn't stop raving about it.  I was too stuffed to make a dent in the fries, which were nicely seasoned, but BF ate all of his and some of mine.
