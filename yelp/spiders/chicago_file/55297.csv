Smoque BBQ////I love the layout and presentation of the food. You order a dish and it comes with two sides, or you can get them a la carte. When your order is ready, it's presented on a tray lined with wax paper and the sides come in their separate containers so that there's no cross contamination of different dishes (not that I mind that at all). Â The portions appear small, but if you're visiting and want to try a little bit of everything, the smaller portions are excellent for that. My favorite was the corn bread, BBQ beans, peach cobbler and the St. Louis Ribs. The St. Louis ribs are to die for. I've yet to have a tender, slide off the bone rib since I lived in Texas. So this place, being NOT anywhere near Texas and having an assortment of BBQ and sides definitely made my 30~ minute drive from our hotel near Lake Michigan worth it. We also ordered chili soup, pulled pork, bbq chicken, fries, slaw and mac and cheese. Also, if you want to try something, but not sure if you want to order the WHOLE order, there's a few items you can "sample" for an additional cost at the end of the middle panel. That is what I did with the St. Louis Ribs. Afterwards I wished I had gotten the WHOLE RACK!
