Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This lives up to the hype !! We tried to come for dinner but it was jam packed and a 45 minute wait so we decide decided to go back the next day for lunch. We went back the next day and were seated immediately ! We knew the deep dish takes a while so we order bruschetta , minestrone soup and I ordered a small dinner salad which was pretty big ! My friend ordered a personal cheese but my other friend and I got the "Lou" oh my god - heaven the butter crust is out of this world the first bite was a divine tasting explosion ! This place lives up to the hype please do yourself a favor and come here you won't regret it for dessert we shared a peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream it was perfect as we were all stuffed prices are very reasonable too. Our waiter was great too !
