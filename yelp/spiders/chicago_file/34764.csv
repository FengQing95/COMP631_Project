Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////So the picture is obviously dark, an homage to Sodikoff's lighting scheme, but shows the wonderful plating of the salmon tartare dish, serving a healthy dollop of finely chopped salmon, nicely seasoned with a bit of pepper to give it just a bit of spice that was balanced perfectly by a scoop of creme fraiche. Â The thinly crisped lavash provides an excellent vessel to scoop up bites off of the plate.
