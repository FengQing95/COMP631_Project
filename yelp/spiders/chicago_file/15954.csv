Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////You could order your pizza while you waited for a table but not anything else. Anything else you want with your meal you have to wait till you sat down. We ordered a individual 6" pizza to share and a humongous family style salad. It was still too much food for the two of us. The pizza was a perfect reasonable portion size. Â We also ordered a spinach bread appetizer which was fantastic! But that really put us over the top. Luckily we took a doggy bag and one Chicago homeless man ended up eating our leftovers for us. Better then is going to waste!
