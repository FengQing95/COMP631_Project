Little Goat Diner////This review is based on the Valentine's Dinner held upstairs at Little Goat Diner previewing the food at Cabra.  Since Stephanie Izard is my favorite, we go to this dinner every year and once again, she did not disappoint.  This year the format of the dinner changed and it seems as if the price went up. (Neither here nor there). From beginning to end, each course did not disappoint.  The richness and complexity of the food made us excited for when the actual Cabra restaurant opened up (writing that review next).  Stephanie definitely has a talent for creating deliciousness that is appreciated. We couldn't decide which was our favorite course because they were all so good!
