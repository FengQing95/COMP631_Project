Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Because I had not tried any other Chicago style pizza at the time I tried Lou Malnati's I felt it wasn't fair to give it the full five stars. Plus, the server waiting our table was not as attentive as he could have been. Other than taking our order and bringing our food, he checked on us maybe about one more time. It was somewhat busy and I understand but I noticed other tables were getting just a little more attention than ours.
