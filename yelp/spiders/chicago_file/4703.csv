The Purple Pig////I also really like this place because of its commitment to high quality food. On my previous visit, the chef wasn't satisfied with the cook on a plate of bone marrow for another table and a server asked if we wanted it for no charge. I couldn't believe it because even the rejected bone marrow was SO good.
