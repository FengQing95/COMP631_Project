Little Goat Diner////The goat chili cheese fries were out of this world! The yoda juice was an amazing cocktail. I found the chocolate malt pancakes were a little overcooked and needed syrup, but everything else was great. Service was friendly and attentive, but reservations do take a month or more for prime times! The Los Drowned came with a terrific au jus, and the crab dip was flavorful and not overwhelmingly fishy. We'll definitely be back - we didn't get to try the deserts yet!
