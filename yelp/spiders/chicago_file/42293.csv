Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////If you have a decent-sized group, I hightly recommend you go here for the best tapas in the city.  Yes, better than Cafe Iberico.  Me and a group of 20 ran up a $900 bill, and it was worth every penny, especially since someone else was footing the bill.  The sangrias are tasty.  I recommend the original red, the passion fruit, or the cava.  The chicken paella is tasty (and you can add shrimp for a small charge) but keep in mind that it takes a while to prepare.  You will be stuffing your face with other tapas while you wait for the paella to come out.  Now on to the tapas!  I highly recommend the garlic shrimp, the beef tenderloin & bleu cheese, ANY of the empanadas, the dates wrapped with bacon, the mushrooms stuffed with spinach & manchego cheese, and the spicy potatoes.  You can't go wrong with the dessert menu, but I recommend the apple crisp with ice cream and the mango sorbet.
