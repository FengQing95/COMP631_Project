Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My cousin and I decided to order a whole pie after a couple hours out at the bar (a good idea at the time but terrible for my body). Over the next 3 days we were able to devour the entire thing which seems like a long time but one slice will leave you sitting on the couch for a couple of hours. Be careful when eating it though two slices will put most people in a temporary food coma, my cousin made that mistake on a Sunday afternoon and I lost him for the rest of the day. Also don't exercise at any point after you eat it. I made the mistake of running a couple hours after and had to stop after cramping up.
