Little Goat Diner////Had breakfast here the other day. Absolutely loved the vibe, sat at a cozy little two top against the wall. Ordered nachos... yes, breakfast was at 11:30. Always on the hunt for some really worth it nachos and these were fantastic! My friend ordered the hash browns which had the perfect, little amount of cheese and this little pig went to China. I had some of all and it was deliciousness! He had to stop me from ordering a bann mi burger as well because my eyes were waaayyy bigger than my stomach. Coffee was excellent, service was excellent. Cannot wait to return... and to visit the Girl and the goat as well!
