Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here on Saturday around 9pm and were told that for 2, the wait was an hour. Heading into the bar to grab a pitcher or 2 of Sangria for our long expected wait, we found that the seats in the bar were opening up every few minutes. Being famished after a day of moving, we removed our name from the list and sat at the bar. The bartender was not friendly, but was very attentive and gave excellent service. I just love the Sangria. Can't go wrong with any flavor. Black Raspberry, Red, White Mango, etc. Half the fun is picking out which to try next!
