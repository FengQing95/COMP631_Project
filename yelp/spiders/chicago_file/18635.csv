Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Food here is good, as with any Lou Malnati's in the city.  The service, however, is lacking.  We got seated fast enough on a Sunday afternoon but it took almost 10 minutes for a server to come by to take drink orders. While I totally understand the time it takes to cook the pizza, the servers did not come by to cut our second slices and getting the check and paying the check took a long long time.  Advice to management - please have more servers or have them check in on tables more often.
