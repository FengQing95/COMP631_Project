Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went with a group of friends to try out the tapas. I had heard it is a famous spot but did not know what to expect. We were promptly seated after reaching the restaurant even though it was a Sunday afternoon. The menu has lots of sweet and savory options for tapas. We ordered the Burrata with tomato bread, spinach artichoke crepe, and buttermilk pancake with banana and fresh hazelnut spread. The burrata was creamy and complemented the tomatoes bread and arugula perfectly. The spinach artichoke crepe was flaky and delicious. And then buttermilk pancake with homemade Nutella was a must have. Everyone enjoyed what they ordered and portions were a shareable size for tapas. Highly recommend checking out this spot!
