Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Quality of the food - I love the food. This was the second time I have been there in two months. I love that you can go with a group of people and order different things and pass them around. The food is amazing. The first time I went there was a first date and we shared our plates. The second time I went there, it was a birthday party and we passed the different tapas around the table. The food was so delicious.
