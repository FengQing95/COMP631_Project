Smoque BBQ////You place your order at the counter, much like a deli, and are given a number. We ordered from a bored young girl who couldn't have looked more unhappy to be there. Within mere minutes, your number is yelled out for you to walk back up to pick up your tray. Okay, so in a deli, your food can be made-to-order within minutes, but BBQ? No. So the food is not made-to-order. You can BYOB or serve yourself at a soda station, not unlike, again, a deli or McDonald's or Burger King.
