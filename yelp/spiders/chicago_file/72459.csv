Little Goat Diner////We came here to hang out upstairs a couple days ago for a roof party. Sponsored by Founders and Bells, they were offering cans from those breweries along with a pre-mixed cocktail. We chose the cocktail which was a cherry limeade. It didn't taste too strong initially but it definitely had a little punch to it. It was super crowded upstairs and folks were just lurking around the chairs waiting for others to get up so they could snag their spots. It was also a million degrees so we enjoyed just our one drink and headed out. Having dined across the street at the Girl and the Goat a couple times, I really would love to--and am just looking for the right time to--come back here to try the grub. The roof is the place to be here in the summer!
