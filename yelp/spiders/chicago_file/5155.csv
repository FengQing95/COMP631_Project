The Purple Pig////Food was good but heavy. Even the apps. We got the fried pork ears with crispy kale and runny egg (10/10), smoked pork Jowl with a potato/pasta salad (6/10- was too mayo-y and vinegar-y) and grilled broccoli tossed in garlic anchovy (9/10- would have liked the broccoli a little crunchier but the sauce was spectacular).
