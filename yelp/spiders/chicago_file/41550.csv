Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went here with a large group of girlfriends to celebrate an engagement, and I was very impressed.  We were seated at a table with plenty of room, and we each ordered a few tapas to share with the group.  Literally everything I tried was fantastic!  I really have not had better tapas anywhere in the city.  It can get pretty crowded and noisy on the weekends, but definitely a great spot to try new things and have a great meal with friends.
