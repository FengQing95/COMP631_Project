Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I went early one night around 5 though and avoided the crowds. I got the small deep dish with extra cheese and mushrooms. I love the cast iron pan it comes in at the table. So how was it? I'm a New Yorker, therefore we don't get deep dish unless you go to a Pizzeria Uno chain in New Jersey. So i was looking forward to the authentic real thing. The pizza was tasty, definitely cheeeeeeesy and had a really nice savory tomato sauce with just the right amount of sweetness but there are two critiques I have.
