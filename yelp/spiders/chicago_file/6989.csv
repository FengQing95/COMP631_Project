Art Institute of Chicago////I'm a museum junkie.  When I travel to a major city, I like to pack a lunch and spend all day in a place like the Louvre or Met.  You could spend an hour here at the AIC, or just about all day.  If you only have an hour, see the Impressionism or whatever special exhibit they have.
