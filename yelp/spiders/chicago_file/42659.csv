Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We finished off with dessert.  Right when we sat down for our meal, I mentioned to our server that I had a yelp check-in offer for free dessert.  She acknowledged this, and brought us the dessert menu at the end of the meal.  Since the check in coupon said stated "1 free dessert tapa of your choice PER GUEST," each of us ordered one dessert tapa.  She took our order, and I asked if she wanted to see the check-in coupon.  She said, "nah, I know it."
