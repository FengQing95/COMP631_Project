Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////All in all, their classic Chicago pizza was delicious. We ordered a medium pizza for three people, not including myself (though I wasn't that hungry at the time). Having two smaller women in our group was a key factor in a size decision as I think the large would've been too much food. Seriously though, one slice of the large is enough to be a meal. That being said, be careful in choosing a size. Look at other pizzas that people have ordered to get a good idea of how much you'll need.
