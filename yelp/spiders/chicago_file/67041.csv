Little Goat Diner////The Rooftop Bar is amazing. I love how it is totally acceptable that you could bring your family here and, unlike a lot of trendy food places, no one really minds. The chili cheese fries are to die for, the fried pickles were the best thing I've had fried in a long time (bread and butter genius), tThe pork belly pancake had great flavor (a little short on the pork belly) and the Beef Sandwich was incredibly tender. The Mac and cheese was killer as a big enough side for the table to share. The only thing I didn't love was the dish I ordered, the fish tostadas. They were OK. Could have used more depth of flavor.
