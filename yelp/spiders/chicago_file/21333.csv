Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So this is kinda crazy, but we came here for the pizza and left raving about the salad! Don't get me wrong, the pizza was amazing...everything that I wanted a Chicago deep dish pizza to be! (Make sure you get the butter crust!) But we shared a Malnati salad before our pizza came out and it was the best salad I've ever had. I wish I could eat bowls of it every night!
