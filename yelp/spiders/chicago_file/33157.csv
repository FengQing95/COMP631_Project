Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Went for our 5 years anniversary! Very cool, trendy decor, friendly staff and great food!! The bread basket was superb! We had the rib eye and the petit filet mignon, both wonderful!! Some mashed potatoes that were delish and the chocolate cream pie was just heavenly!! We will definitely go back
