Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Quick service,  decent tapas,  and nice space.   However,  forget about a peaceful meal.  During their usual busy lunch it is much louder than we cared for.  Another issue is the very salty squid.. it would be nice to taste the squid, not the ocean it came from.  Pretty good,  but for the price,  one could certainly do better.   A solid three stars.
