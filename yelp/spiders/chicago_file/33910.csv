Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I asked my friend for a recommendation on an "old man steakhouse" and she suggested Bavette's.  Great call!  It's just about as cool as it gets.  I'm not sure that there were leather bound books, but it had all the atmosphere and character you could hope for--wood paneling, vintage chairs, a beautiful bar, classic light fixtures, patinaed mirrors.
