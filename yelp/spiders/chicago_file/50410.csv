Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////While the ambiance is wonderful (especially the sun room) this place works much better for groups than for dates. Whenever I go with just 1-2 other people the bill is always pretty steep but it's never bad when there's a big group. I had my birthday here this past year, and the service was wonderful, even when it came to taking a bunch of different credit cards. Call to make reservations on open table at least a few days before hand for weekdays, and give even more notice on the weekends.
