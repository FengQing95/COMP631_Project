Smoque BBQ////I added on a 1/4 slab of st. louis ribs. DRY, NASTY, NOT MEATY at all. I know there are two different kinds...but seriously bad. My daughter who loves bbq and ribs of all sorts.....stuck her nose up to these doozys and ate frenchfries for dinner that night. I don't care for the excesive tartness of the BBQ sauce either.
