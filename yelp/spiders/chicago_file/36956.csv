Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The bone-in grass fed ribeye was cooked to perfection (med-rare) with a nice gamey taste and light enough on the marbling to give it great juiciness without the fat. The meat nearest the bone was beyond tender and flavorful. Accompanying were perfectly grilled asparagus and a mashed potato that was balanced between creamy yet stiff and delicious.
