Little Goat Diner////I went to Little Goat for dinner a few weeks ago at the urging of my friend. She had been there plenty of times while I had Little Goat on my list of places to still try in Chicago. We made a reservation before hand so when we arrived at 7pm on a Saturday our wait for a table was only a few minutes. The first thing I noticed about this place is how cool the decor is. The tables and booths all look like they belong in a diner however the fixtures and lighting make this place very classy. We managed to get a booth which was really comfortable however the bar area by the kitchen looked like a cool place to dine.
