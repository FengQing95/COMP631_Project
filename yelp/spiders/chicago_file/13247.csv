Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////What can I say. I've been eating Lou's for over 2 decades now.  I was raised on this stuff from a very young age.  We usually went to the Naperville or Schaumburg outpost, but I was in the city so we went here.  Food was good, although the pizza had way too much garlic on it and we didn't request it.  Only complaint was that the manager told us we would be getting half off our entire meal at the start of it, only to find out that he got in trouble for giving us half off everything not just the food, so we had to pay for our drinks full price.  Would have been nice to know that all the drinks we were ordering were not going to be half off at the beginning, but I was grateful we go somewhat of a discount I guess. I love LOUS!!!
