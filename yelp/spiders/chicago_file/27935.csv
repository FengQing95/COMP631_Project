Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The epitome of Chicago deep dish.  You gotta go with the Chicago classic if you've never been here before.  It's always crowded during the dinner rush so I'd recommend getting a table early.  Service can summer if your waiter gets stuck with a huge party.  Lou's and Giordanos are 1a and 1b for me and I can't visit the Windy City without paying either a visit.  I really like the flavor and buttery crust of the Lou's pie.  Can't go wrong here.
