Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm not too crazy about pizza, but this place is not your average pizza. Personally I've always loved thin crust pizza, but after having this deep dish pizza I may have to change my mind. They offer the option to split your pizza in half in terms of toppings/flavoring so I decided I wanted to try their top recommended pizzas. And I absolutely loved the Lou even though there was no meat in that pizza. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to make but well worth the wait. The crust and the bottom of the pizza is perfectly crispy, while the contents of the cheese and everything is full of flavor. It's just a really solid pizza and by far my favorite pizza place. I've had pizza in New York and in Texas, but hands down if I'm ever back in Chicago this is the place I'll be at for pizza.
