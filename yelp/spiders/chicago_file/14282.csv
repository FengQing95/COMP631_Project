Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First off, the customer service was well above and beyond anything I've experienced in a long time.  We were  Second, food was brought out quickly and tasted very good.  The pizzas ordered (a medium Lou and a medium pepperoni and mushroom) were cooked to perfection.  Nice, crispy, flaky, yeasty crust with a hint of sweet mixed in with the sour, topped with a thin layer of cheese and nice, fat crushed tomatoes as a base.  The Lou is a grand tasting pizza, but Lou's also does the basics very well.  The pepperoni was tasty and the mushrooms were cooked well and not soggy in the least.  I'm actually surprised at how well the pizzas were done.
