Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Cornmeal crust is so tasty. Always the best texture and cooked to perfection. It's just a matter of taste, but I'm not into the sausage patty. But I do prefer any of the other topping combos. I usually only get the deep dish, but have had the thin crust and it's just as comparable in quality and taste.
