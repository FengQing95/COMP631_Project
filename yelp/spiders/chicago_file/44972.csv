Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I was very underwhelmed by Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba.  The sangria was good, but that's about the only good thing about the place.  The food was just so-so.  The tomato bread with prosciutto was literally cold, soggy bread slathered with tomato sauce.  The garlic shrimp was just so-so.  Our waitress never came back to check on us despite the fact that the restaurant wasn't really that crowded.  The atmosphere was fun, but the restaurant does not really focus on customer service.  Also, the whole place also had this weird overly potent smell of garlic.
