Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I can only speak for the food because we ordered delivery from them. It was absolutely delicious!! We would recommend this pizza over Giordano's! Lou Malnati's pizza is more tender and the best pizza we have ever had. The butter crust is fantastic! You can't go wrong with this pizza! This is a must for tourists!
