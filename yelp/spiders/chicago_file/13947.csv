Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm by no means a deep dish pizza conosour, but I do love food and I must say this place was worth the wait.  The sauce is AMAZING!!  We ordered two pizzas, one with just pepperoni and sausage (my favorite) and a pepperoni, peppers and mushrooms.  The sausage was superb and complementes the flacota on the sauce.  I would come back again the next time I am in Chicago for sure.
