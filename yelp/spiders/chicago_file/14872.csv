Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The top thing on my agenda when I visited Chicago was to eat deep dish pizza. My friends recommended Lou Malnati's and while I can't compare it to other Chicago joints, I can say it was pretty damn good. My friend and I split a medium sausage pie (she was a girl, so we had leftovers). First of all, how do you make a sausage patty that big? Yeah, rather than sprinkling bits of sausage around the pizza, they make one giant pizza-sized sausage patty and throw it on there. Genius. And they blend their own sausage, which is delicious.
