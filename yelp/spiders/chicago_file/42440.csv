Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Best Tapas in Chicago! There wasn't one item we ordered that I did not love. Service was great and our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu. Some of the outstanding plates for me were: goat cheese croqueta, bacon wrapped dates, paella valenciana and the butterscotch custard cream.
