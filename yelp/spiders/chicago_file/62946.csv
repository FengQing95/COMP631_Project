Smoque BBQ////I really wanted to give Â 3 stars. I did 4 out of peer pressure. Smoque is well...smoky....smoky tasting that is. I liked the baked beans but they are too smoky. I wish they had one or two more choices of bbq sauce. The fries are amazing. The peach cobbler tasted like canned peaches with a little granola on top. Not that great. The tables are a tight squeeze. Good if you are into chatting with your neighbors. I'm not. The cole slaw was surprisingly fresh and yummy. The meats were good. The pork is amazing. The bbq sauces are just ok.
