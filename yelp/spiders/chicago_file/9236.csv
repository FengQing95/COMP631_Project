Art Institute of Chicago////Being a Chicago native (okay, suburbs, but whatever), the Art Institute was a destination for several field trips in elementary and middle school.  The last time I visited I was with a friend in her first year of college, and she needed to hurriedly study the Chinese art.  It involved dashing from one plaque to another for her to complete a homework assignment.  This is not the way I'd recommend seeing the Art Institute.  The museum is huge, and if you want to see everything, you will need at least two hours.  However, if you want to narrow down exactly what you want to see, you can get through here within 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
