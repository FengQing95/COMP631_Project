Little Goat Diner////Moving on to the food, had a really good omelette of the day with eggplant and scallions (and I don't even like  omelettes...) Topped with fried onions that were a surprisingly yummy contrast in texture.  Would have been nice to know that it doesn't come with anything (i.e. toast) but wasn't about to wait another 10 min for the waiter to walk by again to order some...
