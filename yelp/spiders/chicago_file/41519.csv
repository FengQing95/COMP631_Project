Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is always a fun place to go! If you are a sangria fan, definitely give them a try.  The house white is delicious, and I also love the passion fruit sangria.  Favorites: lamb kabobs, sweet potato with pomegranate alioli, tres leche cake, and the vanilla flan! I went for a night out with my girlfriend, and it was very affordable.  It ended up being around $75 before tip; this included a pitcher of sangria, several tapas, and dessert! Tip: check in on yelp and get a free dessert :)
