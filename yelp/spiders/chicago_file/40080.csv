Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've tried every single item on their menu, and with the exception of the bone marrow (overhyped) and the baked potato (good, not great) absolutely nothing has disappointed me. Even their crab cake (at a non seafood focused steakhouse) is extraordinary. The aged ribeye is their second best steak offering (behind the bone in filet), and either of those could go up against any steak out there (including A5 Wagyu) and give it a run for its money. They offer the authentic Au Cheval burger (rated #1 in the US by critics and diners alike) on their menu with their famous bacon (really, pork belly). The mushrooms are the best side I've ever eaten. The truffle Mac n cheese is super rich but outstanding on its own since the truffle is not overbearing.
