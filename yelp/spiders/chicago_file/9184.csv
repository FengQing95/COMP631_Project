Art Institute of Chicago////You can take pictures of any non-special exhibits.  They even encourage you to upload your pics to their Flickr pool.  I had such a great time wandering around by myself, and I'd recommend it to anyone in town.  (In fact, I probably have to tell my friend who's been living in Chicago for the past couple years and hasn't been, to get off her ass and get over there!)
