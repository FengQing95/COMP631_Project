Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The waitress we had, good god, I wish I could remember her name, was really attentive.  To the point where we wondered if she had mistaken us for some of those secret-shopper type of patrons and was showing off.  She kept the wine recommendations coming, and was always willing to answer our questions when we'd see something we liked on someone else's table and go, "ooh, what's SHE got?"
