Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza: full disclosure I'm from NY and generally do not like deep dish pizzas but I really liked how this one tasted. The ingredients were spot on, but since I'm not a Chicago style guy, it tended to feel like cheesy tomato soup in a bread bowl at times (again its the NY bias).
