Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I am not sure why the place got four stars. The food was very standard for a tapas place. I went with 3 other girls. We ordered 2 plates each for sharing. Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, ahi tuna, garlic shrimp, crispy potatoes, meatballs, short ribs, one chicken dish and bacon wrapped dates. We also had churros for dessert. Nothing was good at all.
