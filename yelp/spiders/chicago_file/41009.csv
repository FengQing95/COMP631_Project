Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Hands-down, my favorite place for tapas. There are very few things I've ordered and didn't like, and I always find the waiters to be very knowledgeable about the menu and able to make great recommendations. It's hard to start a list of my favorite things here but it's always fun to start out with the pintxos platter. When I start ordering tapas, I almost always include the spicy potatoes, the goat cheese in tomato sauce, and the meatballs with sherry tomato sauce. A pitcher of sangria is a must and seating on the patio is lovely in the summer.
