Little Goat Diner////UPDATE:  I'm updating my review from 5 starts to 4.   I still love this restaurant and will return again.   But some mention must be made of the unnecessarily high menu prices.   Yes, I know that innovative dining establishments should charge a bit more -- especially if they are in a trendy neighborhood.  But come on!  $11 for pancakes?   $3.50 for a soft drink?   Feels like a bit of a gouge.
