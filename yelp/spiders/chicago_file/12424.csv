Art Institute of Chicago////I love this museum.  It has been a few years since I've been to Chicago and the first thing I always want to visit is the Art Institute.  I've discovered this place years ago and heard about the large collection they have of impressionist art.  This time around I accidentally discovered a miniature collection at the basement.  It was pretty amazing and what a discovery.  I wish I had more time to explore the newly expanded museum.  They now have an ultra modern addition in the back.  Love the Georgia O'Keefe painting in the back stairwell.  This place never disappoints.  Will be back again soon.
