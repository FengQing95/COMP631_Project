Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Cocktails were very good, they have a few different old fashions and mine was done well.  Ambiance is one of the things you're paying for here, it's very comfortable with two different feels on the top and lower levels.  We were seated on the lower level which is a bit more lounge-like, but it was still nice.
