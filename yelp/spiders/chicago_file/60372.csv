Smoque BBQ////We were witnesses to a funny thing while eating.  The gentleman I took for the owner and one of his employees were having a conversation near the exit on the side.  As the line pushed toward the door, a well-heeled looking older lady seemed annoyed that they weren't following the line towards the cash registers.  "Excuse me, are you in line?"  Come on, lady.  You may not know that he runs the place, but he's wearing a white coat and checkered pants; he clearly works here.  But surely it's plausible that if he were employed elsewhere he'd cheat on his own kitchen for some Smoque.
