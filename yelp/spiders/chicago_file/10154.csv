Art Institute of Chicago////Impressive collection of pieces by Claude Monet within the Impressionist exhibit. Other highlights included the paperweight collection and the miniature rooms, both downstairs in the lower level. The entire establishment itself is beautiful and I thought that two hours to roam around was plenty.
