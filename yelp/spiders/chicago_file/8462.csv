Art Institute of Chicago////Great museum with a lot to see. The European art including renaissance era pieces were amazing and if you appreciate history there is a lot within the works of art here. Also probably the best museum food/drink offered that i've seen in Chicago. Overall a must see if you're visiting Chi Town.
