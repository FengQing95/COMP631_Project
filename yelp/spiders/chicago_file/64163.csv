Smoque BBQ////I had lunch here on 11-30-2016.  This was my first visit.  I ordered the smoked turkey breast on white bread with Memphis BBQ sauce and potato salad.  The smoked turkey breast was very good.  Moist, flavorful and plentiful.  The bread was very soft, like room temperature.  I loved it.  The potato salad was crunch.  It was more like a pasta salad than a potato salad.  It contained scallions, celery, potatoes with the peel still on them, but it didn't contain any eggs that I could tell.  I went based upon a coworker's recommendation.  It was good BBQ, which is what I will stick to ordering on my next visit.
