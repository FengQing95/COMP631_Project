Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////THIS...IS...PIZZA...PERIOD!  I've been to several Chicago locations, and hands down, it is my favorite pizza restaurant in America.  I know many Americans prefer thin crust, or New York style, but I have to vehemently disagree with them.  Lou's is the place to go in Chicago, and I wish they had a few restaurants in South Florida.  Yes, I know you can have a pie shipped to you, but nothing beats a fresh pie at the actual restaurant.
