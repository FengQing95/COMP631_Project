Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////* Buttery Mashed Potatoes. A standard side which every Chicago restaurant seems to have. It was fine, good not great. I would get it again but if I went back I would try something else. Thankfully it was not drenched in butter nor cream like many of the places in this town tend to do. It was good.
