Art Institute of Chicago////The best collection in Chicago with touring collections only seen in NYC and Los Angeles otherwise. Pre and during Covid, the Warhol exhibit showed here before anyplace. If you're an Illinois resident, check their website, as there is free admission several days each month with your state ID. Also, most museums in Chicago participate in the program that allows anyone on SNAP/EBT free admission every day. That doesn't include special exhibits, but it's a very good deal a lot of folks don't know about. A must see if you appreciate fine art and you find yourself in Chicago. Easy location via transit. I'm unsure about parking, but everything is handicapped accessable. Go!
