Little Goat Diner////My husband made reservations for my birthday and with my food allergies, I'm quite apprehensive to eat out. Little Goat has a dairy-free menu (bonus) and since I have a soy allergy the waitress Â knew already that the kitchen used soy oil to fry--awesome. Many places don't know so I was thrilled.
