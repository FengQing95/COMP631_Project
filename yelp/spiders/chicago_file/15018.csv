Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My friend and I went here in search of Gluten Free Pizza and they have it! It's great, with a sausage crust and while it sounds weird, it's really good. For non-gluten free peeps like me, just be wary of eating as much as you would a regular pizza....it's a LOT of meat. I would recommend getting a couple toppings to balance out all the meat.
