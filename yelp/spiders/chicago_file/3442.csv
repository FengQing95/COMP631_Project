The Purple Pig////Such a good spot to go to around 2PM where the wait is not as crazy. We were so in love with the food that within our five day trip in Chicago, we swung right back to the Purple Pig to try out their other dishes - that and we didn't have a belly for dessert the first time, PRIORITIES.
