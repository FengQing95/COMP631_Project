Smoque BBQ////Others at the table got brisket (thumbs up) and someone got the fries, which came in a mini brown bag that soon became grease-soaked. They were regular-sized fries, just simple tossed in like salt and pepper, but still had the skin on. And they were fried to perfection. As we finished one by one, some guy came by and took away some of our trays for us.
