Art Institute of Chicago////By girl put it best, "I could spend a whole day in here."  This is very true.  I have never experienced so many pieces of original art.  I loved seeing the strange, yet intriguing pieces of Ivan Albright and not to mention the numerous pieces of Impressionist art from van Gogh!  My only regret is that I had not visited the museum before now.
