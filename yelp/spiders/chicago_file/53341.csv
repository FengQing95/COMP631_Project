Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My recommendation to anyone visiting for the first time is try the specials (off menu/verbal specials) and drink sangria by the pitcher. On my last visit to Baba Reeba my girlfriend and I got a cute table near the kitchen and went to town ordering. We each got one dish just for ourselves, she had the hanger steak and gave it a 10/10 and I had the raw tuna with jalapenos and it was also diving 10/10.
