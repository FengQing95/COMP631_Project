The Purple Pig////I was so excited that this place was a short walk from my hotel. I had to wait for a seat at the bar--for a Sunday night the place was packed! But once I looked at the menu I could tell why. There were so many items I wanted to try, but as I was there on my own, I went for the pork belly. The sauce was a tad sweet, but the hint of espresso cut it, as well as the radish garnish.
