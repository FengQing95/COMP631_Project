Art Institute of Chicago////I came during Free February and paid for the $6 audio tour. There is an Edvard Munch exhibit ($20 per ticket) which I skipped, figuring a first-timer wouldn't have time for the whole museum, let alone an extra exhibit. I think I was right, as I spent about three hours there and still didn't see everything. It's huge, and I definitely had to ask for directions a couple of times.
