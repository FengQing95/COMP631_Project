Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We tried a bunch of different items and were stuffed by the time we left. There were 4 of us and honestly we could have done 2 less tapas and been satisfied. The tapas come out as they are ready so we like to order a few at a time, enjoy our drinks then order a few more. You can order from the brunch and main menu.
