Smoque BBQ////Of course everybody has their own opinion about what makes good BBQ, you're going to hear mine.  Their Brisket is always great-- tender and flavorful.  I'm not really a fan of the giant sweet bun they use for the sandwich though, its kind of a distraction from the meat.  Baked beans and Mac n' Cheese are perfect!  I get a quarter slab of St. Louis style ribs almost everytime I go because sometimes they are perfect (flavorful, smokey, chewy) but sometimes they can be a little dry and tough-- its a little bit of a crap shoot, but when you win you win big!  They use a dry rub that has a little bit of spice to it, and they pair it with a sauce that's a little more sweet.  People used to Chilli's or Applebee's boiled ribs will be in for a surprise!
