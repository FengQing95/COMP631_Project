Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou's is so delicious! My husband and I used to come here once a week on our date night. The ingredients are so fresh, and the tomato sauce is authentic Sicilian. The Chicago Classic was my husband's favorite, although I loved the Supreme. A must have if you will be visiting the area!
