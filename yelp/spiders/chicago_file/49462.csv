Smoque BBQ////But I came here for the brisket.  When I sat down, I was pissed that I forgot a knife.  Turned out I didn't need one.  The brisket was cooked to the point where it was almost disintegrating.  I doubt if it was sliced to order; if it was, whoever cut it has great knife skills.  The slices were barely holding together.  I was expecting great, and I got mediocre.  I'm no longer interested in trying out more of the menu.
