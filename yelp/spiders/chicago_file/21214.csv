Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ordered a small 1/2 and 1/2 deep dish, as recommended by our waitress so we could sample, and also a personal to taste another. This was plenty of food for two people. Also had an order of wings, buffalo style, and was very happy with the flavor and wing size (heavy on the drumsticks).
