Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Coming from Los Angeles, I would never claim to be a pizza aficionado, but my boyfriend used to live in Chicago and he is a pizza fiend. So, when we decided to visit there, this place was on the top of his list. THANK GOODNESS!!! Now, I like pizza, but I'm not a huge sauce person, so I was skeptical. I take it back, I do!! The pizza is SOO good. It's cheesy and the crust is slightly crunch on the outside and buttery, and then it all just melts together. The sauce is light and sweet, unlike most sauce.
