Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I visited for the first time during happy hour with coworkers. We called ahead as we were a group of about 15. When we got there the host, who was very curt, directed us to sit only at the bar and high top tables. Â I don't know if this is because happy hour is at the bar, but this was not a good first impression. Once seated, our waiter also was what I would describe as friendly. I was already over this place but then I had the food. I highly recommend the spicy potatoes. They are soo good! The beef empanadas and red sangria aren't bad either. And maybe best of all, we spent almost no money! Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, but if I was in the area, I'd happily pop in. And I'd recommend it to others.
