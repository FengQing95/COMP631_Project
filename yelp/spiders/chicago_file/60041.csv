Smoque BBQ////Dang. That's five star barbecue. I mean, holy shit, that was good. My buddy and I sat down to what looked like an immensity of meat, and plowed through like it was nothing. I usually don't eat beef, but that brisket was some of the best beef I have tasted. It wasn't exactly a blur, but it went down so fast and easy and good.
