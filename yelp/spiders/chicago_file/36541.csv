Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This was our first time going into this iconic steakhouse! The vibes are amazing and the energy truly feels like Alcap own! We ordered the beef straganoff It was well sautéed beef chopped up with mushrooms over a fettuccine Alfredo it was fantastic! Our waitress was amazing, I'm sorry I forgot her name! We also had the sautéed shrimp for an appetizer it was delicious! My husband had a classic steak medium rare and he loved it !!
