Little Goat Diner////I couldn't get reservations to "Girl and the Goat" so I thought we would try this. I kept an open mind and found that for a diner it's an A+, Good food! But I guess I just couldn't tell what vibe they were trying to give. The food was priced according to the area but it was just the atmosphere... An upscale diner???
