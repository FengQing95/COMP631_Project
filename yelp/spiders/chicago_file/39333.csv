Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For a main-course, I ordered the Traditional Filet Mignon (med-rare, duh) with Wild Mushroom enhancements. Steak was perfectly cooked, tender, juicy & amazing by itself, but then add in a few bites with Bernaise sauce & the earthy mushrooms and you have yourself something to write home about!
