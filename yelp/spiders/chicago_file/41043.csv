Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is your typical tapas restaurant.  There is nothing spectacular about it and nothing horrible about it.  Service was great lastnight and the food was pretty good.   I am still on the search for a tapas place that sets the bar.  The blackberry sangria is really good, and I thought the bacon wrapped dates were awesome (my date was not feeling them too much though),  The best thing about the experience was when I saw another eater taking photos of his food.  That reminded me to check in on yelp.  When I checked in, I had no idea that you could get free things from restaurants!  I was awarded a free pinxtos platter (which I had already ordered for 8.95).  Our waiter said that was the best gift he had seen all night, and took it right off of our bill.  THANKS YELP!! Don't forget to check in on your phone when you go here!
