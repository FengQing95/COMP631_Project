Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The atmosphere is a lot of fun, especially when you through Sangria into the mix! I love the tapas - they are so delicious and you get to try so many different kinds (especially if you come with a big group).  Our server convinced us to try the paella and I was not a big fan.  Definitely recommend sticking to the tapas if you come to this place.  Also, make sure you don't come during peak hours or you'll have quite the wait.
