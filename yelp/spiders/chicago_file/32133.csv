Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////What a wonderful experience this place was. Family friendly, date friendly, welcoming and warming. Their pizza was nothing less than amazing! We did a build your own where you got to pick from a lengthy list of toppings as well as a choice of crust made it hard to decide but what a mouth watering pizza this was. Pizza takes about 30 minutes to cook so if you are just wanting to pop in and out I wouldn't recommend but if you have that extra time to spare, trust me and try it! You definitely won't regret it.
