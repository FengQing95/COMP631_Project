Smoque BBQ////We got the chili, French fry, mac and cheese, peach cobbler, and pecan bread pudding on the sides.  They were all OK, but the peach cobbler crust was off the hook!  Give that a try, and the pecan pudding was really good too. Ask them if they can leave the sauce off though that was too sweet for me.
