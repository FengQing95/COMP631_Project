Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////1. Chorizo-wrapped mejdool date & cheese: With good ingredients (which these were), this one is hard to mess up. Almost sweet & rich enough to have for desert, however, so consider saving for later in the meal even though this will likely be one of the first dishes out of the kitchen.
