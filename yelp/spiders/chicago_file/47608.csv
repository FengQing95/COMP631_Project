Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Some of my favorite tapas dishes were the bacon wrapped dates; the flavor is unexplainable but bacon is worked in there so you know it's good. If you are obsessed with goat cheese like I am, get the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce with garlic bread slices. My mouth is watering writing about this. Â The spicy potatoes were good but not mind blowing and I could eat the dip that came with the calamari with a ladle.
