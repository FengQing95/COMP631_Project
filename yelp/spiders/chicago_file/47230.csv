Smoque BBQ////No ambiance here, but who cares? They treat you great! They make sure you get a table, they come around and ask how your food is, you really get the feeling they want you to enjoy yourself here. And the food....THE FOOD! Oh my gaaaaaaad, the sliced brisket is so tender you can cut it with a plastic fork. The ribs are fantastic, the sides are excellent (especially the smokey beans and mac & cheese) and I have to say it was the best cole slaw I've ever had. It almost tasted like cabbage salad with a vinaigrette. None of that soupy, creamy dressing. All in all this place was a smashing success with me and my dinner partner. We both loved it and plan to go back for the pulled pork and the hot links. I think I'll have to order them in addition to that brisket, though, because I simply must have that again!
