Smoque BBQ////This is by far the BEST BBQ I've ever had! I have to get the beef brisket every time, despite my contemplation to go for something different for once....BUT I love the brisket and by the time I get there, I've already made my mind up that I want that again. Haha. (That's when I just start trying things off of my boyfriend's plate) ;-) Anyway, the fresh-cut fries are to die for, the coleslaw is the best around, and the mac-and-cheese side option is awesome. Oh...and it's an absolute MUST to save room for dessert!
