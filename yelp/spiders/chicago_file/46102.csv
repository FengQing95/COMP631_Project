Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Really great place! Fun and lively atmosphere and delicious food! So many options for vegetarians! The spicy potatoes, stuffed mushrooms and the goat cheese are a must. My meat eating siblings also loved their food. Will definitely be be back! Only con was the passion fruit sangria. Too much ice/watered down :/
