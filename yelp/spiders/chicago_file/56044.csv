Smoque BBQ////I came in with a game plan - try the ribs and brisket along with the beans and macaroni and cheese.  Forgot to add the taste portion of the brisket (instead got the two half slabs of baby back and St. Louis style), BBQ beans, cole slaw, macaroni, and corn bread.  The ribs were both awesome, finger lickin' good!  Baby backs are still my favorite, but the St. Louis ribs with the dry rub really grew on me by the end.
