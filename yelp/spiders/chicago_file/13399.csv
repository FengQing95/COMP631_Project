Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////also, the waitress dropped someone's tomato/cheesy knife on my friends head while busing plates from another table.  thankfully, my friend kept consciousness, but her hair definitely needed a wash after that.  they did comp her meal though, which was greatly appreciated after the unpleasant experience.
