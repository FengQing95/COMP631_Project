Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our waitress was a short girl with dark/curly hair and long pointy nails.. didn't keep my receipt unfortunately to get her name. She took our order and after about 10 mins we got our drinks. We got our appetizer about 20 mins later which was fine. And it was good, a spinach bread with sauce. Although my husband found a hair in it, we really didn't care about that. We didn't get the personal deep dish pizza for another hour after. Which was weird because we saw another couple with a different server get 2 big deep dish pizzas before us and we got there before them. But whatever.. I understand things happens, but the problem was, our server never came and filled our waters the entire time so they were completely empty for an entire hour. We both ordered another beer and never got them. We were trying to get her attention and she ignored us. Another server delivered our pizza and we asked him for more water but never got it. So I was getting pretty irritated at this point and got up to try to find her to tell her we needed our check. I passed by the kitchen and saw her standing in there texting. I went back to the table and said let's just leave some cash on how much we think it is and get the hell out of here. At that point she finally came to our area and was at one of the other tables...and then she turned around to go back to the front again without even looking our way so I said "ma'am can we get our check and we don't need those beers we never got" lol I seriously couldn't help it.. she said "oh yeah I'm SO sorry about that" in a VERY rude tone. Then after 10 more mins she delivered our check we had our cash ready and said "here you go" trying to hand it to her as soon as possible.. she said "no let me drop this off first and it was someone else's check".. probably someone getting pissed like we were.. Â and so she didn't take it. At that point I was so done. The tables next to us felt our pain and were laughing with us since it was so ridiculous how horrible she was. We just left $40 which gave her an $8 tip but we didn't have to wait on change.
