Smoque BBQ////Went here for the first time and tried the ribs, brisket, and pulled pork.  They were all good but I think I like BBQ sauce less tangy and more on the sweet side.  The brisket and pulled pork BBQ sauce had an orange flavor to it which was okay, but again, not my favorite.  The baked beans had the same tangy flavor and the Mac and Cheese was good but not the best I ever had.  The corn bread was really good.  Worth going to for the atmosphere and good food but only once in awhile for me.
