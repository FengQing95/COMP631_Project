The Purple Pig////The food is great and the entire experience is very refined! We had the Spanish octopus, the milk braised pork shoulder, linguine and clams, and pink guava + fromage blanc mousse as a dessert! Waited about 45 minutes to get seated, they don't take reservations. The wait was worth it! I've never tasted an octopus so tender! It was an amazing experience and I'm so glad my friend recommended me to try this when I came to Chicago! It was my first time visiting The Purple Pig. We will be back!
