Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food was phenomenal and very generous portions. My husband and I split the small mixed greens and apple salad with their delicious champagne dressing which was perfectly garlicky. The shared the steak fries and the elite. The steak melted in your mouth and the elite had a slight kick which was divine. We can't wait to come back!!
