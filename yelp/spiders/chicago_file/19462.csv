Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First thing they tell you before you order is that their pizza's take 40 minutes to make.  If you're going to beat the busy times and get there early, call ahead and say that you'll be there soon and that you'd like to place your order.  We arrived and got our food about 20 minutes before everyone else in our section who got seated the same time we did.
