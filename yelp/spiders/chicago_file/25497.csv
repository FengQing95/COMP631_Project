Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It wasn't long before our pizzas came out. My wife and I found the small size to be perfect for the two of us to split. The crust was crisp despite being quite thick, the extra thick layer of cheese was yummy without being gut filling, the sauce had a nice texture and taste to it and the sausages on top were lean and paired nicely overall with the pizza. Usually my wife has to sponge the extra grease off the top of her pizza with a napkin but not at all here.
