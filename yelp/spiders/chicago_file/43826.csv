Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tapas are phenomenal...patatas bravas are my fave, I also love the tortilla espanola and anything with seafood. Lots of garlic in the dishes! The paella is also exceptional - I usually go for the mixta or the regular valenciana...can't go wrong with either. Perfectly moist, flavorful, and always a perfect soccarat at the bottom (browned rice at the bottom!).
