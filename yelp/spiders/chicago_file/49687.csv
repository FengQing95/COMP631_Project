Smoque BBQ////I came here once and I fell in love. One of my fave thing to get are the baby back ribs. That's what I usually get there but I felt like trying something different. So i tried the 1/2 and 1/2, a lil bit of pull pork and slice brisket. omg! it was sooooooo good!!! If you like bbq, this is the place to be. Although the dine-in experience is like a lunch room, but if you only care about the food then it wouldnt matter. Â I wouldn't recommend it for a romantic date.
