Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time here. Not the best deep dish pizza I have had in Chicago. Service was brusque and the pizza was served warm not hot. Noisy environment made talking with family difficult. Will not be going back. My impression was that turning over tables was more important than providing a good dining experience.
