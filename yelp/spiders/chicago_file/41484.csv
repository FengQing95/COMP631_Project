Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I would have to say this is my least favority tapas place in the city. I've been here once before and wasn't wowed by anything. Thus I was disappointed when my friends wanted to celebrate their bday's here. We first started with passion fruit sangria. It was meh as there wasn't much fruit flavor or alcohol in the drink. Their sangria is a total rip off. The pitcher was half full but we were charged for a full pitcher. *sigh*
