Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The meal was finished with 3 disappointing little deserts. I know tapas have small portions, but I like my deserts in big portions! There was one of each dessert for about every 3 people so, the little mini-cakes were even less satisfying. My half-bite of chocolate cake from what I could tell was good. There was a nut-log looking tart? that was just not for me. I did enjoy my own little mini-flan and that was one of the highlights of the night. It was cooked perfectly and sat on a little bed of coconut flakes.
