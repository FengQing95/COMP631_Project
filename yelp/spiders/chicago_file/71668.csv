Little Goat Diner////Absolutely fantastic experience. The wait time for a booth was a bit long and my three year old was starting to go stir crazy but The Little Goat staff held it together for us. I truly appreciate the warm hospitality from Skateboard/Mom Megan and concern they took in finding us a booth, entertainment for my cranky toddler and absolutely great customer service. On top of all of this, the food was excellent. Definitely worth the wait!
