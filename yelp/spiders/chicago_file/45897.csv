Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is one of my favorite places to take out-of-towners.  My friends and family from other mid-western cities aren't usually familiar with tapas, so I love to introduce it to them with BaBaReeba.  On top of that, it usually ends up being a very cheap meal compared to other establishments (I usually get out of there fat drunk and dumb for $35-40 a person).
