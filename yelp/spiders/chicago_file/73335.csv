Little Goat Diner////Anyway, other things that are probably relevant to people reading this review -- prices. A little pricey, two dollar signs, 10-15 bucks a meal. Portions are pretty big though, super satisfying, and the taste is unique, so I'm not complaining and neither are most people I take here.
