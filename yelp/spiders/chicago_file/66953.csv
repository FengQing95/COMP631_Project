Little Goat Diner////Nicest staff in the city hands down. Food is awesome. The smoked pork and toffee milkshake still haunts me dreams. Omg it is amazing. They make all their own breads and pastries. Went for breakfast the other day and added a side biscuit for some carbs. I don't even like biscuits. I inhaled this one. It was buttery flakey perfection. Been her multiple times and always leave with a smile on my face and a happy stomach. Must go when in town!
