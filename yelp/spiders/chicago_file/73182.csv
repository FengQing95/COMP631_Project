Little Goat Diner////Came here again and ordered the Korean burger, and unfortunately, I wasn't as impressed this time around by the food. The patty for the burger came out rather dry and slightly charred--and while I did ask for a medium well cook, I've definitely had patties elsewhere done medium well and still juicy. I also wish the patty itself was flavored with kimchi as well--the beef was rather plain and definitely needed the help of some seasoning. In fact, I found the entire burger was very dry overall--dry bun, dry patty, and the small amount of kimchi didn't help the situation much either.
