Smoque BBQ////IN ADDITION: I was just there with some friends... the place was packed but they went out of their way to make sure we ordered the best stuff... one guy gave us a consultation as we stood in line.. and man did it pay off! I will now always get the St Louis style ribs! Meatier than baby back. Who knew? He also went in the back and brought us candied jalapenos and an extra spicy sauce that they don't have on the table. He also dragged out a table for us to sit at... brought three chairs from the back. They really took care of us and we left totally satisfied! I LOVE THIS PLACE!
