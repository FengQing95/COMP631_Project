Smoque BBQ////Awesome BBQ- like the best in the city.  Worth the hike up north.  They also have really good peach cobbler and macaroni and cheese.  You will find there is a line however as anyone that goes here for good barbaque comes back it appears... even if it's raining.  It's a bit cramped for sitting down and eating a leisurely meal but they have a good system and get tables moved quick.  This place isn't 5 stars for ambience but if you want 5 star BBQ then this is the place.
