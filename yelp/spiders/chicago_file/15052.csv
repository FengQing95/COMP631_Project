Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm fully aware that travel time, standing time, etc... can lead to a pizza that isn't as great of quality as if I would have sat in the Lou Malnati's and ordered a pizza, but overall taste is only going to change to a certain degree. For this reason, I just cannot bring myself to award this nationally recognized deep dish joint any more stars at this point in time.
