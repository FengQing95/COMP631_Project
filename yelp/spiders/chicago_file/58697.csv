Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////For desert, I tried the chocolate cake. Even though it didn't appear to be made in the restaurant (seemed to have been made elsewhere), it was actually delicious. Thick and chocolatey with a creamy texture. It was also small - which I actually like. It took about 3 bites to finish. For $4, I can't complain - I prefer deserts that are on the smaller side. 4.5 stars out of 5.
