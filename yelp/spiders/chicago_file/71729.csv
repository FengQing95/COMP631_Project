Little Goat Diner////Went tonight to get lattes. Worst service I have ever had. The way the barista was looking while we were asking was just not cool. Then she didn't close the lid of the latte off. So when I went to grab my coffee it spilled every where. Another waiter comes and sees the mess I'm cleaning with my husband and friend and doesn't even take a second to ask if everything is ok or if we need help. I asked the barista to get a napkin and cup to because my latte is all spilled and she didn't even acknowledge it. She just gave me an empty cup and walked away. From what I had left in my latte it wasn't even good. I will definitely never ever come back here after this service. Horrible
