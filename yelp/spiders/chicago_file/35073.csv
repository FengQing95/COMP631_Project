Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Booked a reservation way in advance as we were coming in from Portland for a visit.  Happened to be St Pat's day (celebration, not actual date).  Unfortunately for us, the atmosphere (very clubby, old school speakeasy vibe) didn't match what was going on outside. I had no idea that St Pat's day in Chicago was like Mardi Gras without the stench. Not that timing had anything to do with the service / food.
