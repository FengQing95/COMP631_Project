Little Goat Diner////This spot is so cute. There is so much appeal to a diner that serves all food all day. My sister and I went in for a late lunch on Sunday and you could tell they were understaffed. We were told we would get a text when our table was ready and so we walked around. We never got our text and walked back to check in and our table was ready. The original host had left their shift so we never got notified. Our waitress had taken a while and prioritized tables who came after we were seated. I was disappointed in the service but giving four stars for the amazing food we were served. Absolutely would order both of these items again if we are back!
