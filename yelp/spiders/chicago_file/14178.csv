Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////the only downside was that the wait was still INCREDIBLY long. when we put our name down on the list, we were told it was a 35 minute wait...translation: 1 hour.  we even pre-ordered our pizza so that it would be ready by the time we got to our table, and it took an additional 1.5 hours for our pizza to get to us.  your best bet is to order take out and have it delivered...total delivery time: 1 hour.
