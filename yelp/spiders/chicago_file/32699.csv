Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My wife and I went here and ate in the lounge area near the front door.  It was a dark & stormy night and I drank a Dark & Stormy.  The cocktail was good - but not great, especially for the price.  It could have either been bigger or had less ice.  The steaks are just okay.  I had the Delmonico and I thought it was a little too "sinewy", if that is the word.  My wife had a salad and the size was okay but it was "nothing you couldn't get anywhere else".  I give the 4 stars because the food is a 3 but the atmosphere is a 5.  If you like going to a dark, swank, speakeasy style place with a good, noisy vibe then you will be in heaven.  The staff was okay - our waiter a little dramatic but not overly so - you need something for your slightly overpriced experience, no?  We also shared the thick cut bacon side as an appetizer.  It ways very tasty and fun.  You need to eat it quickly as it is best when it is hot (all though isn't all bacon better that way?).  This is a good place for a date night or anniversary with your significant other but probably not the best for a business dinner or a larger crowd if you want the whole table to interact.  If you have time stop in for a drink and decide for yourself.  If you just want a really great steak you can find better.  Cheers.
