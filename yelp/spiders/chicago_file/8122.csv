Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute has a fantastic verity of beautiful pieces and the galleries are wonderful, an absolute world class art museum. The Lichtenstein retrospective was awesome and well worth the wait. I wish I had more time in the museum and can't wait to go back, could have easily spent a couple days checking it out.
