Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////So it is with the deepest regret that I MUST write this update! Bavette's was my favorite restaurant in the city until my birthday dinner with my 5 girlfriends (4/21/15...first post was same exact day a few yrs ago). I visit this restaurant at least once a month (weekly when they first opened...lol) and I've never been disappointed! Service always impeccable, food always better than the last visit and the atmosphere always swanky!  I've celebrated major events, entertained clients and visiting guests, enjoyed several first dates....you get it...it's my ef'n fav restaurant...until this visit! (side bar...after recalling all the times I've been here...why doesn't anyone acknowledge that when I walk my ass through the door! lol...I'm just say'n)
