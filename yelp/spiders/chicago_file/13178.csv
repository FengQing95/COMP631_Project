Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When we first arrived at Lou's we decided to get the small Chicago classic pizza but the waiter said it would take 45 mins and recommended the pizza lunch which they could "bring right out" so we went with that because we had a Cubs game to get to. The lunch came with salad - we got the house dressing which was SO good. However 30 mins later we were wishing we would have gotten the classic afterall considering the wait. The pizza ended up being average. There seemed to be something off, I think the crust was undercooked because I could taste the yeast. Overall, I would go back for the salad but probably not the pizza.
