Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We were at the restaurant for an hour and had only received the vodka for my Bloody Mary and one of the four brunch tapas we had ordered. Especially since my friend was driving down to the south suburbs to see her family, the time crunch really started to hit us. My friend asked for the manager, who did a fantastic job handling the situation. She gave us an apology and very generous gift certificates for our next visit. Because I hadn't eaten yet, she even offered to give us some food to go (which we didn't take her up on due to our family obligations, so I can't review anything from their brunch menu). I have never been more impressed by a restaurant manager!
