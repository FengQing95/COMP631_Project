Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My favorite dish was the salmon and kale - again, juicy and flavorful, the kale was such a good pairing. If I remember correctly, it had a bit of a crunch (or at least wasn't soggy) and just awesome. A lot of pieces in each plate, too, so everyone had a good portion of fish on their plate.
