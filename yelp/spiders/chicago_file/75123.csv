Little Goat Diner////Their menu has changed as I was looking forward to trying other dishes that were no longer on the menu so be aware of a changing menu. Price wise I'll say it's fair. Not cheap but not overly overly priced I suppose. I probably wouldn't go here for lunch during work but as a nice treat for myself, I would. In an apparently growing/happening area of West Town, with multiple bars, restaurants and shops, Little Goat is worth checking out!
