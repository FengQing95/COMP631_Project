Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Okay, moving on. Â I enjoyed this place, it's a little (or a lot more) crowded than I would like and I think the 30 minute wait (even though we had a reservation) and the hostess calling your name over the speaker is pretty lame and commercial-y - but the food for the price is pretty awesome.
