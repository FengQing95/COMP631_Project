Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is my second time visiting this restaurant...the first time in 2019 my fianc√© and I were not impressed at all! Not much flavor to the sauce and it didn't seem like much of a deep dish because of how thin the pizza was. Fast forward to today we decided to give it another shot because of all the 5 star reviews and endless google searches of calling "Lou Malnati's #1"....still not impressed!! Service was especially lacking. We enjoyed the Buffalo wings more than the pizza! Definitely left disappointed and still hungry. Won't be back!
