Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Classic Chicago pizza! You will not find better. I love the taste, the crossed, the sauce - - everything about it. Also love their salads. I would definitely recommend getting one to go with the pie. Only thing I found lacking was our server. He seemed a bit overwhelmed by the crowd. Â  Never really got a order right
