Little Goat Diner////Nice environment, airy open ceiling, spacious seating with plenty of room between other parties. Friendly wait staff that were very attentive. Sandwiches are good sized portions for sharing. Brussels sprouts not very big if you intend to share. Moderate pricing. Would like to have a few more dessert options that were non ice cream. Overall above average diner food.
