Little Goat Diner////Breakfast observation:  LG is trying too hard to raise the gastronomic level of breakfast food.  I chose corned beef hash and eggs because there was one omelette on the menu.  There were numerous egg choices, however Kimchi and eggs (as an example) is not my first breakfast choice.  There were numerous pancake choices - not my cup of tea unless they're buckwheat (fat chance).  Heck, breakfast is breakfast!  Go to Meli or Yolk or Ina's (she has a parking lot and is just down Randolph).
