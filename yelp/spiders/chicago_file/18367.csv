Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is my favorite pizza place in the city (dining in, take out, or delivery). They cook everything to order so it's very delicious and ingredients seem really fresh. The service at the register (if taking out) could be more pleasant. The ladies always seems like they hate being there. Other than that, this is my go to place when anyone's in town and wants Chicago style pizza.
