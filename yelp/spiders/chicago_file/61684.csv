Smoque BBQ////We were there Saturday 1-28.  A busy and popular place.  I had the brisket, a link of sausage, mac and cheese, slaw, and the beans.  My partner had ordered a pulled pork sandwich, but wound up somehow with a brisket sandwich.  The brisket was good, the mac and cheese was very cheesy in a good way, the slaw was forgettable, and the beans were outstanding.
