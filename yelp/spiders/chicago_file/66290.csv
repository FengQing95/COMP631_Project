Little Goat Diner////I really can't find a reason to not give this place 5 stars.  I've been twice.  Not that I'm a die hard foodie or anything but I work a couple of blocks away and since I get off of work at 6:30am, I've taken full advantage of going when it opens in the mornings and it's still empty. It's like I've got the place all to myself.  I stopped in to the bread area a couple of weeks ago and got a few items which were excellent and very fresh. For breakfast this morning at the diner I had corned beef hash and eggs and it was pretty much perfect. My wife absolutely loved what she had although I can't remember now what it was.  The coffee is fantastic too! I love the decor of the place, they did a great job with that.  Also, they've managed to assemble one of the best front of the house staffs I've ever seen.  I'm sure the same can be said for the back of the house. Everyone is very friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. You can just feel the positive attitude when you walk in.  I really like the wait staff's uniforms, they're very classy. And kudos to Stephanie Izzard, I've seen her back in the kitchen working both times that I've gone to Girl and the Goat and also both trips to Little Goat. She must put in more hours in a week than I do in a month.
