Smoque BBQ////Food Network, Fellow Yelpers, and various media outlets definitely blew smoke for Smoque. The inside leaves something to be desired, I get it it's a hole in the wall, but after many years of success you would think you would fix the chipping paint on the wall of awards. The seating is very tight and awkward, there's a host to sit you, but it seems like they love to sit people in awkward places. I felt like many of the employees were encroaching on people's personal spaces and the service leaves something to be desired-it's very much "what do you want, ok, payment?, next" and you're just a number here. We came here today during lunch time and it wasn't very packed.
