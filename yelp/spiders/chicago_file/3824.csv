The Purple Pig////It was a Friday night and when we got there in the evening they informed us it was about a 1.5 hour wait. I was extremely sad because I was getting hungry, but we decided to just leave our reservation and go walk around for a drink and some appetizers somewhere else. SO happy we did that! They text me once our table was ready so we walked on over and got seated quickly.
