The Purple Pig////Having been multiple times, the food is consistently decadent and the service is always great. I've gotten the pork shoulder (extremely tender and well flavoured) and bone marrow (I think about this dish once every other day) each time I've gone to Purple Pig, as well as tried other different dishes with their wine pairings. Only complaint was that the last time I went, their entrance was locked and no one was there to quickly open it - which made trying to get in awkward and confusing.
