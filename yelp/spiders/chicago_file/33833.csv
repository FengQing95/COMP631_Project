Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place was very good. It was not worthy of a 1 month prior reservation. Very dark inside, which I liked. Made the ambience romantic. Crab/Avacado salad was our favorite. Tomato/Bacon salad was dull. We had a cheap item on the menu, the steak sandwich and that was delicious. Â Overall a good experience, probably not a destination, but I wouldn't hesitate to go back.
