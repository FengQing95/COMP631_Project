The Purple Pig////Service was also wonderful. We were seated right in front of the cook and the head chef was literally standing next to us. It was definitely a wonderful experience! There's still a lot of dishes we wanted to try, so we will definitely be back. In the meantime, I would recommend for you to try it out. Definitely worth the wait & the hype, and if you go a bit earlier like 5pm, you'll be seated pretty fast.
