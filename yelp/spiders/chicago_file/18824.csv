Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I came here several years ago per suggestion of a local while I was visiting. Compared to the other options for deep dish pizza this is probably the best. I am not a pizza fan. If I'm hungry its usuallly the last thing on my mind. But this isn't pizza. This is almost like an open faced calzone with buttery crust for days. Forget the calorie counter here!
