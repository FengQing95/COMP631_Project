Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I mean, there isn't much else to say about Lou's. They are a Chicago must. Giordano's and Gino's east think they have the best, and know they get all of the tourists, so in return you receive s@$* service. Lou's I always receive fantastic service. And not only is their pizza my second favorite in the city, but their salads are the serious sleeper here. Make sure you order a salad from them!
