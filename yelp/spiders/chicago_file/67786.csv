Little Goat Diner////Lastly, I would like to thank the rest of the staff at The Little Goat. From the moment we walked in, we were treated with great respect and felt very warm and welcome, before they even knew who we were. Then I told them who were were and the friendliness doubled. The flow of birthday wishes to Taylor was a gesture that I, myself, very much appreciate. Â
