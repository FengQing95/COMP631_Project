Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I enjoyed the deep dish at Lou Malnati's, but the seating and ordering process was a little chaotic. The crust was VERY buttery and had a nice crisp to it. The wait was around an hour and a half, but they do have the text message updates so we were able to wait in a juice shop nearby. Once seated, the pizza do take 45-50 minutes to cook. I think that's something important to know before choosing this restaurant! All that being said, I don't think any of that was a deal breaker! Our waiter was very kind, the food was great!
