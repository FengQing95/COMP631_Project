Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Being vegan, I wanted to let them know in advance since it is a steakhouse & that is probably their worst nightmare...their manager was so accommodating, they even made me a special sweet potato dish, in addition to letting me know of variety of other options. Oh, and a special printed menu! It's super sexy in there, great ambiance w/jazz in the background. We had such a wonderful meal here & the staff was excellent.
