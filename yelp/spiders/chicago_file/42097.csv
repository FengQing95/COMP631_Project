Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////By the end of our night out we shared 2 half pitchers of sangria (one raspberry and the other peach), enjoyed delicious foods that I normally wouldn't have tried, and again realized that maybe I should trust my BF a little bit more... he usually knows what he's talking about even though I hate to admit it! :) Â Can't let that stuff get to his head, right?!
