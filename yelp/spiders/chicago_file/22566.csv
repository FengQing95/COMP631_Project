Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Went to Chicago on a mini vacation and stopped by here the first night. I've never had a real Chicago deep dish so I was pretty excited. We ordered the Classic and The Lou. Took about 45 minutes for the food to come which is my only complaint but I knew that before going in, so not too bad. The classic was pretty good but The Lou was outstanding. Spinach mix, mushrooms, tomatoes, and 3 cheeses. I thought I wouldn't enjoy it because I'm not a big fan of mushrooms but it's not too noticeable and adds flavor to the pizza. Definitely going here again when I come back
