Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Can't believe I forgot to make a review for this place after my trip to Chicago! I must say--this place has the best deep dish pizza in Chicago. I went to three different deep dish pizza places, including this one, and I must say this one is the best. What's so memorable about this one is their amazing, crunchy crust, and I normally hate eating the crust of a pizza! The crust had a garlic-like seasoning of its own and the pizza sauce was just out of this world--it was definitely an awakening of the ilLOU-MALNATI (did they do that on purpose or it is mere coincidence?). The tomatoes were freshly chopped and oven-baked onto the deep dish pizza while the mozzarella cheese toppled all over this hearty and savory pizza pie.
