Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I think the highlight of the night for me was my cocktail (shocker, right?).  I had the lillet rosé martini and it was really good.  Second on the list was the décor.  The cozy vintage hideaway feeling makes me want to relax, order another drink, and enjoy the company (not necessarily in that order).
