Little Goat Diner////My friend Courtney brought me here because of their vegan menu that she loves. I am the opposite and this place offers the best of both worlds. The open diner feel was really nice, but there was something about it that made it feel more classy, I couldn't put my finger on it. The staff was attentive and they all had their own unique sense of style. I ordered the Goat burger which is goat burger, braised beef, bbq pork, pickled jalapenos, salsa verde, onion rings and cheddar. OMG. It was so much food, but it was so good, it just didn't need the tostada added to it. I didn't care if it was supposed to soak up all the juices from everything above, the burger was already the messiest thing ever. Lol. I would totally order it again. I also split an order of smoked fries with my friend. I left there stuffed. I'd totally come back here to try the rest of their menu!
