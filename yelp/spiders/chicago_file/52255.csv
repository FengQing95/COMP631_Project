Smoque BBQ////Smoque proves that just because something is profiled on Food Network, doesn't mean it's good. Or even adequate. Food Network jumped the shark on food integrity long ago. I'd estimate somewhere between The Next Food Network Star and Cupcake Wars. Thank God for Alton Brown - perhaps their only saving grace. Anyway - the food at Smoque was barely just ok. I'm no BBQ purist, but I will say I've been to numerous good AND crappy BBQ joints during my life, and Smoque would have trouble holding their own amidst the "crappy" category. Very sub-par for something featured on the Food Network.
