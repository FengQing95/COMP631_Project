Smoque BBQ////Everything here is amazingly delicious.   The fries are so good I couldn't stop eating them and I'm not a big fan of fries.  The ribs are cooked perfectly and the rub they use is excellent.  But what makes the place also great is their customer service.  The guys that seat you are vey helpful and very polite.  They make sure that you have everything you need and they even open the doors for you.  The place always had a line that seemed to be endless, but you don't have a very long wait.  You won't be disappointed!
