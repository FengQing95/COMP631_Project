Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza was super oily, dripping in butter. The crust was a bit cooked enough, but still was a bit too doughy for my taste. It was definitely like a pie crust, with cheese, tomato sauce, sausage, and other stuff thrown inside. I did love the fact that there was so much stuff in it... it was almost like a lasagna.
