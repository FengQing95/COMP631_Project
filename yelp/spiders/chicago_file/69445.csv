Little Goat Diner////The service was a bit on the slow side. We came here on a Friday, waited 45 minutes (just went to a bar and they texted us when the table was available), and we waited about 15 minutes for our food to come to the table. Again, this was day 2 of the opening so I'm assuming they were working out kinks.
