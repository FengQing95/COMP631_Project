The Purple Pig////Besides the food, our waiter was so friendly and nice. He actually went back to see if the quinoa that comes with the salmon could be made without bacon, he then recommended subs for us since it couldn't. Honestly, I loved the service here, the atmosphere, and the food itself was just amazing.
