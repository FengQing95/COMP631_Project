Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I'm not fond of pancakes, but I would have pancakes again at this place. I liked it. It's so fluffy. I had the signature omelette and upgraded the pancakes to tiramisu pancakes for $1. Definitely go for the upgrade; it's very worth it. I like that they had cream on the top of the bottom pancake so it was oozing when I cut it. The hash brown was crisp. Perfect. Portions are huge. Very worth it. Arrive before 8:00am on a weekend to avoid the wait.
