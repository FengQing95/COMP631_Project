Art Institute of Chicago////even with two kids with us, we had a good time and we saw so many things.  Spending 6 hours with two-ten year olds speaks volume of the interest that can be stimulated here.  The paintings were great.  So fun to see the originals.  However, the armor exhibits as well as the ancient greece items kept everyone's attention.
