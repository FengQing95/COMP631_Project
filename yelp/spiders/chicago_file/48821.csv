Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba twice and generally find it a safe and pleasant option, especially when in a pinch. The food is pretty good (nothing I've ever had is worse than "average"), the space is enormous, ensuring a minimal wait time even on a Friday, and the menu is vast enough to accommodate a wide array of tastes. Even their drinks are not overly sweet or watered down- solid all around!
