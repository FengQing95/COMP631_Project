Little Goat Diner////We showed up on a Saturday at noon. That was a mistake, it was an hour and fifteen minute wait! It was worth it, though. I got the little goat latte- with goat milk and whipped cream. I was immediately interested. The menu had a ton of interesting and different creations- i wanted to try everything.
