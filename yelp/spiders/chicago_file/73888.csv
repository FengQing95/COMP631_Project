Little Goat Diner////I had planned out my dining choices in advance, and ordered the Asian Breakfast Tasty Thingy and the blueberry goat cheese pie. I loved the Asian thingy, as expected; it messily combined all my favorite ingredients...kimchi, eggs, bacon, sprouts, and savory pancake topped w. lots of Sriracha and asian-style dipping sauce. Â The pie serving was not a typical slice, but a wonderful, miniaturized not-too-sweet blueberry pie topped with the perfect complement of goat cheese gelato. Halfway through the meal, I noticed David Schwimmer enjoying a fruit bowl incognito at a nearby booth. Any minor celebrity-related stupor was quickly replaced by mild outrage..."Just a fruit bowl David? At Little Goat? Really?". Service was good and not intrusive, respectful of a single diner, her suitcase, and her poor attempts to stay cool and avoid ogling Schwimmer.
