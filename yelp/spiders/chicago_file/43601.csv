Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I don't understand why everyone loves Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba so much.  Having lived in Spain, I can say with certainty that something was lost in translation when putting together the tapas menu.  The food isn't bad, which is why a lot of Chicago-ans claim to love the place, but it just seems very contrived and un-authentic (I guess after all it is a part of a huge chain of Lettuce Entertain You restaurants).  And the service is not up to par...I had a reservation and made plans around dinner, but ended up having to wait almost an hour for a seat (it was a party of 2...it's not that hard to scrounge up a table for JUST 2 PEOPLE, especially if I had reservations).
