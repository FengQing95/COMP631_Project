Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I somehow managed to squeeze in a tiny crevice of space in my stomach to finish off with some of Bavette's ice cream ($8). We went with the chocolate and added the complimentary magicbrick. I don't know how we did it (probably because it was wonderful), but we managed to clean up nearly the whole dessert! Loved adding the shell on top and chipping away at the chocolate candy topping.
