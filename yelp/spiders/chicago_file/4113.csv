The Purple Pig////Snagged a seat at the bar as a walk-in. Purple Pig is crowded for good reason! Tapas style so probably around 6-8 dishes for 4 people gets you satisfied. Razor clams and crispy chicken Skin were my personal favorites. Drinks are well made and strong. Would come back but definitely make a reservation beforehand.
