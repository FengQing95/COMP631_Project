The Purple Pig////Jake served our table needs nicely. My total bill exclusive of gratuities was $108. We both enjoyed our lunch and service. As a result I returned here a second time with my larger family party of four, which was just as enjoyable as my first visit. I will definitely return here again for lunch. This review is mostly based on my first visit, but, I was just as satisfied with my second family of four visit for lunch.
