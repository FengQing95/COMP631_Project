Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Prompt and friendly service, plan your time accordingly if you're dining in. In this tourist's opinion between Malnati's and Giordano's, Malnati's wins. The crust is more flavorful and I think has a better texture - and less dry. Don't get me wrong, that stuffed pizza is good but if I had to choose between the two - BUTTERY CRUST #ftw
