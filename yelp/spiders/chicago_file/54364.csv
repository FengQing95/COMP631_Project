Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I attended a Bridal Shower here at 11am last Sun morning.  The place was still fairly empty with guests scattered about in all different areas of the restaurant for breakfast/brunch/sangria.  I love the building itself.  There are all these different seating areas and hallways, brick and dark and intimate.  Nice outdoor dining area also.
