Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////To me this is kind of an odd place. I like the idea of breakfast/brunch but I guess the idea of going into a corporate building seems weird. Once inside, its familiar and nice. There are couples having a friendly lunch or business types moaning about their bosses and in general the setting was a good mix of people from Michigan Ave. tourists to Prudential Tower employees. I came for the food and I wasn't disappointed. The southern eggs Benedict was outstanding. The hash browns were excellent and the service was great. I had a large orange juice which was really good as well and I am putting this place on my short list of breakfast spots in the loop to stop in at regularly.
