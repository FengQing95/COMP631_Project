Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Got it uncut and even though I picked it up and walked back to my hotel, it remained warm and super crispy. Ridiculously delicious! If I lived in Chicago I'm sure I would try a million other places but I'm a New Yorker living in California and in going to say this place is super LEGIT!
