Little Goat Diner////The service was fantastic and hence the two stars but other than that, I have nothing nice to say about Little Goat. Â Should I blame my expectations? Maybe! If people talk a place up so much and you wait 1 plus hour to be seated then yes my food better be kick ass. The coffee was awful, unreasonably strong and completely undrinkable. The food was so salty I couldn't even touch the potatoes. I had the corned beef hash and my husband had a Spanish omelette or something like it. His was semi okay but mine was awful. They had slapped slices of corned beef in my plate with crappy salty potatoes. They did get my eggs right but then again if you mess that up you shouldn't be in business. I am not so sure I plan on returning.
