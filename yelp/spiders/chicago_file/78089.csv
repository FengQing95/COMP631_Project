Little Goat Diner////Service was pretty attentive and the interior is super cute, as is the giant little (oxymoron, anybody?) rotating goat on the roof of the establishment. I'm very glad we got the chance to come here and would come back here in a heartbeat if I happened to find myself in Chicago ago.
