Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pizza was delicious, as it always is. I think Lou's deep dish has just the right amount of cheese. Other places serve deep dish with extremely thin crust and a pie full of cheese, Lou's crust is just a little bit thicker, which evens out the ratio of cheese to dough in every bite. I Â also really like Lou's sauce. And their "Lou's salad" is wonderful.
