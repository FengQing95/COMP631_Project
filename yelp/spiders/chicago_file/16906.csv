Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is a never disappointing place to eat. I went to lunch there and had their lunch special; salad, drink, and personal deep dish. It was great. I love that I can go there during my lunch break at work and still have a deep dish freshly made. This is an iconic pizzeria in Chicago and if you have never had it please do yourself a favor and treat yourself to a Lou Malnatis deep dish. The buttery crust, melted mozzarella and fresh toppings will delight you. I have never been to a Lou Malnatis location that had bad staff. I always come out of there feeling happy.
