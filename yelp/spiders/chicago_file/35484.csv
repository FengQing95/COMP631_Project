Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Desserts are indulgent - do not expect petit fours here.  It's large servings of cheesecake or meringue pie.  If you like to people watch, ask to sit upstairs. If you prefer a quieter, tucked away experience, ask to sit downstairs in what feels like a speakeasy living room (they have a full bar downstairs and you can get their full menu too).
