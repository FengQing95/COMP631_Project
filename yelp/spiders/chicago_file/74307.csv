Little Goat Diner////The call is the Goat but it's not the greatest of all time. It's nothing crazy. I would be willing to try the breakfast there but the dinner wasn't worth waiting. We had the rueben, los drowned, and fried pickes/onions. I was trying to gauge the room for what other people were eating and it seemed very balance. I guess i understand why people enjoy the variety but for me the quality wasn't there. Service and ambience were great, but cooking and cocktails were underwhelming.
