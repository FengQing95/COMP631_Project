Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Conclusion:  Deep dish pizza - yummy.  Lou's was the best of the bunch.  The crust was perfectly crunchy, the dough had the best mouth-feel, the whole-pizza sausage patty well-seasoned, the cheese had wonderful texture, and the toppings are a good amount.  They store your order info under your phone #, so it's easy to tell them you want your usual - deluxe whole sausage, add pepperoni, butter crust, uncut.  Can't go wrong there.
