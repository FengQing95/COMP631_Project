The Purple Pig////Pigs Ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers & fried egg - the most yummy thing we got. Break the egg, mix in the oozing runny yolk, then the softness of the egg blends perfectly with the crispyness of kale and pigs ear. The salty ear and the pickled peppers also compliment each other.
