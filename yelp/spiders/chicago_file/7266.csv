Art Institute of Chicago////Terrible service! The worst service I ever received in my entire life. I went in purchased two tickets. As I wanted to enter, the security told me that I need to drop my backpack and coat. According to their rule, people cannot enter the museum with their coat or bag. I went to drop my backpack and coat, there was a lady and she said I need to pay $1 for dropping my backpack. It is silly in my opinion because if I have to pay $1, then why don't you guys just add that $1 on the ticket? I usually don't carry cash. I wanted to pay by credit card, but they said it can only be paid by cash. I understand all of these things. I was ok with all and I did not have any complain. But the women that was getting the coat and backpack was very rude in the way she was talking to me. I gave $1, and gave my backpack. I asked if I must drop my coat, as well. She said yes, and asked for $1 for each coat. I said ok. I needed to get my cell phone from my backpack. I said "can I get my backpack, please? I forgot something." The lady was too rude, and she did not respond me. I said again louder, I said "Can I get my backpack please?" And she said "No, you can't. I need to help someone else. Wait!" She helped the next person although it was my turn!!!!! I waited in line!!!! At this point I got really upset. I was a tourist, I was a costumer, I was polite to the lady and she must have been polite to me in return!! She never come back to give my backpack, she sent someone else after a few minutes.. And I asked the second lady, what was the name of the other rude lady. And she said she can't tell her name to me. WHY DON'T THEY PUT A NAME TAG? I said I want to talk to a manager. She said they don't have a manager, manager is not reachable and lots of other lies. I told my mom to stay there. I went to security people and asked for manager, he called manager and I talked to the manager on the phone. I told to manager about the rude behavior of the lady, and I said that "I don't trust that lady anymore to leave my backpack there, I haven't used the tickets, I want to return the tickets and leave the museum". She was a nice manager, she came and talk to me. The manager was very polite, she let me return the ticket and get refund. I got my backpack and coat and left.. I hated that place and rudeness of that staff. Terrible! Terrible!
