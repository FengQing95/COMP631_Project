Little Goat Diner////I was excited to try Stephanie Izard's restaurant and was quite impressed with their brunch. Reservations are recommended as the place does look like it gets pretty packed during prime hours. The menu is extensive with a ton of delectable offerings. Do yourself a favor though and order the hash browns, as they are life changing! A hint on the salty side, but I can easily say it's the best I've ever had in my life.
