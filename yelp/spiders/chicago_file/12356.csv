Art Institute of Chicago////Bring your headphones for the audio tour! I remember them giving us a listening device on my previous visit, but now the audio tour is only available via their app, and you need your own headphones. They're doing okay with COVID precautions. Masks are required, the cafe is shut down, and they remind you to social distance, but that is not possible in the special exhibit due to the amount of people in that space.
