Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Unrivaled tapas spot in Chicago. While I don't think that there are many competitors, I challenge anyone to find better tapas in Chicago. Unfortunately, no one can, so the wait here is ludicrous or you just shouldn't try. I went to Babareeba last Friday with a group of seven. We weren't able to arrange for reservations ahead of time, and decided to put our names in. My friend first put our name in at 7:15Pm. We weren't seated until after 9Pm. With reservations, the wait isn't usually this long...I'm just giving fair warning.
