Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It's definitely better to have it made-to-order vs. the pre-made personal size pizzas, but it does take a while to come out. Their sausage is my favorite topping, and I think the sauce is about as good as it gets. I like the thickness of the crust, but it would be better if they actually filled the deep dish pizza pan. I'm not complaining about the amount of food, I'm just saying it looks skimpy.
