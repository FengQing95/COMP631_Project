Little Goat Diner////One wonders why the entrance walls, but then again, if you come here to eat on a weekend noonish it makes perfect sense, because plenty of other hungry brunchers stand in line with you and if it happens to be cold outside they won't stand "in line" but "in crowd" (a heard of little goats?), anyways, you are protected by the cushioned walls from being squeezed against a cold, hard surface. But luckily, alternatively, you can leave the counter people your cell phone number and go for a walk, which is nice, as the wait might be longer than 20 minutes.
