Little Goat Diner////Went to dinner last Sunday night with my family. We have eaten at  Girl & the Goat and love it.  I'm not sure if there was a different chef or a chef in training but the food was not very good.  My son and I had the goat burger and it was undercooked and the pulled pork and the onion rings were very acidic.  My husband complained that his meal was also acidic.  My younger son had the fried chicken which was good and my other son had the fat Elvis waffle which was ok.  He didn't like that it got so soggy because the syrup was on it when it came out.  Unfortunately this was not the worst part of the experience.  My youngest son had left his Bulls hat which he got at a game he attended a couple of weeks before.  I called the next morning and spoke with one of the managers who said she had the hat in the office with her.  I let her know that we would be by in an hour to pick it up.  When we got there the hat was gone.  No one knew where it was.  How does that happen?  It really makes me question the integrity of the staff that Little Goat employs.  The manager gave us a $20 gift card and a little goat hat.  Thanks but no thanks.  I had a 7 year old in tears and had to go out and spend another $35 on a Bulls hat!  I called back on Wednesday to see if the hat had shown up.  Spoke with another woman in the office who said she would talk to the management and get back to me by the end of the day.  Still waiting for that phone call.  Needless to say, we will not be returning to Little Goat and I will be sharing this story with everyone I know that is headed to that area to eat.
