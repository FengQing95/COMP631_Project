Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I begged to place the order before he got there so it could be ready in a relatively reasonable time after he arrived. Â They supposedly put in the order. However, after he finally showed and after we sat down, we STILL waited another 50 minutes for the "famous" Lou's pizza to come out.
