Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I came here with high expectations. When I walk into a restaurant, I feel like everything on the menu should be reflective of your skill, not just what you specialize. After all, if you only specialize in one thing and everything else isn't that good, why waste the money to keep making the other things. I came with a large group and most ordered the pizza. But the sight of "homemade sauces made daily" peaked my interest so I got the spaghetti. It came to the table with lovely presentation, however, it appears that someone's idea of making a meat sauce is simply taking your marinara, tossing it with some cooked ground beef, and calling it a day. The meat certainly wasn't simmered in the sauce and when I tried my friends pizza, I noted the similarities in taste. The sauce did not stick to the pasta and it came out somewhat lukewarm. No cheese on top.
