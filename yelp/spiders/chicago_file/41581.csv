Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is one of my favorite places to go for tapas in the city. I have never ordered a dish that I didn't like (don't forget about dessert!). Be prepared to wait for a table on the weekend, but we usually find a place to sit in the bar and enjoy the sangria in the meantime, so it has never been much of a problem. And I appreciate that they don't rush you through your meal, encouraging you to keep ordering -- makes it worth the wait.
