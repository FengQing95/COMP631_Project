Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Looked this up on my handy Yelp app and decided to try it out on our last morning in Chicago. Took the train and walked a couple of blocks south Wildberry which is in the first floor of the Prudential building if I'm not mistaken. Easy to find and we had no wait at around 8:30 on a weekday. It was busy but not packed.
