Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I don't know what these people are thinking! Had one of the named special Lou pizzas I think and it was just bland and blah and un appetizing. Wow disappointed since people say this is chicago best. I'd rather eat a frozen pizza. Yea I said it. Go somewhere else and try and find something with flavor
