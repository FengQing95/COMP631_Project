Little Goat Diner////Great setting, marginal service, mix-mash of foods that really didn't sound that appealing.  We'll go back to try breakfast, but for lunch or dinner, not again.  A perfect example of a restaurant living on the hype of its overextended one-time-wonder chef.  We loved her at Scylla, but not since.
