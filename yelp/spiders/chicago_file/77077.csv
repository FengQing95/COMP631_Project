Little Goat Diner////Food was delish. We arrived around 9:30 and was able to sit right away at the counter (true diner experience) place is lovely, and food exceptional.  Smoked corn beef hash and eggs was perfect.  The burrito was exceptional too. Just when you wonder why something is on the plate it makes sense.  Flavor was hearty, savory and refreshing. It's a lot of food so go hungry.
