Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I heard really good things about this place, so I was excited to try it. However, my experience was much worse than I expected. I went with my friend during the week and we sat at the bar for drinks and tapas. We started with the sangria the the pintxo platter, which was free with the foursquare check in for first time guests. It took almost 20 minutes to get our drinks, and the place wasn't even busy. When we were ready to order more, the bartender was oblivious and had forgotten all about us. After about 15 more minutes, he finally returned and we ordered the cheese plate and the spicy potatoes.
