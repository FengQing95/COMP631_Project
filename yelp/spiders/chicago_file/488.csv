Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Met up with a friend here on a Friday morning around 10:30 or 11. This place was absolutely jam packed and for good reason. Food is really yummy. We waited at least 40 minutes to be seated and the atmosphere is a bit hectic. On the up side, our server was on it. We didn't wait long for anything even though it was clear she was working hard. My friend ordered fresh juice and the Cinnamon Roll French Toast. She had been there before and raved about both. I ordered the Rutherford Omelet with spinach, caramelized onions, goat cheese and bacon. This was seriously the best omelet I've ever had! So GOOD! If you can handle waiting and a bit of noise this place is fantastic.
