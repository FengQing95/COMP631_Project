Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is a sophisticated streak house with an al-la-carte menu similar to Ruth Chris but with far more ambience. I had the petit filet that was grilled to perfection. It only arrives with a grilled tomato, so we ordered sides of veggie. My family also order the beef stroganoff, a better deal that was extremely good. We shared a crab cake as an appetizer and it was fresh and delicious. If you're not fond of dark restaurants, this place may not work for you. I would anticipate about $100.00 per person for an average order, so this is quite pricey.
