Little Goat Diner////The food can range from okay to great, so it's worth asking your server for advice. Having grown up eating a variety of Asian food, I am at once excited to see certain Asian cuisine and ingredients incorporated into the menu, yet mostly disappointed with the execution. Most everything else is quite tasty though. And I am a big fan of the Elvis Waffles.
