Little Goat Diner////I was just in the neighborhood at 3pm, not even meal time, but this place was so inviting that I decided to pop in. It has a bright and relaxing brunch place feel with giant windows. I ordered the pork belly pancake. The food was creative and the pork belly was delicious. I thought the pancake itself is too buttery and salty. I love Asian scallion pancakes and also western fluffy pancakes, but this pancake is an awkward middle ground that is not entirely pleasing. The music was also way too loud there. My overall experience was fine, probably because I didn't have to wait a second for the table. I would not wait long for a table there though, especially given the amount of options around.
