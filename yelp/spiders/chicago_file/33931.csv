Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We ate there, sitting at the bar, on Sunday night. The bar was slow yet, somehow, the service was terrible. We got the impression that the bartender had friends sitting at the bar with whom she was more interested in talking to, rather than take care of the other customers. The food was good. But not good enough to deal with that type of substandard service.
