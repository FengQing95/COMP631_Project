Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Being born right outside Chicago, I've tried all different kinds of deep dish pizza and Lou Malnati's is hands down my favorite. I am not giving 4 stars because the thin crust is good, but nothing special compared to some mom and pop shops pizza I have had before. I went to this Lou's for an early dinner last night and the service was excellent. We were seated right away on the outside patio and the waitress was there moments later to take our order. Our waitress was extremely friendly and checked in often but not to the point where it was annoying. Lou's is where I will always take out of town friends to experience, in my opinion, the best deep dish in the city!
