Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Wildberry looks like a really small place from the outside but it is actually quite spacious and nicely decorated.  The staff is very friendly and one of the most efficient I have seen in a while.  They did a great job of telling us how long we would wait and they were right on time with our seating.  The staff also is very knowledgeable about the menu.  Our waiter was able to quickly tell us what each dish was and how it was prepared.
