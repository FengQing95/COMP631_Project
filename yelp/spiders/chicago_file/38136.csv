Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////One of our all time favorite spots. Flew from Boston for a little getaway and this was on our must do list. I was slightly hesitant that the experience wouldn't be as good as our first visit but it did not disappoint. Delicious food and drinks, fantastic atmosphere and superb service. Thanks for another great night!
