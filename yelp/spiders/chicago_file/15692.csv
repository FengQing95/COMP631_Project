Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I eat two pieces but I've seen college boys pack away five (which is definitely unhealthy. As a dessert lover I have to say that probably the highlight of Lou's for me is the chocolate chip pizza, which is really a chocolate chip cookie baked in a little cast iron pan so that the edges are delightfully crispy and the inside is melty/gooey, and topped with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. It is AMAZING.
