Little Goat Diner////I ordered 1) This Little Piggy Went to China and then 2) Kimchee & Bacon & Eggs & Pancakes Asian Style Breakfast Tasty Thing. It's like someone dug deep into my brain and found the venn diagram that includes breakfast, Asian-inspired food, and savory dishes.. Both were so unique, exciting, and delicious. My favorite of the two would be the This Little Piggy... it's a renegade of intense Asian flavors (sesame, chili garlic chive sauce, Szechuan pork sausage) all topped with a runny egg and a SUPER delicious biscuit. The blackberries are a weird but delicious addition that tie the whole dish together.
