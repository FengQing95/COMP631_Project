Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was the first place I had deep dish at when I moved to Chicago a few years ago. Expect to wait about 45 minutes to receive the pizza after ordering (this is pretty standard at all deep dish places). The pizza itself is pretty heavy, more so than most of the other deep dish places I've eaten at in Chicago. The crust doesn't particularly have much flavor despite ordering the buttercrust, the sauce is a big on the sour side, and the sausage tends to be pretty bland.
