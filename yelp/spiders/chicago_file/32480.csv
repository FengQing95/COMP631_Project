Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So I was forewarning about deep dish pizza not being so great, but I still wanted to give it a try. I ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic deep dish pizza in personal size, and honesty... I was not impressed. The pizza tasted a bit bland. Tomato sauce tasted very watery. The crust was probably the best part with fluffy breading and crispy edges. Nothing I would want to try again.
