Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tapas we enjoyed: Brussels sprouts, stuffed mushrooms, short rib, octopus, shrimp, moorish chicken, and pork belly paella. And of course a pitcher of black raspberry sangria (a little too sweet but still good). The octopus, never my go-to dish, was so delicious! Glad we expanded our horizons :)
