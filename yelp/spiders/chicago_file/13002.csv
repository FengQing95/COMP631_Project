Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We have this for lunch every wednesday so I eat it but really not a fan.  So as with all my ratings 2 stars=I'd only eat it if someone else is paying.  3 if I'm in the area.  4 I will actively go out of  my way to eat here.  And to always give an alternative.  Go to pequods I think their deep dish in so much better.
