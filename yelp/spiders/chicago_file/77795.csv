Little Goat Diner////I thought I was hungry, but I was beyond stuffed with just my meal.  Wowza!  My fella ordered this interesting Asian dish that had crunchies and some spicy mayo drizzled over it.  Naturally, I can't find it on the online menu today.  He liked it, and the side of bacon from nearby Publican Quality Meats.  The mimosas were a bit small for the $10 price tag, but I think it comes with the territory.
