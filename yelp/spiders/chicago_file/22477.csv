Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I am convinced, absolutely convinced, that this is the best pizza in the country. Nothing compares on either coast. I've had every pizzeria in Seattle and while some are pretty damn good, none are in Lou Malnati's tier. I've spent some time in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, pretty much all up and down the East Coast. New York's large fold able slices have nothing on rich thick deep dish. That fennel sausage at Lou's is just to die for.
