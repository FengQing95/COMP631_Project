The Purple Pig////We started with the whipped feta and toast. The feta was topped with cucumbers and saut√©ed tomatoes and the toast was super buttery and flavorful. Next, we tried the broccoli, which our server said was the "best broccoli we'd ever have." It was really good - dressed in a Caesar-like sauce and sprinkled with breadcrumbs. The favorite of some of our party was the pork belly - if you're a meat eater, you should order the pork belly! Another hit was the ricotta gnocchi - topped with pork "gravy." The gravy was more like a red pork sauce. This was the most light and fluffy gnocchi I've ever had (our server said, unlike most gnocchi, it was made with 80% ricotta and 20% wheat). We also tried the whipped chickpea spread that was served with toasted focaccia. The bread was very similar to the toast served with the whipped feta dish.
