Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were back home in Chicago and ordered delivery from here. They didn't send any red pepper or parmesan which officially makes them the WORST. PIZZA. IN. CHICAGO. Seriously, who sends a pizza with nothing else? We had to call to get them to send it and our pizza was cold by the time it arrived.
