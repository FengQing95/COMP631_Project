Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was a tough review for me to figure out! First of all, I have a huge and unwavering love for NY thin crust pizza, but I promised myself to have an open mind for this. We got there around 9:30 on a Sunday night, and MAN, was it packed. We were told it'd be a 45-minute wait, so we tried to do carry out instead. We were told it'd be 50 minutes to wait for that, so we stuck to that plan. Well, after about 15 minutes, everyone had been seated and we regretted that choice! The staff was not very helpful and that whole process was kind of frustrating. We finally got our pizza, and it was really good! It was delicious and fresh. I just wish it was easier to get!
