Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Best Experience from walking in to walking out on a Wednesday evening beginning at 5 p.m and ending at 8 p.m. Had been there for awhile waiting for a friend but was happily seated by the friendlist and helpful hostest and ordered myself a recommendation of 'Blood Orange Sangria' after my waitress approached me so kindly. Feeling like I was sitting in Spain, during the summer time as it is freezing in Chicago, I enjoyed the ambiance of light chatter as people were coming in to dine and ordering their favorites from the menu.
