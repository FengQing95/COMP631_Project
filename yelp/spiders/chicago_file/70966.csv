Little Goat Diner////So yummy!! Came here on a whim while in the city and was blown away! I had the goat latte and this little piggy went to china for breakfast and loved most. Would really recommend the this little piggy because it had the best sausage and biscuit i've had. Don't be scared of the goat milk in the goat latte- it was one of the best lattes i've ever had. Hope to be returning soon!
