Smoque BBQ////I've been coming to Smoque for years, primarily for the brisket, and the last two times (this past Tuesday, and about a month before that as well) it has really been off.  Someone else commented that the brisket has been "pot-roastey", and that's spot on.  This past Tuesday I ordered one pound of brisket, and the majority of the slices were grey with little-to-no smoke ring.  The slices were also mushy and fatty, with almost no smoke flavor...and the bark, well it really wasn't bark.
