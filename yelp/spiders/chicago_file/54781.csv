Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I can't praise this place enough.. this is the first restaurant I ever tried after moving to Chicago and have been here many times and now again last night.. Totally loved every single item yet again.. I tried baked goat cheese, roasted chicken empanadas, spiced potatoes, ate freaking octopus despite not being a fan of seafood, bacon wrapped dates and dessert.. Loved every single item..  Can't believe I never wrote a review which is past due.. Will visit again. I've tried almost all of the vegetarian  items in the past and chicken curry salad which were all super delicious..
