Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////When you first come in it feels like you kind of hit a time warp and are transformed back to the 80s. Very traditional look and feel for an upscale steakhouse. I didn't see the upstairs but the second story is supposed to be a bit more modern in look and feel. It was packed the night I stopped in but luckily snagged a few chairs at the car and ate what I consider one of the best chickens I have had pretty much ever. I know, chicken sat a steakhouse... but I had just had fish and someone else shared some prime rib which was life changing. The Chicago fit steakhouse was basically perfect in taste Ã±, temp and presentations. The sides are huge and definitely shareable. The potatoes and asparagus were phenomenal but he Mac and cheese was out of this world. Can't say enough good things about them definitely worth trying if your in town but get reservations early.
