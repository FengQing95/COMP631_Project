Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Came to Bavettes for our anniversary dinner. Originally we were suppose to come the night of game 7 of the Cubs World Series and they graciously rescheduled us to another evening. Probably why I gave them 4 stars instead of 3. Love the atmosphere!!! We ordered the crab stuffed avocado salad. Was really good but I would have preferred less of the vingarette. If I order again I would request dressing on the side.. I had the short rib stroganoff which was fantastic and moderately priced! My husband had the 6 oz filet. I tried it and I can't say it was anything special. We also ordered their famous elote corn which I didn't care for. The restaurant was super busy on a Wednesday night. My husband ordered another cocktail while we were eating our appetizer and it didn't arrive until we were finishing our entrees. The waiter was very knowledgeable but he only stopped in 2-3 times. Overall I expected more based on the reviews.
