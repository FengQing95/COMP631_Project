Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Right next to the Millennium park so this is a touristy place. Los Altos Benedict was the only descent food out of everything we ordered here. Coffee was terrible. If you are a Chicagoan, you have so many better brunch options all over the city. Over Easy Cafe, Batter & Berries, and Original Pancake House to name a few. However, I understand that the restaurant is conveniently located right next to many tourist attractions in Chicago.
