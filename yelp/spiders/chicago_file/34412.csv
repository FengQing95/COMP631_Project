Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I was and still am very conflicted because the food (with exception of the garlic shrimp appetizer -- good sauce and brad, really overcooked shrimp) was great. The stroganoff was comforting comfort food and hubby said that his 24 oz rib eye was the best steak he's ever had. But "meh I've experienced better" sums it up for me because I have had exponentially better experiences ... at Maude's, Au Cheval and Gilt.
