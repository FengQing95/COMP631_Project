Little Goat Diner////This lil' Goat is rarely on my mind because I forget that it's nearby.  But I was treated to this lil' diner yesterday during the great blizzard of 2014.  It was my first time and my favorite Jew took me to congratulate me on my AVP promotion.  I've heard about lil' Goat for a while and I still have yet to dine across the street at it's big sister eatery.
