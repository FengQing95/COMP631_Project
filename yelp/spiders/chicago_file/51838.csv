Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We stumbled upon this place on Yelp while visiting on business from NY and it completely lived up to the reviews. The food was amazing and the service was awesome ! I recommend siting on the patio but it gets a bit chilly. We had a bunch of tapas and then the vegetable paella which was great but HUGE.
