Little Goat Diner////I love every component in bullseye French toast separately but I wasn't sure if it would all be good together. I really had no reason to worry because it was amazing. Brioche with a soft egg in the middle was prime and the honey fried chicken worked well with the sweetness of the toast and berries. Definitely my favorite dish. This little piggy went to China had a good Szechuan taste but may not be for those who aren't used to the numbing spice. The fatoush salad was surprisingly good and had a strong presence. The pork belly home fries came with a great aioli but is skippable. I also had bites of the dark chocolate pancakes, bacon, and hash browns and I was very happy with all of them. I wish I lived in Chicago so that I could come back and try the other dishes since they have an expansive menu.
