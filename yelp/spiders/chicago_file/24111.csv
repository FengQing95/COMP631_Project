Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Really really really amazing pizza. First trip to Chicago and I didn't know whether to try Lou's or Gios I was told by several friends that Lous was the way to go and I'm so glad I listened. The service was outstanding and so was the pizza. We couldn't decide between The "Lou" or the sausage and our server suggested we do the half and half to get some of both!! Genius and so great because my husband wanted the sausage and I wanted the Lou! They tell you it'll be 35 minutes for pizza but I think it was out in about 20 (we were there for lunch). Until my next trip to chi town I'll be dreaming of this pie!!
