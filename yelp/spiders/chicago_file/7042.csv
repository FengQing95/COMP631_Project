Art Institute of Chicago////The layout of this museum (different wings of the building that only connect on certain floors especially) and the lack of helpful signage really spoiled my enjoyment of this museum.  I had a heck of a time just trying to find a restroom at one point , let alone the Modern Art collection that was my primary interest.  I've been an "art nut" all my life and have visited art museums all over the world.  I have a good sense of direction but this place left me angry and frustrated (at all the time that I wasting looking for things when I could have been enjoying the art.) Visiting this museum is expensive and I was there for about 8 hours and left feeling like I'd been "taken".
