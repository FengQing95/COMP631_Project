The Purple Pig////It was the entrees that left me feel a bit disappointed. It just didn't quite fit my taste buds. With that said... the crispy pig ears is a must-try. It's certainly crispy! Definitely do not expect this dish to fill you up though. The Spanish octopus was a bit disappointing - there was a fishy odor to it that made me not like it. The pork ribs is a bit salty for my taste but the sauce is quite zesty and each bite melts in your mouth.
