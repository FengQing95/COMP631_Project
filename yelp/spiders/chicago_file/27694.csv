Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First deep dish pizza experience in Chicago didn't disappoint. We order a personal pepperoni and a personal sausage along with a salad. They delivered to our hotel- however it took a while. Once it arrived it was hot and tasted great. Their house dressing for their salad was one of the best tasting Â vinaigrettes I've ever had.
