Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place has to be good...one of the waitier says its like 3 months out for a reservation. Wow so my husband and i decided to go as soon as they open on a Sunday at 5pm. The food is great my husband steak was. The bomb and he's a Morton's person. My 2 margaritas we great. My chicken and his steak was cooked the way he wanted with is a plus. I love the light it s kind of dark. Its not that loud which is a big plus for me. The waitress was really great i Â her name is Amy she was awesome very a nice..great personality....we will be returning...
