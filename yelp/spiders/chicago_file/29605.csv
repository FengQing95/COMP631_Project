Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So this was recommended by several people for my first try of a Chicago style pizza and boy did it not disappoint! I had a personal Malnati Chicago Classic (with mushrooms added). The sausage on it was some of the best I've ever had and the garlic butter crust was divine. Everything was super fresh. As a pizza lover, I'm sad to not be able to come here more often. We also had the sangria which was pretty good and packed a punch. They make the pizza fresh so be prepared to wait or order and appetizer/salad if you go super hungry. If I'm ever back in Chicago I will definitely be back!
