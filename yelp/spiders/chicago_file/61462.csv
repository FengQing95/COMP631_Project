Smoque BBQ////I've been to Smoque's restaurant once and loved the experience.  Nothing fancy or flashy, just meat cooked to perfection smokey perfection.  Again, their BBQ is not smothered in BBQ sauce, so if that's your thing, this may not be the place for you.  But if you love to drool over pure, delicious, smokey, and moist meat (omg...that sounds so perverted...HA!) than give this place a go!
