Little Goat Diner////This place is seriously the most adorable restaurant I have been to in my life.  First of all, there is a cute little spinning goat at the top of the building.  Next, the decor is modern yet retro 50's at the same time.  I ordered a latte and the foam had a little flower drawn in it.  There was one of those machines that you used to see in supermarkets where you put a quarter in and got a cheap toy, except you got a really adorable Little Goat pin for free.   There's also a photo booth so you can take pictures to remember the cutest diner of all time.   And of course, the food was very good.  We had a cinnamon bun that was to die for.  My friend ordered a burger and the accompanying fries tasted like BBQ chips.  I had a fried chicken sandwich served on white bread with shredded cabbage, which was also very good.
