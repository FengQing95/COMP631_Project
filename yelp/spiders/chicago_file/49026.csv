Smoque BBQ////Pretty good food for bbq in the city! but....... there was no sweet potato fries. I thought sweet potatoes were synonymous with bbq places!! Much disappointed there.. but the corn bread and peach cobbler were pretty good. We got there around 7p.m and had to wait to get into order, but we didn't have to wait too long to get seated for a group of 7. I did feel like I was playing bumper cars with other customers though as we were standing and trying to get water because it was just that packed!
