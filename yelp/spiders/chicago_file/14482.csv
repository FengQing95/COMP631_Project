Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was so excited to go to Chicago and have real Chicago style pizza.  We are from California and are spoiled with fresh food, fresh ingredients and inventive cooking.  Sadly, I would order Chicago style pizza any day in California and I would like to believe there is better pizza in the city of Chicago.  We ordered their signature deep dish mushroom and spinach pizza.  There was hardly any spinach and few mushrooms, which seemed to be from a can.  It was mostly just a cheese wad. I guess that is how they like it in Chicago because there was a huge line when we got there at 2:00 and it was still long when we left.
