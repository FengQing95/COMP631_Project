Art Institute of Chicago////If I had one complaint, it would be the cost. Yes, I do believe I got my $23 worth during my most recent visit, but I also believe that art should be within reach to everyone. I'm sure there are people in Chicago who are unable to take advantage of this amazing museum simply because they cannot afford it. Â
