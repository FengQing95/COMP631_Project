Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They have the most delicious and authentic Chicago style deep dish pizzas!!! Sadly, you really can't find pizza like this anywhere else in the nation. I've recently moved to California and can't seem to find a restaurant with acceptable deep dish pizzas. :( If you're in the Chicago area, these pizzas are a definite must have! My favorite is the Malnati Chicago Classic. :)
