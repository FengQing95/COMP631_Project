Little Goat Diner////This joint is inventive, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars. I ordered their chapati which was really heavy and greasy but it was very delicious. It came with eggs and salad. I wish they had put more salad on it though. My friend ordered the kimchi burger which she was not a big fan of. I enjoyed their coffee and server was very attentive.
