Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Stuffed from the meal, we decided to split the Butterscotch Flan for dessert.  It was perfect.  It was served in a small shot glass and I was tempted to order another, but resisted the urge to do so.  It was yummy, creamy, and full of butterscotch/caramel flavor.  Boyfriend likened it to the taste of a Werther's Original caramel candy drop, but the creamy, flan version.  The Butterscotch Flan was definitely noteworthy, but maybe they could have served a slightly bigger portion?  (...because I liked it so much!!! =P )
