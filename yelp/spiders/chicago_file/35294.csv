Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Hash Browns- These were the most sophisticated hash browns I've ever had! They were crispy and savory, with a slightly sweet caramelized onion topping.  They tasted really good but were definitely very heavy, I almost felt a little greasy after a few bites so I left it at that.  I'm glad to have tasted them but would skip them next time.
