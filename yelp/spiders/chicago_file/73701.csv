Little Goat Diner////On a whim, we decided to eat lunch at The Little Goat. We walked in (not knowing what to expect) and were pleasantly surprised by the unique ambiance and the yummy smells. We were seated at a two person table rather quickly, less than 20 minutes. We ordered a cinnabun and a crab dip for a "snack" (appetizer) and something else with a very long interesting name pronounced "yum" and the corned beef hash.
