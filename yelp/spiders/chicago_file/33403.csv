Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////So I'm giving this 4 stars, but it's possible that it could be way better or worse.  This was based off the decor and ambiance.  I got a huge bone in ribeye and had two bites, had some other food that was good.  Ordered a mint julep b/c it was The Masters Tournament that weekend thinking that was the drink when I really meant Azalea Cocktails.  Moral of the story, don't blow a bunch of cash at a restaurant when you are hammered.  Had some great steak and eggs the next day!
