The Purple Pig////I will have to deduct a star on the desserts as they were somewhat lazily prepared. The loukoumades didn't have any particular care put into them as they were kind of plopped on a plate with a lazy pool of honey. The vanilla panna cotta was precisely that; the texture was that of a firm tofu but nothing really made me think "WOW" while eating it. Also, the trio of gelato and sorbet were decent, the roasted white chocolate being the standpoint as it had a depth of layered flavor which we both appreciated.
