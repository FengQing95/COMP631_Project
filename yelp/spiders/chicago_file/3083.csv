The Purple Pig////Wonderful surprise.  It wasn't on our to do list but was a last minute recommendation, so glad we took it.   Delicious food and drinks.  The portions are bigger than typical tapas place, 3 items was enough for the two of us.   I would definitely recommend and come back here next time I'm in town.
