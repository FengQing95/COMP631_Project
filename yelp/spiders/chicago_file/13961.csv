Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm not generally a deep dish pizza pan, but we're on our annual Opera vaca to Chicago so thought I'd give it a second chance. I was glad I did and it was well worth the 30min wait for our Malnati's deep dish w pepperoni added. The cheese sticks were the 2nd worst I've ever had but the pizza more than made up for that and our server Andrew was pretty good too.
