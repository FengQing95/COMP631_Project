Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My BF is happy because there are vegetarian options, such as the warm goat cheese in tomato sauce, his mother is happy because she can order the Lobster Manolo plate and "it doesn't even TASTE Mexican!" (Yes, she really said that, and to the server's credit, he simply smiled. Yes, boyfriend left him a substantial tip).
