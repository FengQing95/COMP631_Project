Smoque BBQ////I just found out that I am allergic to wheat - so gluten free.  Eating out has been a challenge to say the least.  Smoque was awesome - When I mentioned to someone that I had allergies, they sent someone to speak with me and then he went into the kitchen to make sure they knew what was going on.
