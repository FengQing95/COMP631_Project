Art Institute of Chicago////I absolutely loved the art institute from start to finish. The building is huge in itself, so it would take multiple visits in order to be able to take in and see everything. Of course the most popular exhibits right now are the Obama Portraits and the Bisa Butler collection. I love the divided sections and the collections within them
