The Purple Pig////One of my all time favorites are the Grilled octopus and the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder. Fortunately, this place has a menu rich enough so customer get never bored of trying different dishes. Also, I always see people ordering the Bone Marrow; having tried myself but it seems to be a very popular dish.
