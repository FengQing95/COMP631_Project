Little Goat Diner////I had shrimp and cheesy grits and it was really yummy and flavorful but... I dunno. The service was pretty terrible. We were here for over an hour and we saw our waiter, like, twice. He did not seem to care at all about our experience. He appeared to take our order and deliver our order and that was pretty much it.
