Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The truth is, it's not distasteful pizza, Lou Malnati's is just very far from my preference. The crust is far too solid, similar to a bread cookie...their sauce is, for lack of a better word, not very "saucy"; if you like a chunkier, raw tomato texture and taste, it'd probably be ideal for you.
