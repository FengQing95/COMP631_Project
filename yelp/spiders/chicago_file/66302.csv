Little Goat Diner////My sister and I took my mother here for her birthday last weekend. The best way I can describe the food is upscale diner fare. My sister ordered the Chinese Chicken sandwich, and really liked it. (Similar to a bahn mi) My mother ordered a grilled cheese, and thought it was good too. I ordered the Macho Nachos, and found it to be a little bland. For dessert, we got the s'mores and pecan pie sundaes. Both were good. Unfortunately, our server was not the greatest. She practically ignored us after she brought us our meal. She never stopped by to refill our drinks, (Which means we all had nothing to drink for most of the meal) had to be asked several times to bring to go boxes and just seemed pretty apathetic in general. She is the reason why this review is a 2 star, and not a 3. Service aside, the prices are high for what your get, (Everything is a la carte) and no better than going to a less famous/trendy place. I am not opposed to going back, but will probably not make the effort to go again myself.
