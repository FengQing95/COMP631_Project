Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////You will need to reserve a table way in advance because they do things right and the waiting list is long! Worth the wait. When you enter the restaurant, you will sigh with content on the ambiance. The waiters are top shelf and well versed in GF options. Plenty of great options, most things actually. There were 4 in our party and every single dish was outstanding! Yes, the sides are a'l a 'carte but they are worth double what they charge, really! You will be amazed how satisfying and complimentary the sides are to your main plate.
