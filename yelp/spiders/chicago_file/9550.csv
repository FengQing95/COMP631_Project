Art Institute of Chicago////My last visit before this weekend was February 2007, but much has been made recently of the closed galleries.  It must be disappointing to be turned away from a favorite piece or genre, but as others have mentioned, there is so much to take in that one can easily find worthwhile replacements to peruse on one's visit.  Apparently the day of our visit was the first day of the new Impressionist wing, and it looks good.  The new galleries extend directly beyond the Caillebotte centerpiece in the big room at the top of the stairs, with the famous Seurat (A Sunday on La Grand Jatte) at the center of the large room immediately behind it.
