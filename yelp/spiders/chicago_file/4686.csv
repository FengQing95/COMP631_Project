The Purple Pig////I definitely recommend the pork blade steak. The meat was so juicy and tender. It literally melted in my mouth! We also got the bone marrow dish. It was my first time trying bone marrow and I was pleasantly surprised. It came in a small portion, but it was the perfect appetizer. It also comes with bread that you eat it together with.
