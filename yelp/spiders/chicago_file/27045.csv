Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The first time I came here I got the Chicago Classic to go. It was about a 35 min wait and by the time I got back to my hotel to dig in, the sausage topping had shifted and the cheese didn't stretch when I bit into it, which is my favorite part of eating pizza. The crust was good but verged on being too buttery.
