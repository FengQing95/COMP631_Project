Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I started with the malnati salad and that was a solid life choice. The blue Gorgonzola and olives were nice touches. It was a bit more expensive than other salads but totally worth the up charge in my opinion. You could possible share this with someone else (if you're into sharing) as an appetizer if you wanted.
