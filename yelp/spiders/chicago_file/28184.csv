Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I called a Togo order and when they say how long it will take they aren't messing around! It was promptly ready at the time they said it would be. It was my first time having deep dish pizza and it was AMAZING! We had a medium pepperoni and sausage. The place is hectic and very busy! The environment is also pretty loud and close together with the large volume of guests that come thru it shouldn't come as a surprise. Like most popular places in the city there are lines and waits associated with the experience. Keep that in mind when you visit :)
