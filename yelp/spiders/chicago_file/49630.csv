Smoque BBQ////I think I have discovered that I am just not a fan of smoked meats.  My husband LOVES this place and is always trying to convince me over, but no dice.  He actually made a cab wait there last week while he went in to get full pounds of both the brisket AND the pulled pork - which he then ate for the next 4 days (doesn't hat stuff get dried-out even more in the fridge to the point where no sauce will help?  Gross.)
