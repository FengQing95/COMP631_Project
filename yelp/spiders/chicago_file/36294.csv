Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////A steak is just a steak and there are a lot of good restaurants that can cook a good steak, that alone doesn't let a restaurant get a perfect score.  The reason this restaurant gets 5 stars is because everything worked in conjunction with each other to a great experience.  The hosts were accommodating when we didn't have a reservation, the waiter was excellent, the drinks and food were delicious, and the ambiance was perfect.  You are definitely getting what you pay for at Bavette's.
