Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love this place and was so upset with our visit. Our waitress did not come over once after taking our order until we had to flag her down because we wanted our check. Not to ask if we wanted another drink, ask how our food was, etc. Throughout our meal we had wanted to order another drink and more food but were unable to because of the lack of service. We were seated in a back room so I believe we had just been forgotten about.
