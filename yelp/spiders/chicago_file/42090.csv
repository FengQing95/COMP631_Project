Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is great!  The service has been great on every occasion except for one when it was still good, but not spot on.  The food is always excellent and I don't think I will ever get tired of the selections.  Some nights can get very busy, so I would recommend calling ahead, especially on a Friday or Saturday night.
