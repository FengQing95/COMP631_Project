Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered sausage and mushroom deep dish. When it came out, it looked awesome. Then they do the whole "pull the slice up slowly from the pan as to stretch the cheese so you can take your Instagram photo" move. Cool move, bro. As I started eating the pizza, I began to realize that it's literally a SHEET of sausage between the cheese and the sauce. It was sooo overwhelming. A lot of the sausage just ended up on the side of my plate.
