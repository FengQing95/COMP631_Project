Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We went to another deep dish pizza place and love it so wanted to try another. Lou Malnati was a miss for us. First they took us upstairs where a big party was and they were so loud we could hardly hear each other. Then they got our entire pizza wrong and offered to remake only half of what they got wrong. We finally got them to agree to remake the whole thing so they they made twice as many pizzas. 1st they only took about 15 min...not sure how that was possible given they say it takes 30 min to cook and 2nd we didn't want that much pizza we are in a hotel. Next the sauce was too chunky and the pizza layers just fell apart nothing like the first place we went. AND they still charged us for the entire bill no discount at all. Â We won't go back to Lou's and I would not recommend it at all.
