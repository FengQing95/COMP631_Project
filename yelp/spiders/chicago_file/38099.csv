Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My gf said her filet may have been the best she ever had. My NY strip wasn't as tender as I expected and had more fat then I would have liked. Both steaks were cooked perfectly and had good char flavor. We both agreed that the mashed potatoes may have been the best we've ever had. The elote style corn not so much.
