Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Speed of food preparation: As expected...for a deep dish pizza. Something to keep in mind when ordering a deep dish pizza is that because of the thick crust and heavy amount of toppings, your pizza will normally take 35 minutes to make. If a restaurant claims to have a deep dish ready for you in 15 minutes then either they are reheating an old pizza or not serving a true deep dish pizza.
