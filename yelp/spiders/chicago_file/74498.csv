Little Goat Diner////Anna was our server for our first time visit at Little Goat Diner, and she was absolutely amazing. If I could leave 6 stars I would! Great food. Great service. Great experience. I am so satisfied with our visit and cannot wait to come back for the Okonomiyaki and the smiling faces!
