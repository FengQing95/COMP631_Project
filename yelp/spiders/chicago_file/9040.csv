Art Institute of Chicago////How have I not been here before? The Art Institute is a must see when in Chicago. I originally came to check out the Hokusai print exhibit (closing tomorrow) but was immediately distracted by the vast array of other art collections-- you are bound to find something you've never seen or heard of before. Case in point-- I discovered a wonderful collection of miniature rooms (smaller than dollhouse size) decorated in the style of different regions and time periods. Who would have thought? Yes, you will see classic pieces here, but sometimes you may find an artwork you're never seen before that resonates with you.
