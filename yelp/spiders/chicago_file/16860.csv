Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's Pizza is as authentic as you can get. We shut down the venue and had our pick of pizza slices and cookies. I tried genuine cheese and veggie and both were stunning, giving NY a run for its money. I will be back and next time I'm in Chicago will definitely recommend my friends to see this fine establishment upon seeing Chicago.
