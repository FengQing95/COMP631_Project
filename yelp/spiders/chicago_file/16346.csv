Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We tried two pizzas - the Malnati Chicago Classic and the Lou. Both were pretty good, we debated at the table which was better and I think we were split 2-2. The serving estimates in the menu were very accurate for us as we ordered two smalls and it was perfect for the four of us but we had also ordered the Spinach salad which was also pretty good.
