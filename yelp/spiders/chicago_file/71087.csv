Little Goat Diner////Dudes. These pancakes were amazing. They were huge, and hot, and filled with appley deliciousness and topped with oatmeal crumbles. I could only get through a 1/4 of them, so I took them home and ate them up for dinner last night, and they were still delicious. The manfriend had the Breakfast Pasta which he said was amazing.
