Smoque BBQ////There was a 1 hour wait time for call-in carryout orders at 4:45pm (pick-up at 5:45pm) on a Sunday.  We learned that you can just walk up and maybe wait 30 minutes total if you see the line go from the counter to the door.  They are experienced and pretty quick with the lines.  I'm sure the wait times are all over the map depending on day and time.  Nearby street parking was easy to find.  What's with all these restaurants on the NW side of Chicago anyway (Kumas, Hot Doug's) - don't they have any where you can just come in and order and eat  ??
