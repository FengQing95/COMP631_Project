Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Yep this is a 5 star worthy steakhouse I had the bone in 10 oz. fillet and it was one of the most tender and loving cuts of beef I have ever had the opportunity to eat. The steak was seared to perfection and bursting with flavor. They do not cover it in butter and bring it out on a sizzling plate so if that's your thing may not be for you. They have a romantic dimly lit setting and employ very well versed professional servers. Our server helped us make the best selections and never made me feel rushed. It was a fantastic meal and definitely one of the best steaks and meals I have had this decade. I love food and eat out at every chance I can. Â Please stop reading this review and make a reservation.
