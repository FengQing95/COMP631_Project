Little Goat Diner////If I had to choose two cons of this place, they would be 1. that they ran out of the shrimp and grits, and 2. (and this is super super nit picky), the table we sat at was in the light from the sunroof and there was a glare on me the whole time and I was sooo hot from the sun, even though it was freezing out. I was at the ONE table this impacted so really it's not a big deal.
