Art Institute of Chicago////I don't get to museums as often as I'd like, but when I do go, part of it makes me feel older or more serious or mature or something (and those that have ever read any of my reviews know I'm rarely that), like those in this portrait. This piece personifies all the people watching that goes on at a museum, because we just can't stare at walls for hours (at least I can't).
