Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The lady and I came about an hour before closing- wow! We ordered the octopus, the salmon, the olives, the shrimp, and the croquettes. The octopus could've had more meat and less potatoes but the shrimp, oh my lord the shrimp. Perfect. Ordered a few cocktails as well. The service was impeccable and the entire atmosphere of the place was vibrant, fun, and happy.
