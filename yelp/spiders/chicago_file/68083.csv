Little Goat Diner////So after an all day anticipation, and being really hungry I made the mistake of coming in at 3:45ish on one of their first Saturdays. They did so well that day that had to close the kitchen for them to regroup. I was a bit upset, and expressed it, but the cool headed staff handled my grumbling stomach and attitude really nicely. I was offered more than I deserved.
