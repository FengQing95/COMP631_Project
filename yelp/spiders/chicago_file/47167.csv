Smoque BBQ////You will wait it line, but worth it. Â Best option - call and carry out. To me this is a Great date night... BYOB, cafeteria-like with the seating, and very casual. Their mac and cheese is AMAZEBALLS and their coleslaw, and their brisket chili. Pulled Pork sandwich and whatever style ribs are awesome! It is down the street from me so we are tempted all the time.
