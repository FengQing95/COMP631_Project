Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The salad was individual-sized, but served as a perfect appetizer for two. The server was nice enough to get us two dressings since we couldn't decide. The red wine vinaigrette was somewhere between extremely subtle to bland. The creamy lemon garlic was very tasty, but only in very small doses. Somehow, we managed to find a nice balance in mixing them.
