Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is by far my favorite restaurant in Chicago. I love love love the small plates. I love the ambiance and overall experience of coming to Ba-Ba-Reeba. The restaurant feels huge so even if it's crowded and noisy, you can still enjoy your meal without feeling cramped by anyone.
