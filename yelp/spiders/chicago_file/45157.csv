Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love this place and willl go here any time any of my friends want to go. Every time I go I order this potato tapas that just makes me want more. In addition, we always order the shrimp with garlic dipping sauce and the meatball. Sangria are good but I'll pass only because I do not like to drink alcoholic beverages while eating.
