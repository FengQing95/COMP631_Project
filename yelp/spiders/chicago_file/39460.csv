Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I was disappointed to find out that they do not have valet service. If you are going, be sure to park at the Mart Park Garage a half block north. Bavette's gives you a sticker that saves you about 80% on the price. Fortunately, it wasn't raining when we arrived or when we left.
