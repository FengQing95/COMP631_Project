Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////There were about 20 of us set up at a long table towards the back of the restaurant, so as the food started to come out things got crowded pretty fast. Several plates of our various tapas were spread out throughout the table so there was more than enough food to go around. We also had quite a few pitchers of red and white sangria spread around and the waitress brought us more bottled wine than we needed.
