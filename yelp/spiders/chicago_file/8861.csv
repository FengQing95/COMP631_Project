Art Institute of Chicago////It doesn't matter how many times I see some paintings as I love them each time I see them.  The first to mention is the painting that every fan of Ferris Bueller knows---the Seurat, A Sunday on La Grande Jatte.  Pointillism.  I made a pointillism picture in 8th grade art---that was only the size of a sheet of paper and it took ages.  I can't even fathom the vision and talent it took to create this piece.  It's just amazing.
