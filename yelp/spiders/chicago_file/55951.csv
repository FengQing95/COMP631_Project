Smoque BBQ////The food is flat out amazing. I had the brisket platter with fries and mac and cheese. It was so good. The brisket was so tender it fell apart when I was trying to stab it with a fork...maybe I should have used a spoon to dip it in the awesome sauce! The mac and cheese was perfect--not too creamy, cheese, or runny. Seriously awesome. The fries may have been some of the best I have had. I got my standard ketchup, salt, pepper---I didn't use any of it really. They were perfect. Â I did use one packet of ketchup to mix with the BBQ sauce and dip with the fries, that was excellent--but not necessary.
