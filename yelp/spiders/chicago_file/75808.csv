Little Goat Diner////The menu offers very traditional breakfast items from pancakes to eggs, and also puts a little spin on it by incorporating Izard's whimsy into the dishes. We started off with some coffee, I opted for the Barista's Special. It was essentially a S'mores latte, topped with a nice heap of marshmallow fluff. It tasted just like a S'more and was a delicious way to begin the meal.
