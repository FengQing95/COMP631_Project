Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Unfortunately I was unimpressed. I was excited to go, but the pizza was underwhelming. The pizza arrived at the table kind of cold and with that much cheese on a pizza, you want it to be straight out of the oven. They have a good lunch deal though, with a salad, a personal pizza, and a drink for under $10.
