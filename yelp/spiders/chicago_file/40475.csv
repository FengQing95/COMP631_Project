Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It took a bit for our server to come to us and when he finally did we placed our drink order ( I think from the moment we sat down until our drinks came it was about 20 minutes)- under normal circumstances I would not complain BUT we were then reminded that we only had a 90 minute seating and I already felt rushed especially since the initial greeting and cocktail order took 20 minutes.
