Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've had pizza everywhere and this is my favorite. Â Perfect ratio. Great ingredients. Just the best. Sorry New York, best pizza ever right here at Lou's. As others say, Giordanos is too cheesy. Here it's perfect. Get the sausage. Its like a whole layer or fresh sausage. It's delicious.
