Art Institute of Chicago////The institute's levels are broken up so you can't continuously wander throughout one level without going up or down the stairs, crossing to another area and starting again. I've experienced it at other galleries, so it is nothing new, but can be a challenge if you are in a group and your cell phone reception (thanks AT&T) isn't great.
