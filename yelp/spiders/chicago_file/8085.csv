Art Institute of Chicago////The work in the wing however is not all that great. I don't really get too interested in most contemporary art, especially when it comes to photography. The best part of that wing is the design related pieces. Those really are nice, and I have totally looked up and referenced some of the graphic and lighting designers that are exhibited. If you do like design, you might think it's worth checking out.
