Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My wife and I were recently in Chicago for the weekend and were in search of the best pizza we could find.  Some research and good advice pointed us towards Lou Malnati's.  We stopped in here and were seated right away.  Our servers were very friendly and chatted with us for a bit before we placed our order.  We decided to go with the calamari for our appetizer.  What a great choice it was!  This was some of the most tender and just perfect calamari we had ever tasted.  While raving about the calamari, we waited for our pizza to come out.  As usual with deep dish, it takes 30 or 40 minutes to cook.  The pizza finally arrived at the table and it looked delicious.  We ordered a 9" small deep dish with pepperoni, sausage, mushroom and butter crust.  We were in heaven upon taking our first bite of the pizza.  It had a great flavor and was just wonderful, crust and all.  We still had a bit of room left after the pizza and decided to try the chocolate chip cookie dessert pizza that I heard rave reviews about.  It is a warm chocolate chip cookie baked in a personal pizza pan and then topped with vanilla ice cream, chocolate sauce, whipped cream, and a cherry.  It was excellent.  Lou Malnatti's is now the best deep dish pizza I have ever had.  Back in the day, Gino's East was my favorite, but this is now my new favorite.  I will be back here every time for sure whenever I come to Chicago
