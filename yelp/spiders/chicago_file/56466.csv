Smoque BBQ////He chose the St. Louis Style Ribs w/ Corn Bread & French Fries.  The ribs were rich in smokey flavor, moist, tender but still edible off the bone (without crumbling).  The corn bread was average and, although I'm not huge on french fries, there is something about the aroma of theirs that makes me sneak a few out of his bag when he's not looking.  I chose the Sliced Brisket w/ Brisket Chili & Mac & Cheese.   YES!  The brisket chili was so good that I actually got a second side all for myself!  The sliced brisket was so tender that I struggled to actually pick it up with my fork.  The accommodating BBQ sauce that comes along with it on the side had the perfect amount of zest without overpowering the flavor of the brisket itself.  The mac & cheese was also delicious.
