Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Service and Atmosphere: Our waiter Brandon was attentive without being overbearing, and he showed knowledge of the menu and provided us with tips and his favorite dishes. The ambiance is perfect for a night out with your significant other or good friends, with classic music, dim lights, etc. Definitely a cool vibe that is different than a lot of other steak houses.
