Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As a Floridian visiting Chicago, my knowledge of deep dish pizza is very limited so we relied on a buddy of mine who is a local for his recommendation. He recommended we check out Lou Malnati's in downtown and he was not wrong. The pizza was legit. Being used to very commercial, crappy pizza down in Florida this was a treat. Just make sure you give yourself plenty of time as they did warn us upon ordering that it'd take about 40 minutes for the pizza to be ready, but it's worth the wait.
