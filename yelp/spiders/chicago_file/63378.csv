Smoque BBQ////I'm a big fan of great BBQ, and this is one of the best in the area.  One reason I give them 5 stars is because of how good the sides are too!  So many places cut corners and serve mediocre sides. Not this place. The only drawback to this restaurant is parking can't be difficult to find in this residential area of town.
