Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've been doing my research and found that Chicago had some great place for steaks.  I made reservations at this restaurant since it was on several lists and I wanted to see how the chi matched up with LA's top steakhouses.  I have to say it was pretty good; as soon as you walked in, the place felt like it was full of history even if it was just opened in 2012.  I ordered the medium-rare classic rib eye (16oz), the garlic mash and the eloyte corn on the sides.  With the steak, i felt that it tasted better with each bite and when you mixed in the mash potato and corn, you have a spectacular combination of what great food ought to be.  I washed it down with a Tokyo old fashion which was blissfully tasteful.  Overall, the experience and ambience was great!
