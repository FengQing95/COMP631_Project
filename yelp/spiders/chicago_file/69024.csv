Little Goat Diner////Love the casual diner feel, if only it didn't come with a 2 hour wait. But alas the wait was worth it and the food was delicious. We split a blueberry pie milkshake which tasted exactly how it sounds and was incredible. I had the spring quesadilla with asparagus, goat cheese and BLUEBERRIES! Yeah blueberries in a quesadilla. It was borderline genius and so fresh, springy and delicious. Our service was excellent. Can't wait to come back.
