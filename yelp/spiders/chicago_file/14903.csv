Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////About 3 or 4 years ago, my Aunt sent me frozen pizza as a gift.  She is from Chicago and sent me a Lou Malnati's frozen pie.  Not being from Chicago, I'd never heard of Lou Malnati's before.  I made the pizza for dinner one night and could not believe how good it was.  I was shocked - if it's this good frozen, how good can it be fresh?  Then, I saw Malnati's on Food Wars and they won best deep dish in Chicago.  I knew I had to get to this place.
