Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Typically, we get take-out and eat at home. While I've eaten "in" at the Wells St location, we get most of our pies from the Lincoln-Wrightwood shop, can't say that we've ever eaten "in" there. The Lincoln location is a typical Pizza-Italian restaurant, no reason not to eat in except that home is close and more comfortable ;-)
