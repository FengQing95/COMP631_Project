Little Goat Diner////The fare at LG is a wonderful mixture of sandwiches, burgers and breakfast plates. The flavors are serious, as exemplified by the sandwich my girlfriend got: the Los Drowned. This braised beef masterpiece hit on all cylinders. The flavors of the sandwich were complimented by the textural contrast between the crunchy hoagie roll and the tender beef.
