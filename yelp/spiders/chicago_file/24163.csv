Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The wait here is ridiculous. At 9:30, we waited an hour and a half. We even pre-ordered our pizzas when we checked in, because we were told it would be cooking and ready soon after we got our table. When we finally got a table, it took forever for a server to take our drink order. Then came back 40 minutes later with our pizza. We got a small deep dish and small thin crust pepperoni. It was our first time eating deep dish, and it was honestly disgusting. Nothing is cohesive. Water runs out when you cut into it. The cheese almost chokes you it's so thick. Not a fan. But the thin crust was the saving grace. It was very good! It was a little thicker than a thin crust you might get at a chain like Pizza Hut or Domino's. And honestly, it may have only been "so good" because the deep dish was so gross. Don't think we'd ever come back.
