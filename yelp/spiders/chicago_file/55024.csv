Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We had our wedding here in April. We worked closely with the staff and let them know some of our preferences. Our parents both had dietary restrictions, so it was important to us to have dairy free and gluten free options. It was also important to us to have a gift table in the room set up with some photos and mementos.
