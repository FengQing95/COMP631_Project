Little Goat Diner////My family was visiting Chicago and decided to eat at the Little Goat Diner. It was a fabulous choice. All 11 of us had outstanding food. Ethan Jorjorian suggested the corned beef hash. Â It was the most memorable corned beef hash I could recall. We also had coffee in the bar area. The lattes and blueberry muffins were out of this world. We will definitely be back.
