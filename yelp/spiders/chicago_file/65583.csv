Smoque BBQ////I stopped getting brisket because I have been bitten so many with shoe leather crap from lots of places but after having Smoque which is at this point the only place I will order brisket because it's constantly pleasing. I get the sliced, not chopped brisket which is always juicy/tender/melt on your mouth. It has a small amount fat for flavor and a nice bark on a very fresh soft/light bun, sauce on the side because it's not needed but I use it.
