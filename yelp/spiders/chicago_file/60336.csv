Smoque BBQ////The toughest critic was the 6 year old, who deemed the mac and cheese delicious, and wanted to know if I had any idea what the "secret ingredient" was in the mac and cheese.  I ventured that it might be butter, and he agreed... until we had been there for a while, the mac and cheese got cold, and then his decree shifted from delicious to disgusting in one drop.  Can't please all the people all the time, I guess.
