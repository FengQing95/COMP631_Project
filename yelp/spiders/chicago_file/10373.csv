Art Institute of Chicago////Each floor is a new adventure.  Plan on spending 2-3 hours to really get a full experience. If you get hungry there is a snack shop along the way that also serves beer and wine!!  Very important for the alcoholic art lovers out there.  We enjoyed a nice IPA to keep or buzz.
