Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have to say that opinions on deep-dish among my acquaintances are as varied as the weather here. While I fail to see how combining a ton of cheese and meat and peppers with sauce and a crust can possibly be bad, certain friends avoid it unless they really have to eat it. I think they're just on a diet.
