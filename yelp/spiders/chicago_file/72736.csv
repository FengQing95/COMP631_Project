Little Goat Diner////Little Goat delivers big taste!  This was my first visit to Little Goat today for a late lunch. The place is very busy so expect a long wait. The restaurant is an upscale diner, very noisy; the menu offers a variety of innovative dishes from breakfast to sammies to supper.  We waited for our table in the bar and had two very good drinks, a spicy good Bloody Mary and a Moscow Goat. The staff we encountered both at the bar and the restaurant were friendly and by their smiles, looked like they enjoyed being there. Our waitress, Joan, was warm, friendly, attentive and offered good suggestions. My husband had the ooey gooey cinnabun served warm with a yummy cream cheese icing which I, of course, had to taste. So good and, yes, gooey.  My husband had the shrimp and grits for his entree. The shrimp were plentiful and the grits cheesy. I had the grilled cheese which was layered with flavors of smoked tomatoes, two kinds of cheeses and pork guanciale (pork cheek).  So delicious.  I had the side of tempura mashed potatoes...omg!  Perfection and unique.  Actually, a lot of the offerings on the menu are unique takes on some diner classics.  The only negative to my experience is the banana cupcake with peanut butter frosting that I took home from the bakery. It was a dense banana bread cupcake with a peanut butter buttercream. It was just so-so. As a hobbyist cupcake baker, I make a more moist cupcake. I was disappointed. The restaurant definitely did not disappoint, though. I definitely think Little Goat is worth the wait.  I look forward to my next visit.
