The Purple Pig////To me when I go to a restaurant it's all about the entire experience of the meal, and as soon as my party of five arrived we were greeted with very unwelcoming faces and a lot of attitude from the host and staff, first telling us that we had to be out by 5:45 because they had a reservation for that table, (it was 3:00 when we arrived) I definitely don't think that we ever would've stayed almost three hours and even if I wanted to the place was empty I'm sure they could've accommodated us, immediately I was upset due to the rudeness and stern attitude of the man and woman who seated us, our waiter was attentive and friendly but I had already been ticked of from the rude welcome I really couldn't relax my entire meal, which turned out to be very good. I enjoyed every plate that came out, but because of how we were treated I do not think I will be returning.
