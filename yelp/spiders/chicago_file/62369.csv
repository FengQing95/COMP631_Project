Smoque BBQ////It's been a long time since I'd wrote an reciew, but this just made it impossible not to write one. I found one of my new favorite place for bbq. I'd got the brisket and it's perfect. Soft and juicy and tender. Tasteful bbq sauce without overwhelming the meat. I don't like coleslaw but I like theirs. Everything is delicious. Price is reasonable and they have free street parking. Friendly service and definitely worth the 2,000+ reviews. Texas girl approved!
