Little Goat Diner////Their foods often have an Asian twist which I like, and I like how they have a lot of sweet and savory dishes, my personal favorite of the bunch is bull's eye french toast, it's perfectly soft and has strawberries on it. The crab dip is a great comfort food as well, it's not too salty and gets really addicting at first bite. Little Goat's chili is very good as well and its found in various dishes, I'm not a huge fan of chili but it's strong tasting and delicious. I haven't been here for a while, but definitely want to come back to try some of the new dishes on the menu!
