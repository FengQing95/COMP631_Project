Little Goat Diner////One thing I will say is that the dishes are certainly not your run of the mill options.  I did enjoy the brandade and belly which is kind of a pork belly and kimchee eggs benedict sort of thing.  The ingredients all seem very fresh, it's more that the combination of flavors doesn't do it for me.
