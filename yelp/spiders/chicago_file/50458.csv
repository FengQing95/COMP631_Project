Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I am just not a fan of tapas, but where my friends go, I go too. I just hate the idea of paying $8 for a couple of shrimp that everyone has to fight over and being the polite one, I go last and get scraps but then have to split the bill evenly. So, the last two times I've been here, I've ordered my own plates. But that still means I'm spending $30 on two skewers of meat, and a glass or two of sangria. I admit the portions here are a little better than some places, though I think this place is hyped up a bit more and so is more expensive than maybe Cafe Iberico which has even better portions and prices.
