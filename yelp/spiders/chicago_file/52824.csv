Smoque BBQ////I'm giving this 5 stars bc it is the best BBQ I've encountered in Chicago.  I live close and order take-out from here at least once or twice a week and love it.  The Chopped Brisket Platter (with an extra bun and cornbread instead of slaw) is always more than enough for me and my wife.
