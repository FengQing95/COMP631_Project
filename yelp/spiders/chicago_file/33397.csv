Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We had a 9 pm reservation.  However, there was a 830 pm opening on OpenTable.  I called the restaurant and asked if I could change the reservation to 830 pm instead.  The gentleman told me I could come in at 830 pm.  The party before us was eating for 3-4 hours and therefore, despite coming in at 830 pm, we were seated at 9 pm (about a 30 minute wait).  The manager was cool about it and took care of desserts, but if you cant sit a party at 830 I wouldnt tell your guests to come in at 830 pm.
