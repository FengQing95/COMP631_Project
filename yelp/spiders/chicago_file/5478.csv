The Purple Pig////Finally, we had the bone marrow because that was the most ordered item around. I've never had bone marrow before, so I had a high expectation for this. It was huge!! Very fatty tasting, but it didn't make me feel "greasy". So that was great. Slap it on the crunchy/ soft side bread and top it with cilantro, and well enjoy!
