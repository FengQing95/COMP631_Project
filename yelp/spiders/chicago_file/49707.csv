Smoque BBQ////So I've been dying to try this place forever and last night I finally got my wish! I had the sliced brisket sandwich with mac n' cheese.....my friend got the ribs with mac n' cheese & fries. Overall....yummy for my tummy.....but was a little disappointed that the brisket wasn't really juicy....I am a sauce fan and while I don't want the meat to be swimming in it.....I did have to use all of my extra sauce and then steal my friends to use as well....boo :( Â Mac n' Cheese was awesome creamy and deeee-lish! Fries got the thumbs up as well......I will be back!!
