Little Goat Diner////As for the cafe/bakery section, it was very cool. They have a top-of-the-line espresso machine, and they display that and the other equipment very nicely in a small counter area. It's a bit confusing, as this area is located at the front of the shop, but you order your coffee in the back. There's a small sign that tells you this though.
