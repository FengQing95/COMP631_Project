Little Goat Diner////Little Goat exceeded expectations! In a city like Chicago, it's hard to stand out, but Little Goat's quirky and unique menu, along with an instagram-worthy atmosphere, did not disappoint. I sat at the counter top and was able to watch a spectrum of mouth watering dishes come out of the kitchen, making it next to impossible to decide on a meal. The staff was attentive and energetic, so I never felt like i was waiting around for service. I ordered 'This Little Piggy Went to China', and I left full and satisfied. Definitely a must visit spot if you're ever in the west loop
