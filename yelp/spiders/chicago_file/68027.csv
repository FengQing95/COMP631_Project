Little Goat Diner////If you would like to eat somewhere that is not relaxing and be extremely disappointed, go here.  This place is the quintessential place for millennials to eat at and brag to their friends that they went there based on the popularity of Girl and the Goat.  Personally I had the corned beef hash and eggs which took them forever to make and was terrible. The corned beef was sliced and draped over the shredded potatoes which led to a bizarre presentation and it tasted strange.  Based on what everyone else ordered it's clear that this place relies heavily on tempura style frying and adding pickled whatnot to its dishes to give the appearance of being high end.   Unless you need photos for Instagram to up your status with "friends," skip this place.
