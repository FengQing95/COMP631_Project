Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////5. All in all, as an experience, we left feeling short changed, and we don't plan to go back any time soon.  We had expected the steak to shine as Bavette's claims to be a steak house, yet the glimmers of genius coming from the kitchen had more to do with sourdough bread and big shrimp than their steak.  And the "we don't really care about you" vibe we got from the employees means we really don't think we want to bother returning to Bavette's any time soon. There are just too many great Chicago steakhouses to bother going back.
