Smoque BBQ////they have the methods and the madness down but my three stars is for lack of consistency!! one needs to eat here to have an idea about the top 10 bbq joints in Chicago!! if you get there during a fresh shoulder or solid rack of ribs - or succulent brisket! you could die of a foodgazim!!
