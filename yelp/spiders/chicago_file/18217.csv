Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our first visit while visiting Chicago and we came hungry.  The wait for a Sunday night was 60 minutes  but I think worth the wait.   I suggest for long wait to preorder your deep dish.   We ordered a large Malnati's Chicago Classic deep dish, BuffaLou wings, spinach bread, calamari and kids spaghetti.   Enough food for my family of 5.  Food was fabulous but customer service was NOT.  Everyone seemed rushed and were quite unfriendly.  We had to track down someone to refill drinks.   Our waiter came to our table a total of 3 times; to take the rest of our order, drop the food off, and to deliver the check.
