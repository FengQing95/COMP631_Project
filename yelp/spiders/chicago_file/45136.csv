Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food was delicious, as always. Many of the people in my group were eating tapas for the first time, and they loved it. Even the pickiest eaters in the bunch found something to like. I enthusiastically recommend the bacon-wrapped dates and baked goat cheese. Other popular items with our group were the short rib plate and the tortilla espanola.
