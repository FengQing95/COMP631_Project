Little Goat Diner////Homemade everything.  Bread with bacon baked into it.  Wow, wow, wow!  We had a veggie quesadilla and a grilled cheese that was one of the most hearty sandwiches I've ever eaten.  Rebecca was our very kind, accommodating, knowledgeable, and professional server.  I could eat here all day every day.....and weigh 500 pounds, but it might jus be worth it!
