Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Café Ba-Ba Reeba was actually my first tapas experience, and a very nice one at that.  I, having been known to struggle with decisions (friends, stop snickering) saw this discovery as bittersweet.  Due to the fact that I love the idea of tapas after having been introduced to it, but was saddened that so many nights of hair pulling anxiety could have been avoided if I had only known about it sooner.  Ahh, on to the review...Choose the Pintxos Platter and you won't be disappointed.  I can personally vouch for the Chorizo-wrapped Medjool Date & Cheese, Bacon Wrapped Shrimp and the Short Rib-Stuffed Piquillo Pepper.  Each of these dishes came two pieces to a plate and they were loaded with enough flavors to send your taste buds into the Merengue.  I could have kept ordering these three dishes all night, but with so many more options how could I not torture myself?  Moving on, the Meatballs with Sherry Tomato Sauce, Chicken & Ham Croquetas and Roast Dates with Bacon & Apple Vinaigrette made their way out.  The stand out dish here was the Croquetas.  Ay, dios mio!  The meatballs were delicious, on a very familiar level, so if you're looking to experience new flavors I would choose something else.  If you want a delicious meatball, order away.  As for the Roast Dates, I would skip them.  These dates are much larger than the dates on the Pitxos menu, so be aware that the main, and almost only, flavor you taste here is the date.  I love dates, but come on, leave some room for the bacon!
