Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I am not sure I understand the hype around Bavette. We shared the mixed green salad with apple and the dry aged bone in ribeye (medium rare) and the salad turned out more of a winner Â than the ostensible best steak in Chicago. The meat was not tender, seemed underseasoned and the temperature was off. It was not at all a terrible meal, but we came away feeling a little disappointed.
