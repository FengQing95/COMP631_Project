Art Institute of Chicago////I'm not sure what my favorite work was, it was either Van Gogh's 'Bedroom at Arles' or seeing 'A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte' by Georges Seurat (you know, the painting where Cameron was metaphysically transformed from being mopey rich kid with daddy issues to full blown avant-guard/catatonic suicidal-ideations in the 80's classic mainstream blockbuster 'Ferris Buellers Day Off') or the Snow White and the Seven Dwarves Lock. Other favorites were Maximilien Luce 'La Saint-Chappelle' and Pierre Auguste Renoir 'Rowers Lunch'.
