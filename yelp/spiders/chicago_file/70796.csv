Little Goat Diner////The Bad ... well there's nothing that's stand out bad. I know these are just so nit picky. But after eating at Girl and Goat a couple night before, this just felt like it should not be called anything Goat related. It was just a general disappointment of a meal outside of the breads and juice.
