Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Two years ago I dined here for my birthday and was blown away by the service, ambiance, food and overall attention to detail. I decided I wanted to feel that special again so I made reservations for my birthday this past weekend, but sadly...all the feelings I had before were replaced with confusion, annoyance, and disappointment.
