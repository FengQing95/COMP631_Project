Smoque BBQ////When we walked in we were greeted by Carlos aka Omar, who asked if it was our first time. I love it when a restaurant recognizes new customers and lends a helping hand. He was very helpful and recommended we try the beef brisket. He told us it was his favorite. I also thought his story about his nickname was cute. They call him Omar because there are too many other Carlos working there. It was funny how he delivered it.
