Little Goat Diner////Best. Bloody Mary. Ever. Words escape me. I didn't think a tomato juice drink could possibly be this delicious, and yet here I stand corrected. No crappy zing-zang mix here, this bloody Mary is out of this world. I think if we could all start the day off with vodka, pickled onion juice, kimchi, masala, and miso adorned with a goat cheese stuffed olive and pickled pepper... the world would be a much better place.
