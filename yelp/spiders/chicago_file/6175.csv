The Purple Pig////Wow wow wow. This has easily shot to the top of my list as one of the best restaurants in the city. Every bite was absolutely delicious and beyond well done. I can't even pick my favorite bite because everything was delicious although I would say you can't leave here without ordering the crispy pig ear. We enjoyed the Babic wine which was a suggestion as a great pairing on a lot of the dishes we ordered. I thought I was full and then saw the dessert menu had a goat cheese cheesecake and so I made room. I can't wait to come back here to try their meat and cheeses and another wine. A perfect date night spot.
