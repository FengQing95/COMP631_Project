Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////As for the entrees, again, you can't go wrong.  The paella is good if you're hungry or in a group, but I normally fill up on the tapas and the toro brochetas....aka heavenly skewers of perfectly grilled meat on a gigantic metal stick.  That being said, the last time I was home for a visit, my little party of 4 filled up on 6 pitchers of sangria....YUM-O-LA.
