Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I am ready to drop by again and try something other than the Lou Malnati Special.  Some of the other pies looked great but it never hurts to try a tried and true.  The portion of the pizza closest to the crust tasted perfect, piping hot and scrumptious.  Otherwise, the third of the pie towards the center was a different story.  Regardless, I'd still drop by again and give it one more shot.
