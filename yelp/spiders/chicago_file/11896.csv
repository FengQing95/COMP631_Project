Art Institute of Chicago////Some'thang new -- I Spyed something intriguing during my visit. A HYDE PARK ART CENTER's delicacy!! An Episodic - Twentieth Century Arts with the cursory of Ballpoint pens and Colored pencils by yours truly, Jim Falconer/Jim Nutt: "Hairy Who" that encapsulated the comic book and mysterious features on paper!! Very Different...a curious stare for me...their art work was on exhibit the entire month of December!!
