Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For the most part, I really enjoyed it. It didn't "WOW" me as much as other pizza experiences. One of my friends described it as a "glorified pizza hut." This was quite the slap in the face. I could kind of see where she was coming from, but don't listen to her. I won't mention her name for fear of abuse on yelp from all of you. Anyways, after I ordered, I found out there was a "BUTTER CRUST" that I didn't order. Apparently that is the thing to get. DS&* DF(*ER F(UREORJ...F***, S***...I can't believe I didn't get THEE crust. Whatever, I had to accept it.
