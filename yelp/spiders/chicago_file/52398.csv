Smoque BBQ////I don't know why it took me so long to try this place out... you need to look no more for great BBQ! Smoque BBQ is the place. I had the full slab of baby backs with the slaw, fries and beans... awesome! It's exactly what I expected and more. I really appreciated that the BBQ sauce was on the side and not hiding the beautifully cooked ribs...they call it "low and slow" here at Smoque BBQ. It makes my mouth water just thinking about it. The order came with 2 servings of BBQ sauce and I used one with a couple of dashes of hot sauce, the other I left alone to compare... excellent balance of heat and smoke. Smoque BBQ is definitely in the "going-back-here" category!
