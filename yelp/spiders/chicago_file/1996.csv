Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This was a great breakfast joint. My three friends and I all ordered different meals, all were tasty, unique and well priced. The service was average and price was reasonable for the quality of food. The location beside Millennial Park was ideal for any tourist in Chicago looking to visit the bean before or after brunch.
