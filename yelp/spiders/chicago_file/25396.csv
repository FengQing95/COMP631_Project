Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I HAVE NO PICS CUZ WE NEVER GOT A PIZZA!! I would give this place a zero if possible. Arrived around 8:00, a bit of confusion as to where to check in for a table for 2, and preorder etc. 1:15 wait, ok. Seated around 9:15, ordered a salad and told pizza would arrive in 15 mins. Salad arrives but 45 mins later the manager comes to the table and says computer was down, pizza will be done in 25-30 mins! WHAT?!! It's now 2 hours since we walked in the door and all we've had are salads at 10:30PM?!! Forget it!! NEVER AGAIN!!Too big for their britches...they really couldn't give a crap.
