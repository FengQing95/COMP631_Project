Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My go-to tapas place in Chicago. I can honestly say Ive been here over 10 times in the past year. The staff is great, the service is good, the only complaint I have is the wait-but thats a good sign, right? We usually make reservations before we come here to avoid the long wait, or come during off hours, but sometimes we still end up waiting. Happy hour here is also wonderful- at the bar, $3 select tapas.
