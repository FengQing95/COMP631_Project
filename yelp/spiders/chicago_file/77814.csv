Little Goat Diner////+ Crab Dip - The dip wasn't bad flavor-wise (arguably the best thing we got here) but even though the dish was hot, the dip inside was still cold. It was definitely full of crabmeat and was tasty, but it would've been exponentially better if it had been warm. The crackers on the side were basically Ritz crackers - very uniform and buttery. The waitress kindly offered us a second batch of crackers when she noticed that we were low, but the second batch was all super crumbly and fragile; they all broke immediately when we tried to dip them.
