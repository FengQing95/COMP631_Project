Art Institute of Chicago////What's to decide?  You should not only go but become a member and load the card on your phone. It allows you to skip the ticket line and see the special exhibits early and hang out in the members lounge by the courtyard.  You can show your visiting friends the best time easily. The special exhibits are the best.  Chicago and Monet and the Van Gogh bedrooms (yes, there were three!) were stupendous. More to come I'm sure.
