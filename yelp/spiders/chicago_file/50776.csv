Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////While the food was excellent and with great taste, we were a little disappointed by the experience. We were seated at a table right next to the bathrooms and I constantly found myself drawing my chair back and forth to let people pass. The small plate (tapas) experience is indeed unique. Perhaps I'm just too used to the conventional style of dining (starter, main, dessert), but for me, I wasn't a fan of getting each small plate spaced out 5-10 minutes apart. Two tapas plates would show up, followed by a Pintxo ("starter") plate, then a 10-minute wait before another plate. Just seems oddly spaced out. Due to the portion sizes, I just found myself wanting all the plates at once.
