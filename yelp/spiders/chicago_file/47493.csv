Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Really great tapas restaurant with a variety of food options. The roast dates wrapped in apple and bacon was awesome and you can't go wrong with the grilled asparagus with Manchego cheese! Â Drinks were pretty good too. It definitely gets crowded, had to sit at the bar due to the wait.
