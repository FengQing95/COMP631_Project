Little Goat Diner////Me & my hubs were looking for a new brunch spot in the city and stumbled upon little goat. The ambiance is great, we waited less than 25 mins to be seated on a Sunday around 1pm. Their brunch menu has lots of options I ordered everything is everything crumpets - the first bite or two were yum, the more I ate I started feeling sick - the salmon was SO salty and lox was pretty greasy. The combined combo left me with a not so good after taste.
