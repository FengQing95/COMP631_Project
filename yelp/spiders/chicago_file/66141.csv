Smoque BBQ////I don't think this place ever has a slow night. Taste the food and you'll know why packed tables are the norm. Everything is delicious. The brisket, pulled pork sandwich and brisket chili are my favorites. Heads up, the Mac n cheese and peach cobbler come in smaller portions than most Americans are used to. I'm usually so full that anything larger than the peach cobbler would be too much.
