Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Now, this is more of what I imagined a deep dish should be. The crust was crispy and light, the meat covered the pizza, the cheese is nice and gooey, and the pizza sauce envelopes the pizza just right. My only suggestion is for you to ask some fresh basil in your pizza - I wish I had done that since after the first few bites, my palette wished for something fresh and light to cut through all that cheese and meat and sauce - ya know, something that brightens up your chew.
