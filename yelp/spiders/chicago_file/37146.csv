Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Visited "Bavettes Old Fashion, Wedge, Mashed Potatoes" - get rid of the Beef, (or the way they spell it) if the signature dry aged rib eye is SUBpar as we DIDN'T enjoy last night.  The drinks, salad, sides and service were top notch but steak was tough and dry.  SO disappointed.  With about a gazillion Chicago Steak Houses (within just a few blocks) hope this "name change" suggestion allows them to stay open.
