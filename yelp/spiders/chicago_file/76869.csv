Little Goat Diner////I highly recommend trying Little Goat Diner if you're in Chicago. We ordered the Crisp Shrimp Cocktail, Sloppy Goat, Pork Torta, The Fattoush, Okonomiyaki, and two Iced Dirty Chais. Our server advised us that this was a lot of food, but as hotel guests, we planned on having delicious leftovers in our room.
