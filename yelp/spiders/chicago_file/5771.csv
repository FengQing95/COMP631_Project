The Purple Pig////We had a fantastic time here.  Long wait but put our name in and returned when we received the message.  The service was great!  He had pork belly- which was phenomenal.  The shank was delicious.  They even made me Parmesan fries - off the menu.  Definitely try this place .  Hope we return.
