Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered delivery so not sure if that affected the quality of the pizza (it shouldn't but I am not a deep dish pizza expert). First the delivery charge for a 5 block delivery was $4.00 that is insane. The pizza was alright nothing special or delicious about it. I was not impressed - since this is a chicago staple, that is why I tried it.
