Little Goat Diner////YUM....just yum. This place is great, I have yet to have a bad meal.  Service is excellent.  My only complaint is that they look my favorite thing off the menu.....Stephanie, please, please, please bring back the bbq pulled pork!!!  It's so damn good!!!  Tred the crispy pork belly this last time last week and it didn't disappoint!!  Mac and cheese is the bomb too!!
