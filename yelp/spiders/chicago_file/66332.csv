Little Goat Diner////I loved the food, cocktails, and gluten-free menu. I was a bit annoyed that after ordering something from the gluten-free menu, the wait staff asked if I was just sensitive or celiacs. When I said sensitive, she said the kitchen likes to know, to be sure the customer "won't die." I found this annoying and a bit rude, as well as uneducated. You can't tell how someone is affected based on the boxes "sensitive" or "celiacs".  I personally know celiacs, diagnosed by a medical doctor, who won't die if they eat gluten, but they will get a terrible upset stomach. I also know sensitive people who won't die either  but they suffer from headaches, acne, digestive problems, joint pain, sometimes after just eating a little bit of gluten. And while not deadly, these symptoms are uncomfortable. I think instead of trying to pry into my personal health, she should have just informed me about what "gluten free" means on their menu, i.e., cross contamination, etc. I think the beauty of having a gluten-free menu should be that I'm not having to explain myself. Other than that, I loved the food, the menu, and everything. I will be back!
