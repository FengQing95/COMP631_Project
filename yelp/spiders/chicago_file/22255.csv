Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We visited on a Saturday around lunch time and I am glad that we did because the place kept getting busier and busier. Our original plan was to go for dinner so this worked out much better since we didn't have to wait for a table. Service was excellent, we actually had two because one was in training and both were fantastic.
