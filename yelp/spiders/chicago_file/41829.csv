Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Erm...more like Cafe Blah Blah Ree Blah. Been here a few times and still cannot get over what the hype is about. Maybe because i'm a spoiled die hard Iberico fan, but I feel like everything is overpriced and not as many selections as Iberico. I simply don't understand what is so great about it. Yes the bacon wrapped dates are delicious, but to me if you want good cheap tapas, Iberico wins this war.
