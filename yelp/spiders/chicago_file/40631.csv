Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////one of the better tapas restaurants in chicago! they have fantastic sangrias there and their tapas are GREAT! i loved thier pinxtos deals where it's cheaper everything! great place to go if you haven't had a decent tapas experience. parking is still a pain because it's in a busy neighborhood, but once you can get there, it's a very fun experience for you and your palate.
