Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went yesterday night with my coworkers and omg was this place amazing! The Brussels sprout salad, the spicy potatoes, the bread., the dates!!! .. everything we had was so delicious. I would def have to try a paella next time! This was the place I've only heard great things about, and yesterday was my first time here. My new fav spot! Already planning on returning with some friends! Also the sangria was amazing. We tried like 3 flavors. And customer service was stellar!
