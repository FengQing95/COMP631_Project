Little Goat Diner////Why would I talk about a bathroom? Because like it or not, the state of a restaurant's bathroom says a lot about their cleanliness as a restaurant overall. I am pleased to say that it's great; bathroom is clean, smells good, and is stocked with plenty of toilet paper. Basics, but important ones. Additionally, they have 5 options: one men's, one women's, and three that just say restroom (which is sneakily progressive and fabulous). The women's has a changing station, and so does the men's!
