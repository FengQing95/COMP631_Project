Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Terrible experience...waited an hour and a half just to get a table the host was rude talked to customers like we were stupid had no respect or even cared about people having to wait out on the rain...mediocre, pizza could've had the same at pizza hut for a ten minute wait. Avoid if possible.
