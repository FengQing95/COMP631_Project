Art Institute of Chicago////The museum space itself is very nice. The layout is not the most intuitive, but the map provided in the visitors' guide is very useful. I also shelled out the money for the audio guide. It was decent, but I wish there had been more things to listen to. Still, it provides some information that you couldn't really get just from reading the little placards in the exhibits.
