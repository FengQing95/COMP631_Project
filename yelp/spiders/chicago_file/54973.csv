Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I came here with a large group on a Thursday night, and this place was packed. There's a cute courtyard with outdoor seating near the front of the restaurant in addition to the large dining space inside. We started off with a couple of pitchers of the classic red sangria which was delicious and not overly sweet.
