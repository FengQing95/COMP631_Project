Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////also love the atmosphere.  usually busy recommend always calling ahead to make a reservation.  i can't wait for the patio to open up, such a lovely place.  i think this place is perfect for after work with coworkers, a date, and also if you want to enjoy the weather and enjoy great food with a close friend :)
