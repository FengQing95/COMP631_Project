Art Institute of Chicago////Lastly we went up to the Modern American exhibit on the second floor and spent around 45 mins in just 2 rooms up there. There was so much more to see! It was massive and just as awesome as the European one. I wish we had more time there, but we did see a few highlights by Georgia O'Keefe and others artists. Very interesting how different the American artists were vs European artists during the same time periods.
