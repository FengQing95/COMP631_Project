Smoque BBQ////I had been here years ago but recently returned with my husband who is now obsessed with this place.  We both ordered brisket sandwiches.  We were feeling gluttonous and were curious, so we both also got one side and a "taste" portion of something else.  We got fries, mac n' cheese, a taste of the St. Louis ribs and a taste of the Texas sausage.  All was amazing.  I am NOT a big fan of ribs but they were phenomenal- just the right amount of sauce and not too much fat...  Yum.  The mac n' cheese is very very good, so are the fries.
