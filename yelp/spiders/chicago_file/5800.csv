The Purple Pig////The first thing we noticed right away was how noisy and crowded the place was. There are only 2-4 table seating at an outside enclosed patio. Inside, the same, 2-4 table seating and then a large communal table. They sat us at the communal table with tall, unstable and wobbly barstools. You're practically sitting elbow to elbow with the person next to you. Same goes for the table seatings. Not my favorite way to dine. You have those awkward moments where you try not to look at the other patrons.
