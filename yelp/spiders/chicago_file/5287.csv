The Purple Pig////Booked a late reservation here for my 30th birthday. A group of my closest friends and I My first time in the city and this restaurant was recommended by more than one person, so I was excited to give it a try. My party was caught up on the red line getting to the restaurant and had trouble finding the entrance. The host on the phone informed me, "well, you're running late. We stop serving exactly at 10pm, so I don't know what to tell you."
