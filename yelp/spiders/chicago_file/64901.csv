Smoque BBQ////The way Smoque distinguishes itself can be felt through their brisket. While most brisket is either 1.) bland or 2.) drowned in sauce to replace flavor, Smoque manages to cultivate flavor organically through their cooking process. Their cooking process leaves a delightfully smokey flavor, and a moistness that is unmatched anywhere else in Chicago. Overall, Smoque is a great value for its slightly high price.
