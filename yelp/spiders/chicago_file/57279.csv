Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////ROASTED CHICKEN EMPANADA - Good. This empanada was pretty decent. It wasn't as good as other empanada places I have been to but it wasn't horrible. The shell was a little different than most we have tried. It was more of a flaky crust rather than a pie shell type of crust. The filling was good. It was seasoned and the chicken was nice and tender. It also came with a cream sauce that added another little pinch of flavor.
