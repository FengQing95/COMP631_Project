Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////With a stroke of luck, my better half scored two seats at the bar. Â We very happily placed our order for a small deep dish pizza with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms, an order of calamari, and the Malnati Salad which had lettuce, crisp salami that was the consistency of crispy bacon bits, mushrooms, black olives, blue cheese crumbles with a slightly sweet vinaigrette.
