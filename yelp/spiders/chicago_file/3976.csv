The Purple Pig////Milk fed suckling pork belly - To me this dish felt like 3 different meats in one. You had super fatty pieces of pork belly, then an in between texture that looked like a piece of neck or something, then finally a more lean cut of meat. It was covered in a peppery, creamy sauce that reminded me of country gravy.
