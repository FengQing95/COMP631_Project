Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Wildberry is by far my favorite breakfast spot period. They have a great menu selection and wonderful service. I love their skillets/omelets and DELICIOUS pancakes! They have a prime location downtown close to some tourist attractions, so yes, you may encounter some tourists there, but this is Chicago so you should be used to that by now. That would never deter me from devouring a mouth-watering Mexicana skillet or the scrumptious Berry bliss pancakes with fresh-squeezed OJ and hot coffee! I used to frequent the Libertyville location and was thrilled when I heard they were opening up a Chicago location. This place gets busy so I would recommend coming at an off-peak time otherwise be prepared to wait. It will be worth it.
