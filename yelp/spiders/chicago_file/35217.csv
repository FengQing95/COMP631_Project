Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I have eaten steak all over the US and elsewhere, including Argentina. This was, by far, the most delicious steak I have ever had. And really, what does it matter that you are dropping $50 on a steak when you are well into your 4th glass of wine? It doesn't matter. In fact, at that point, nothing matters but the food, wine, and ambiance.
