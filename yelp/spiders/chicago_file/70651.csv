Little Goat Diner////We came to The Little Goat rooftop diner to start our July 4th celebration. The menu is limited to four items, I'm not sure if that is for the holiday or full time. My husband and I ordered the Lots of Layers dip, the Korean dog and the pork kabobs. The dip was tasty and creamy but not really my favorite. The pork kabobs were amazing. A nice soy based with grilled pineapple and other veggies. The hot dog has kimchi and fried onions, it was really good. The servers are attentive without being intrusive. The roof top is an amazing space, I highly recommend it.
