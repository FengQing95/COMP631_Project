Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////First off, this place is crazy packed! But for good reason. Make reservations way ahead of time or good luck. The wait for two on a Saturday night was 2.5hr! But you can get full service at the first come, first serve bar areas or high tops which is what my girl and I did. The service is quick and efficient!
