Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Went to dinner for a birthday and had such an amazing time. I told the hostess that we were celebrating a birthday and from the second we walked in every single person we interacted with said happy birthday and really meant it. Our waitress, Amy I believe, was absolutley incredible. So knowledgable, amazing recommendations and just very sweet all around.
