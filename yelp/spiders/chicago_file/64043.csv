Smoque BBQ////Coleslaw: I grew up seeing my parents eat KFC coleslaw and having tried it once, completely turned me off from it. Smoque BBQ's coleslaw was surprisingly good. I ended up combining it with the brisket and the contrasting flavors blended well. Apparently this is how they do it in the South? Maybe I'm wrong, but it was delicious.
