Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////First of all, I have been coming here for tapas for the last 7 years. This is the only place I come for tapas and a couple of weeks ago my family and I had dinner there on a Monday evening to celebrate my birthday. The food was excellent but our server was horrible.  I was so embarrassed.  The place was not too busy. He came to our table when we were seated and causally asked if we were ready and my sister put in the seafood paella since it takes a while to serve. We got our sangria but he never smiled. He was arrogant and not warm. He kept coming to our table to put in our order. Very pushy and he seemed very irritated. Then we put in our desserts and my sister requested a surprise candle on the flan she ordered for me. He just brought it out and left it on the table and walked away. When my family was ready to pay he came picked up the payment came back and said thank you and that was it. We spent almost $400.00 that night. I mean what kind of service is this??? Sloppy and inattentive. Management should look into this and retrain their wait staff.  I've been in the hospitality business for 3 decades. Unfortunately I won't be coming back here with family and friends. Was not impressed at all. I will be searching for a new tapas place. Chicago has a wide variety of restaurants. Just very lousy service here too bad.
