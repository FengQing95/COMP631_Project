The Purple Pig////They also have an extensive wine list, charcuterie options, and a short beer list. The only thing that I'd give lower than 5 stars for was the ambiance. Since it's located in an office building, some parts of the restaurant feel less comfortable and welcoming than others. Ask to be seated closer to the back of the restaurant- away from the glass windows that look out into the lobby.
