Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's, like all of Brendan Sodikoff's joints, is dimly lit with old school decor to make you feel like you stepped back in time.  It sets an appropriate tone for the menu, which has a solid old school feel, almost more so than the Next Chicago steak menu.  It's a place we had been meaning to check out for awhile, and I'm glad we finally got around to checking it out.
