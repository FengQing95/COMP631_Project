Art Institute of Chicago////Wow, really horrible customer service. This is a CityPass stop and a crowded one at that. So we get there and have a pleasant experience at the front desk with the CityPass concierge and get our passes, he then tells us to go straight to the fast pass line to go straight in, good for me, right? No. The lady at the ticket desk is talking loudly and cursing on her cell phone and mumbles that we need to check our bags and coats, so I walked to the other side of the lobby and wait in the coat check line for at least 20 minutes, the guy then tells me that it's $1 cash to check a bag or coat, which is pretty insulting considering I just bought four CityPasses (which promised me I didn't have to stand in ANY lines) so the guy rudely told me that I would have to stand in a ticket line to get a voucher where I could use a credit card. (They take credit cards on one side of the room, but not the other... makes sense, right? It's 2016.) So as I walked out of like the female employee mumbles that "people were really testing her patience today" so that set me over the edge. Quit if you can't work at an fine art museum taking coats, shouldn't be that hard. So I went and got a voucher and stood back in line and handed them all of my bags and coats and finally got to see the rest of the museum, which is very nice but the horrible customer service all detracts from that. What a shame.
