Art Institute of Chicago////Probably my favorite art gallery in all of this United States. It is home to my favorite painting in all of this entire world, "Nighthawks" by Edward Hopper. This painting alone is worth the entire price of admission, and the time and travel to get here to the Windy City! In the next room over, there is, of course the equally as iconic, "American Gothic", Grant Wood's fine portrait of the supposed farmer and his wife and the pitchfork between them, just breath-taking in person, as you stand there. I Love this museum. I just LOVE it! I could spend hours here in a day, and I have. I hope to bring my children here one day, so they may see these amazing works of art, all under one roof! And also enjoy one of America's greatest cities: Chicago!
