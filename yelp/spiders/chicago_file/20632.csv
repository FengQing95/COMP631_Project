Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza was very good. The cheese was fantastic and the sauce was great but there wasn't enough of it in my opinion. I wasn't happy with the way the sauce didn't taste fresh and it didn't taste like fresh tomatoes even though there were huge chunks. We opted for the Classic Chicago deep dish stuffed pizza. I ordered from the hotel BEFORE we arrived at the restaurant to make the wait shorter, we arrived, clearly the order had been submitted but we still waited 35 minutes. Our server was "meh" at best and when I had to ask him about my order that was placed BEFORE we got there...he realized we had been waiting a long time but never checked on anything until I asked. Customer service was pretty lousy but the pizza was very good. NOT great but very good.
