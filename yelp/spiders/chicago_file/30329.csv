Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Personally, I'm not a huge fan of deep dish, so my review is going to be at least slightly biased. This place gets extremely packed, so do not go if you are hungry already. They allowed us to put our name down and call/text us when our table was ready so we could go to a bar nearby to wait. We got summoned back to the restaurant, and we had to wait an additional half an hour after we got back, because they said there was a mix up with our table not actually being ready (we think they gave our table away). After we were seated we ordered some beers, calamari and pasta. Everything was had was pretty good, no complaints on the food. Although I'm not a deep dish fan, I did enjoy the pizza here. Overall I had a decent experience and I'm glad to have tried this place after so many high recommendations. I think the one visit has satisfied my curiosity.
