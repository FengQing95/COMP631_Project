Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Update:  I recently went because they offer a crustless pizza made with sausage as the crust.  I figured that the worst part of their pizza is the crust, so take that out and maybe it's not too bad.  The cheese reminded me at times like there was American cheese in it too, like how it was when we were kids and made those silly pizza kits.  It was still pretty good.  But for a large 2 topping it was $26.  So wowsa, not cheap at all. (We went and picked it up.... the place was overran with tourists.  I also thought it funny that they were sitting people outside when it was raining.  When I walked in it was raining but a downpour was on it's way... Groups would walk in, they'd ask "first available" (as in, do you want inside or outside? and of course everyone would say yes... because why not sit in the rain if it means you're eating faster? hmm!
