Smoque BBQ////BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it's always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!
