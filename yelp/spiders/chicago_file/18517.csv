Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////One of, if not the most famous, deep dish pizza joints in Chicago. I could sit here and tell you about the ambience of the restaurant; but, I'm not. Just know you'll feel comfortable when you first walk in. I actually ended up sitting outside to enjoy the beautiful anyway nahmsayin? To the point tho. I came to the Chi for the sole purpose of eatin some authentic Chicago Deep dish pizza and that's what the gawd did. I'm not one of these cats that try and break down the texture of crust n pepperoni n ish; or the robustness of the tomatoes. If the food is good then no need to put it to a science yo. With that said your boy opted for the deep dish pepperoni and I'll say this, I approve. I got the 9" because I got the build of a king so a king size portion is what I'll take. I've had deep dish from other places outside Chicago and I must say I'm happy I took the trip. The pepperoni spicy, the tomato sauce choonkie, the cheese mad cheesy, and my favorite part the crust perfectly crisp on the edges and chewy on the inside. On some real ish tho your boy was reconsidering getting a 9" (wild pause) because I was ready to tap by the 3rd slice. I came on and empty stomach and still almost had trouble finishing. Needles to say I'm no quitter and handled my thug thizzle like a true g. If you like white iPhones n ish or enjoy ballads by Drake then they got a 6" that might satisfy your personal needs too. Overall this place is great; it could get a five star review, but; my experience with deep dish is kinda limited ya know? They also have a full menu with all types of Italian dishes that looked appetizing but I ain't go there for that. If you ever in Chi Town and want an authentic deep dish experience check out Lou Malnati. Aight oneski
