Little Goat Diner////Stephanie's done it again. I loved this place. The best part is they serve breakfast all day. My one complaint is that the service was quite slow. My party allowed two hours for our early 4pm dinner, and almost didnt make it out of there by 6pm. Other than that, the drinks were good (but very overpriced), but the food was reasonably priced for what you get. I had the Fat Elvis Waffles which come with bacon maple syrup (amazing) and peanut butter butter. Thats right, Stephanie has managed to concoct butter made out of peanut butter.
