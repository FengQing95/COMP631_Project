Little Goat Diner////I cannot even begin to explain how aMMMMazing this food is. Upon first bite it  put our regular diner to shame. I can't explain my boyfriends opinion of the "Brandade & Belly Benedict" but I took the silence and the MMMM's and Ahh's as a good sign. My  "Bulls Eye French Toast" was exactly that. It was dead on the bulls eye! It was a dance of flavors upon my tongue which I had never experienced before. There was sweet, and there was zesty. There was smoky, and then there was a little tart. The textures were incredible. The bread was so fluffy on the inside, yet firm on the crust. At first I thought I was eating cake. I wasn't. This was better than cake. There was crunch and then there was smooth.
