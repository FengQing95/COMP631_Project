Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Despite nothing about a deep dish seemed like a good idea to us, my husband and I couldn't let ourselves leave the city without giving one a try. We chose Lou's for its consistently positive reviews. We came in for an early dinner with two friends and shared a medium sized Malnati's special.
