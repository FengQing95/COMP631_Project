Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My man-friend and I had heard about this place from our hotel's concierge when asking for some recommendations around the city and we were not disappointed! We walked in with no reservations and sat up at the bar. The place itself is super sexy and old-school, almost like a dark speakeasy on the inside. It seems like you've stepped back in time because there are candles everywhere and it's got such a vibrant, almost sepia-toned aesthetic. As for service, the bartenders could not have been friendlier! I wish that I could remember their names, there was an extremely sweet guy and an awesome chick with great bangs who were working there when we dined. Just a quick shout out, you were both awesome!!!
