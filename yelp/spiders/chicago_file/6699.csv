The Purple Pig////As another note, the service was very good. My sister is allergic to nuts and we liked that our server asked about whether it was a contamination or ingestion allergy so that the kitchen understands. Our server was also knowledgeable of the menu - she recommended us the burrata, the broccoli, and mushroom capellacci dishes, all of which turned out to be great! I would love to return and try more of their other vegetarian offerings as well.
