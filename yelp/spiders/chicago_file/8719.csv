Art Institute of Chicago////If you are able, pay the extra $5 for the Van Gough exhibit, it is worth the money,  The exhibit is well organized and I was amazed at how close you could walk up to the pieces.  The line to the Van Gough exhibit was long, 30 to 40 min, and it was entirely too crowded once admitted, but I noticed the line was much shorter around the noon hour.
