Smoque BBQ////Two things to preface: 1) I love BBQ and, as a result, have a pretty low threshold for a 5-star review; 2) My favorite BBQ in Chicago (and that of many other Yelpers) is Green Street Smoked Meats, so I'm going to (potentially unfairly) write this review in this context. Overall, Green Street has better sides and a better non-food experience; Smoque has better meat and better price points. But both are *amazing* and you cannot go wrong with either.
