Art Institute of Chicago////My main intention was to find Salvador Dali, he's long been my favorite artist and being close to his work sent me into a sublime, dreamy reverie, until I was snatched back to reality, since my ear drums were pierced with the braying laughter and crude mocking of the exhibit by some tourists. Go home and play your Garth Brooks records if you hate art so much, crass philistines.
