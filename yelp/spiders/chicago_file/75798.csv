Little Goat Diner////What a cute yummy place! We came here for dinner, where I had breakfast (the chicken 'n waffles), and then for breakfast, where I had dinner (goat loco moco). The waffles with strawberries was slightly overly sweet for me, but the chicken that went on top was so juicy and perfectly cooked! I love love loved the loco moco. The entire dish - with the greens, the rice, and the other stuff. The flavor profiles just meshed so well together. That ground goat meat patty was perfect! Ask for it medium-rare, not well done, and it will be so much better!
