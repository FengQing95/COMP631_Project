Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ahh, variety, it's the spice of life.  It could also be the bane of existence for any person that struggles to make a decision.  I'm not talking about which iPhone color to get; I'm just talking about dinner for tonight.  I guess you could say that tapas answers that burning question of what to pick by allowing you to indulge in multiple plates as if you had a personal line to the kitchen.
