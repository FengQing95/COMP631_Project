Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////All of the food was great, but what really maximized my experience here was our fabulous service. Like I said, we sat in the bar because it didn't look very busy... except what I didn't notice was that the bar wraps around and has tables on the other side as well. At one point the bartender, Luis, had an almost completely full bar and all the bar tables all by himself and we never once longed for anything. He was well versed on the menu, fast, friendly, and very attentive. At one point I accidentally spilled my drink (obviously my fault) and before I could even order another one he had already replaced it for me at no extra charge (greatly appreciated, but totally unnecessary)
