Little Goat Diner////For dinner I had the pork belly pancake and it was exceptionally delicious - I wish I had a pork belly pancake right now actually!!!  My friends both had the los drowned sandwich and said they were really happy with their choice.  We split a side of tempura mashed potatoes and, while they were not at all what I expected, they were very good. We also, split the 'not Chinese broccoli' and the smoked fries.  I was not a fan of the fries but the broccoli was very flavorful (***caveat, I am a terrible judge of French fries as I am not fond of them to start with so consider that while weighing my French fry opinion).
