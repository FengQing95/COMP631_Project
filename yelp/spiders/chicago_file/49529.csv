Smoque BBQ////the best bbq i've ever had in my 30 years of existence.  maybe it's cuz i'm from LA where bbq isn't as big of a thing as it is in the midwest?  who knows but i went twice in two weeks because i couldn't get those ribs and brisket out of my mind!!!  i tried both the baby back and st. louis style ribs.  i couldn't totally tell the difference between the two but i didn't care because they were both just so good.  and the brisket...melt in your mouth deliciousness!!!!!  what i loved was that all the sauces were on the side, not overslathered on the ribs.  the peach cobbler is a must have.  MUST have!  i wasn't the biggest fan of their cole slaw but soon realized it helps out to have a light veggie side in the midst of all that meat!
