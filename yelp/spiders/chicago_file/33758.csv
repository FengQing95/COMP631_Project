Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Finally, for dessert we had the chocolate creme pie, with oreo crust.. mmmmm..... let me warn you, it's very rich. So if you're a big chocolate fan, it should be perfect. It came with a huge dollop of whipped cream on top, which helped lighten the chocolate in each bite, perfect for someone like me who can only do so much chocolate before getting sugared-out.
