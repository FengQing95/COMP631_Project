Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We also shared some paella! Note: order this at the beginning of your meal/when you know you want it because it takes about 20 minutes to happen. We opted for 2 portions of the paella mixta which had sausage and chicken thighs in it (they have a 2 portion minimum for paella). It was definitely enough food for 4 people after 5 shared tapas. It was enough for a small plate each, but the highlight was them mixing it at the table! The rice was well seasoned, but I like a bit more stuff-to-rice than I got (too much rice, not enough stuff). We finished our meal with a couple espressos for the boys, and my friend and I split a small dessert (free with yelp check-in!!!). We had the blueberry compote and goat milk ice cream which was a nice light way to finish off the meal.
