Smoque BBQ////I'm rather shocked at how overrated this place is. Tried it one Saturday before it got crowded and was not pleased. The pulled pork was good. The BBQ-sauce (the one made with Coca-Cola) was just not there. Briscuit was tough and not much flavor. Mac and cheese was a joke and the cole-slaw was bad. Why people wait outside in line to eat here is beyond me. Does anyone know a good, reasonably priced bbq place is in the city? And yes I will drive to the South Side.
