Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food was amazing, the service was on point, and the sangria was delicious. The server gave recommendations that we followed for about half the ordered food and he was spot on. I am not a person that likes fruit in food typically but the bacon wrapped dates are a must try. When ordering the Sangria, I would say go for the full pitcher. It is so delicious that you will most certainly want at least two glasses.
