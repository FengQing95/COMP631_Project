Little Goat Diner////First time diner. Ordered a party melt and fries. The fries were soft and limp and the patty melt was raw. I left the fries completely untouched and 3/4s of my patty melt torn up and uneaten. My server didn't ask me if I didn't like anything or what the issue was and took my food away and threw it out. I wish I had a different server and someone else to cook my food. The space is cool though just sucks that all the services they provide isn't worth going back.
