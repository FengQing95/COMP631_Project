Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Stopped by here on our trip in from LA because almost every local we talked to said we had to try Lou's for deep dish.  We went for lunch and got sat right away, it wasn't too busy.  We got the buffalo wings which were incredibly tender and delicious and then finished with the Classic Lou's deep dish and it was great.  The crust is buttery and crunchy and has a ton of flavor.  The service was pretty slow (not the food, I know deep dish takes awhile to cook) server was nice but only came by to take our order and drop the bill never saw him in between.  Overall a good experience and would definitely recommend.
