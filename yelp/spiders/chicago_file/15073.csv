Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I love this place! I actually don't even like pizza (I know, I'm weird) but my sister insisted we try deep dish during our first time in Chicago so we ended up here. We ordered the Lou and O-M-G! The Parmesan crust had me craving this pizza for days! Three kinds of cheese, spinach, and fresh tomatoes add to the awesomeness.
