Little Goat Diner////A colleague of mine and super Yelper Laura S. was visiting in town for a conference so we had to start with a business breakfast to get caught up just in case we missed each other with the craziness of conference schedules. Where to go with a fellow foodie for a weekday breakfast? Look no further than Little Goat! I had actually not eaten at the diner yet despite being a huge fan of their bread program and enjoying a beer or two at their bar from time to time.
