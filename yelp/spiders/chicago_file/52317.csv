Smoque BBQ////Although the ribs are not my type of ribs that I like, which are fall-off-the-bone tender, all of their other stuff were really good. The brisket is out of this world and the corn bread was delicious. I've tasted better ribs and cole slaw elsewhere and really would not say I would wait so long in line again but would definitely come back with friends if the wait was not long.
