Smoque BBQ////If I could eat at one place for the rest of my life, it would be here. Everything I have tried here is amazing. The sliced brisket plate with Mac and cheese and fries is a must. But the star of the show is the sweet jalapeño. I always ask for 3 cups of these because they are so dang good. The crunch of the jalapeños with the brisket is heaven. I highly highly recommend them. Thank me later.
