Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The deluxe was excellent, though with so many vegetable toppings I couldn't taste the sauce or cheese as much.  Still, the vegetables tasted fresh and crisp, and the sausage had excellent bite to it.  Once again, despite being loaded with toppings, this pie was very light tasting and I swear to you there was not a speck of floating oil in sight and the crust didn't leave your hands covered in grease.  Amazing!
