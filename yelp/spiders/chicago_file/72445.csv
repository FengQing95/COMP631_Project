Little Goat Diner////I am proud to say that I live in Chicago and Chef Stephanie Izard calls Chicago home. I have been here several times different times of the day and Little Goat Diner has not yet let me down. Just last weekend I told Chef Izard I might be a little obsessed with Little Goat Diner. It must be the Fat Elvis Waffles. Kimchee & Bacon & Eggs & Pancakes Asian Style Breakfast, Crumpets with Chorizo Maple Syrup, Smoked Fries, Sloppy Goat Sandwich, Tonkatsu Sandwich, Goat Almighty Burger, Carmel Apple Shakes, Smoked Pork & Toffee Crunch Shakes, and Duck Fat Bread (seriously). Yeah I have had all that and more! You cannot get into Girl & the Goat. Just come here and you will be happy that you did. Average wait during prime dinner hours is over an hour so get here before 5pm. Average wait during prime lunch hours during the week is the same at an hour so get here before 11:30am. If you can, make reservations via Yelp cause life is easier when they have a table waiting for you. If any point you have to wait, go to the Little Goat Bread side and wait. Or if you have to wait for your Girl & the Goat table just swing by. They have a full bar and coffee bar there. As you walk in, the place is a throw back in time. You can see the open kitchen and if you are really lucky see Chef Izard getting into what she does best. Folks that work here are always awesome from the host to the servers. Not only they know their stuff on what's on the menu through and through. They are just cool people even on the busiest days. The food is just awesome. Serving breakfast all day long through late night you can get anything on the menu until they run out. Try the Sloppy Goat Sandwich or Goat Almighty Burger with a side of Smoked Fries. The shakes are stupendous as well including the Smoked Pork & Toffee Crunch Shake. Just close your eyes and try it. You will taste the amazing smoky and sugar toffee crunch of amazingness. If you want a grownup shake, they can make they happen by putting a shot of liquor in any shake you please. Need a caffeine lift? Little Goat Diner is one of a few places in Chicago that serves up Portland's Stumptown Coffee. Make sure you try a cup of The Little Goat - Stumptown Coffee with Goats Milk. In the summer months, outdoor seating opens as well as the roof opens for dining. With Little Goat Diner's seasonal menu, you have to come here a few times a year to really experience Little Goat Diner. Bring your friends, bring a date, or just stop in for a drink. This place has plenty to offer.
