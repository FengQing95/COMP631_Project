Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The good news: Made reservations a month & a half in advance but still had limited options (either really early or really late). Had them put a note in that we'd prefer an earlier time if possible, and ended up getting a time 1/2 hour earlier than our original reservation a day or so in advance--(called us to confirm). Â The server, Michael F., was wonderful, and he made us feel comfortable and welcome. I ordered the avocado crab stuffed salad (should've gotten the dressing on the side), which was actually plenty of food for me; and my dining partner got the steak frites. He is a major steak person and was really impressed. The frites (of course I nabbed a few) were also quite good. We were pleased that it wasn't so dark in Bavette's you couldn't see the menu and that it wasn't so loud you had to shout--(e.g., at Mastro's, sometimes you feel like you have to shout--though Mastro's is great). Everyone around us seemed like they were having a great time, too.
