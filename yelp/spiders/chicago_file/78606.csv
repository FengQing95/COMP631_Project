Little Goat Diner////Service was fantastic and attentive after my order was taken. The Bloody Mary came out first (first time hearing of a Bloody Mary with kimchi). It was a delicious with the spiciness hitting at the end of each sip. This Little Piggy Went to China met my expectations; an awesome take of a Chinese inspired savory breakfast dish (the spices really stood out to me). The french toast was so soft and melt in your mouth, and the breaded chicken on top and egg in the middle was a nice twist. The most mundane item was the fries; there's nothing special or smoky about these smoked fries, but they were great fries in terms of taste and texture nonetheless.
