Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food amazing however the HOSTESSES area different story and we almost walked out and missed the great food. They are not friendly at all. We came in at 5pm on a Monday night without a reservation just 2 of us and they said no problem and there was no wait the place was dead. We wanted to sit in the parlor but they don't open till 530 so we said ok dining room is fine. So she brings us to a table in the middle of the room where everyone walks past to get around the restaurant. So I asked for a booth and she said no we didn't have a reservation and couldn't sit in one. I'm looking around like the place and its empty. So then I said well we will wait for the parlor bc it's a lot more cozy and everyone walking in won't be bumping your table or walking around you. So we waited and 530 hits and we get down there again to another table no booth but it was ok bc it was towards the back. Their just not friendly, or nicely dressed and don't seem to be organized at all. But our waiter was really good and my food was beyond delicious. The bread is the best I've ever had. I will make sure to make a reservation next time just to see if I actually get a booth lol
