Smoque BBQ////Enough about the food.  On this visit it was the service that impressed us.  Of course Barry Sorkin was floating around checking on everyone and lending a hand where needed.  But what really made the difference was that close to the end of our meal, my GF decided to take some brisket to go for her parents.  She barely got in line to place her order where one of the staff came up to her and noted that she already had a meal.  They inquired if she needed something else and when she said that she wanted something to go, he not only took her order but then came to the table for her to pay rather than stand in line.  Suffice to say that these guys not only get BBQ, they understand customer service.  Not bad for a bunch of former IT guys.  Although Chicago can't claim any style of BBQ for ourselves, Smoque has respectfully studied the art and brought it to Chicago.  They run a fine restaurant.  How about a suburban location?!
