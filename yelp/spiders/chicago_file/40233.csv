Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is by far my favorite steakhouse in the US! That's right, I said it. Bavette's is the best kept secret in Chicago.. but it's not quite a secret anymore because folks are finding out it's 10x better than Gibson's, Prime&Provisions, etc. Be sure to snag a reservation because walk-ins for 2 will be an hour wait even mid-week. Bar seating is first come first serve though & serves full menu. The atmosphere is swanky historic with very dim lighting; they've got a downstairs parlor with a speakeasy feel too! The service is just top notch too.
