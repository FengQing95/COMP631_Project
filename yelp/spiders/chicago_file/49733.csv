Smoque BBQ////but let me tell you the food is not to found elsewhere in Chicago. Dry rub smoked bbq is hard to find in the city. It has much more tang and zip than traditional wet ribs and it is not sweet and sticky either. The sides are also great. Beans and fries compliment the smoked pork like butter to toast.
