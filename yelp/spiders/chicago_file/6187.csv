The Purple Pig////2. Ambience 10/10: The vibe is a bit more formal and the servers are very attentive and friendly. As a party of one I sat at the bar and it was easy to get the servers' attention. At the same time they tend to squeeze people onto edge of the bar so I noticed some people didn't have much room to eat.
