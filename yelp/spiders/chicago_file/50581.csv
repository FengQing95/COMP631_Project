Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Awesome spot for brunch on the weekend. Not too crowded (around noon on a Saturday) and they've got a wicked DIY bloody mary bar. Cava sangria was good, but I'm not much of a bubbly person so I probably would have opted for one of their other sangrias had my friend not wanted the cava. I ordered a simple dish (two eggs) but reallllllly loved the date-glazed bacon. A definite must, everyone at my table was practically drooling when they saw it. The cinnamon french toast was tasty, and a friend ordered the chorizo, manchego, and veggie omelette which was good and another friend had the egg benedict which was also good.
