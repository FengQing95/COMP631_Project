Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We got the deep dish mushroom with the butter crust, the stuffed spinach bread, and to finish off--the pan chocolate chip cookie. The spinach bread is excellent and comes with marinara sauce for dipping.  What I like most about the pizza was the amount of cheese. It was oozing off, but not in ridiculous amounts.  I think that I will rank Lou's as my #3 favorite  deep dish in Chicago, behind Gino's East and Peqouds (see review below!).
