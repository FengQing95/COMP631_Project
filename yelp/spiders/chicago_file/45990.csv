Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We got the chicken empanadas- one empanada. All mushrooms, which I am allergic to. Warm goat cheese- meh, had better. Short ribs- one rib, probably the greasiest piece of meat that had been sitting around in it's own greasiness I've had in a while. I still shudder to think. The manchengo mashies were good. BF had some shrimp, said they were boiled and gross.
