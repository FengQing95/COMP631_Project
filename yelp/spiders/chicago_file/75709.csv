Little Goat Diner////We made a reservation so I'm not sure how long the regular wait would be. Looking at the menu I was a little apprehensive because the asian/ American diner fusion are so vastly different I didn't know if it was actually tasty or overhyped for its creativity/being the little sister of the Bib Gourmand rated restaurant The Girl & The Goat. Â The Hot Crab Dip is popular so we got that as the appetizer, and the Shrimp and Pork Belly entree. Both were superb. We got these foods because we came for dinner but definitely would like to try their breakfast/other menu items- but based on my experience I think all of their food will be yummy despite how it might read on paper. Service was awesome too! Truly a 5 star experience.
