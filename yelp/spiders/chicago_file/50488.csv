Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My standards for Spanish restaurants remains high because I love Spain--it's where I stopped being a vegetarian because everything smelled so good that I just HAD to eat it. All of it. We spent a week there last year, will be returning this year. Sadly, I don't expect to return to Cafe Ba Ba Reeba on my next visit to Chicago. Maybe it was having the two managers stare and point at my table during what was supposed to be our relaxing final night in Chicago, or maybe it was the food, which is more pan-Mediterranean than Spanish. Hummus? Â The servers, bussers, and rest of the staff remain friendly & efficient--you will not have to worry about not having your water glass refilled or having too much food served at the wrong time instead of in stages. Allergies are taken seriously.
