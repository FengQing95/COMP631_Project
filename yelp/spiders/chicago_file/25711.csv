Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our first appetizers came, we ordered the chicken wings and calamari. Upon asking the man who was refilling our water if the chicken wings had dairy, he said he didn't know. We had to ask him to check for us, or find our waiter. He never returned to our table with an answer.
