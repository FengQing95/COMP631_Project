The Purple Pig////I just stopped by for a quick lunch in their new location just across from the old spot. Service (Hediberto) was great, friendly, efficient and quick. I ordered a corn salad with walnuts and fresh heirloom tomatoes . It was a Perfect lunch: healthy and tasty. I'd come back for sure when i can chow on a great meat dish
