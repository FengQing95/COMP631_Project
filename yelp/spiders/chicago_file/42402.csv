Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ashley was amazing! She helped us with every portion of the party and she bent over backwards to do pretty much anything we asked for. We asked for a specific type of alcohol for a toast, which they don't keep on hand, three or four days before the reception and they not only ordered it, there was no extra charge above the bar package. They also kept the alcohol chilled exactly how we wanted it! They have one of the most reasonable bar packages out there! Everything went off without a hitch and someone was on hand all night providing excellent service!
