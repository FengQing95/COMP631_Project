Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We came to Baba Reba for a Christmas Eve dinner. You have to make reservations to come here because it's packed. The food was amazing! We ordered croquettes, Spanish omelette, avocado toast, steak, sangria, and the lavender cocktail and everything was delicious!! We came with a 4 year old and there were options for her there as well. Our waitress, Corinna, was so sweet and fast and all of our food came out on time. The plating was beautiful also. I would recommend this to anyone!
