Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////In comparing Bavette's, Maude's, and Au Cheval, I'm very torn between Maude's and Bavette's (Au Cheval is the clear loser for me personally).  I absolutely love the speakeasy decor.  Our server was extremely knowledgeable about the wine list.  There were some good values on there but some that were 3x markup.
