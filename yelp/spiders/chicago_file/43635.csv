Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////About 40 of our friends and family were in attendance, and Ba-Ba-Reeba fit us all into one of their dining rooms. Ashly was a fanstastic help in planning everything with us, from the menu to the room lay-out. The food was wonderfu, featuring of course various paellas for the entrees. Appetizers were terrific as well, gallons of tasty sangria were consumed by one and all.
