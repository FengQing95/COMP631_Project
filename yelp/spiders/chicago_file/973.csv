Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Used the waitlist feature on Yelp for the first time and it was definitely well worth it. Waited in the luxury of my home and then was seated immediately at the estimated time it told us to arrive at the venue. Now onto the food - the corned beef skillet was wonderful. Got it with a side of strawberry bliss and buttermilk pancakes to share with my guest. The pancakes were great and paired well with the savory skillet. This in itself would have been plenty of food - but our eyes were a little greedy so we also ordered the chicken and waffles. This item missed the mark which is why this rating is four stars - the waffles weren't very moist and the tenders were a little underwhelming. However, I would come back because the service was great, the pancakes were fantastic, and the skillet was tasty and a great portion. This was Devin itself a good value visit. Also - the unlimited refill flavored lemonades were fantastic. I loved the raspberry and the blackberry!
