Smoque BBQ////THE BEST DEAL is getting a sandwich and fries on the kids menu for like $3.50 if you want a great lunch but don't want to have to take a nap after it... ALSO, it's BYOB which is a nice touch.... lots of folks were bringing in their own beer... makes for an affordable and delicious meal.
