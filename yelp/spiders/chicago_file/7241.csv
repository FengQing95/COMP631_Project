Art Institute of Chicago////This was by far one of the best experiences of my life, along with the Smithsonian. I was at a conference and I scheduled everything around my visit to the Art Institute of Chicago. My strategy to visit Millennium Park and just about every inch of the museum worked out, in record time. The Picassos were the biggest treat for me and I really had to peel myself away from The Old Guitarist, so I could be sure to cram it all in. From the armor to the Native American exhibit, Â they have it all. They even have a great interactive educational area for the kids, which helps make the works of the greats a little more relevant for the kiddies.
