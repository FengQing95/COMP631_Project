Little Goat Diner////Wonderful selection of interesting sandwiches and other fare. The Los Drowned beef sandwich was fantastic. Service was excellent. The waiter was very attentive but not annoying. Definitely recommend sitting outdoors if you can. It was beautiful. Great place for lunch and worth the small wait time.
