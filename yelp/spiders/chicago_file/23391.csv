Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great pizza!  There was a bit of a wait for a table, but it was totally worth it!  My family loved their deep dish pizzas, and my gluten free one was one of the best I've ever had. The crust was fantastic, not one of the cheap frozen ones. Great draft list too. Awesome experience, food, and service!!!
