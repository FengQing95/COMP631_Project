Little Goat Diner////One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. Several unique takes on classics and overall really good food. Great variety to accommodate everyone in your group (and whatever meal you're craving) -- they even have a special gluten-free menu (just ask for it). They also have happy hour deals.
