Art Institute of Chicago////This is the largest art museum in Chicago and is conveniently located right in the downtown, right near the Bean. We came on a Sunday afternoon and there was a medium sized ticket line, but it was less than a 10 minute wait to get in. This place reminded me a lot of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, except slightly smaller.
