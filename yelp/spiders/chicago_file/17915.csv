Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place is not great at all... We went here with a group of 4 and we pre-ordered to get the pizza early . But they never called us or texted us as we waited for ever!! We honestly has to go up there after hour and remind them. They seated us right away but we had to wait another 30min for the pizza. As soon as we God our butter crust double cheese pepperoni pizza we noticed it wasn't in the greatest shape due to some burns. Also while the whole time we were there they gave us no refills and the waiter never showed back to our table. Even when we wanted to pay. I had to get up and go to a random waiter because no one knows we're our waiter was.
