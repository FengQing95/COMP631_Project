Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My girl and I deem this place the creme de la creme of Chicago's deep dish pizza! Yes, it could be arguable since we tried 2 previous deep dish pizza joints, but for us.. this baby is undoubtedly the best. This place have the classic Italian restaurant look from the inside and bunch of sport jersey's of their famous customers. Right from the get go, when we stepped in front of the door, the smell of their fragrant marinara sauce makes you hungry. Their customer service is top knotch because all of their staff are super friendly; it is like walking to an Italian family gathering. It really does feel so homey inside; great place to be food wasted with fam and friends :)
