Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////i was in chicago on business.  the first thing we did when we got off the plan and at the car rental place, was asked the locals where we should go for deep dish.  everyone said you gotta check out lou malnatis.  and, of course, we were not disappointing.  i personally love deep dish - pizza should not be done any other way! and this place has great heaping amount of cheese.
