Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Good if you like Chicago style pizza.  The tomatoes taste really fresh and the rest of the toppings are top notch.  I prefer a non-lasagna-esque pizza however so I'm probably not the best reviewer.  If you end up visiting Chicago and you want a decent pie.. This one is better than the other three I've had in town.
