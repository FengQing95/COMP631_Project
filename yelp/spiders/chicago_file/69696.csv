Little Goat Diner////Service was good, although I felt for the waitress in her purple diner get up. The coffee was quality and the space is very cool. Little Goat Bread is adorable and I left with some tasty bakery treats. But maybe I just wasn't hung over enough to appreciate what was clearly a hangover breakfast...
