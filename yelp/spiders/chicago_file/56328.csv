Smoque BBQ////Smoque BBQ definitely hit the spot.  The place can certainly be termed a dive, but  a great one featured by Guy Fieri on Triple D.  The pulled pork and brisket certainly have experienced some TLC.  The mac n cheese was very good and very cheesy.  I also found the French Fries to be excellent!
