Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////You see, my friends and I weren't as smart and waited in line for about 45 min, then about 10 min until we were called we realized we could place an order beforehand. So in addition to the 45 min, we waited another 30 or so min at the table for the pizza (Lord, give me patience...)
