Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////On to the food: considering the appetizers were predominantly seafood, I cannot comment due to my allergy. However, both my girlfriend and I ordered the Steak Frites medium rare topped with garlic. It was cooked PERFECTLY. The fries were crispy and the steak was flavorful. I was amazed at how cheap it was for the quality. We finished off our dinner with the cheesecake. I could do without the raspberry glaze, but the cheesecake itself was extremely good. My girlfriend went at it like she'd never seen food before.
