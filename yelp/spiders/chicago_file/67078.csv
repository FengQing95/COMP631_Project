Little Goat Diner////There is always a wait, but you can make it fun at Little Goat! There is a coffee/bread area you can get snacks or good coffee. Once you are seated, the menu has endless amazing choices. When in season, I highly suggest the blueberry pancakes & the burrito. The pancakes are incredible, best blueberry pancakes I can say I've ever ever had. The chef of this place is incredible, I PROMISE it's worth the wait!
