Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Everything was very good but I wasn't crazy about how much oil was in everything.  I know oil is part of the cuisine but it seemed overboard.  So I knocked off one star.  Other than that, the food itself was just as good as everyone says it is, and the sangria is bangin.  I'll be crash dieting for the next four days before the weekend.
