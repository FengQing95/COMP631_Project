Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The entire time, we could pretend we were at a speakeasy in Manhattan. The vibe at Bavette's allowed us to do just that. Bavette's is a cross between Gilt Bar and Maude's (Brendan Sodikoff's other successful ventures). We were there at 9pm on a Thursday and the noise level wasn't as high as it always is at Gilt Bar. Our favorite and regular server, Amie, who used to work at Gilt Bar is now the manager at Bavette's. Congrats for the promotion, Aimee! We also recognized several other long-time employees from Gilt Bar who now works at Bavette's. It looks like Bavette's is now staffed with the more experienced employees. I love the dresscode for the bartenders and male servers-- white collared shirts with the sleeves folded up to the elbows, tie, and a vest. Classic and sharp, and the folded sleeves add casualness to it.
