Art Institute of Chicago////Be aware that you will not be able to bring a backpack into the museum. You will also not be able to store your water bottle at the coat check. So if you bring a water bottle, you'll end up having to carry it around and not drink it, because there's no food or water consumption allowed on the museum. Kind of a Catch 22.
