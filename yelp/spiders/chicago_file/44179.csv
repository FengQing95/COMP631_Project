Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I would also highly recommend coming here with a group instead of just one person.  You'll want to try lots of different things, but if it's just you and one other person, that gets expensive (and wasteful, since you probably won't be able to finish each tapa if you're getting quite a few).  My favorite way to do it is to get one of the paella selections and then lots of tapas that everyone can grab from.
