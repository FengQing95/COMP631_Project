Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My favorite place to chow down in the city? Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, of course!! Lincoln Park if full of amazing restaurants and mouth watering food, but Ba-Ba-Reeba is by far my favorite. I'll admit, I'm a tapas snob. I can't help but comparing every dish and every pitcher of sangria to what I ate/drank in Spain. Admittedly, tapas bars in America are all white-washed and made to appeal to the masses. Sure, you're not likely to see too many sardines on the menu (I'm assuming not many would order them anyway) but what they do make, they make very well. So well, in fact, that I have walked 20 minutes through snow to get there - I'm from California, so you know this is a big deal to me!
