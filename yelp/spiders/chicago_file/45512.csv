Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is one of the best tapas places in the entire city. My parents used to come here on dates in high school. I returned for my umpteenth trip to Babareeba a few weeks ago with 2 girlfriends and we decided to try some new things. It also doesn't feel cheesy and overplayed like other LEYE restaurants. It's very unique and I like that about it. The outdoor patio is to die for, I really want to go back in the summer and sit there for drinks.
