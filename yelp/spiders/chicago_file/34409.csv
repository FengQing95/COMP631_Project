Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My sister and I had an outstanding dining experience.  Great martini and Negroni (hefty ). We enjoyed the crab cake and the bone marrow was off the hook!  Our filets were superb; the Brussels sprouts and creamed spinach sides complimented the steak perfectly.  But the service is really what made this meal so enjoyable. My God, they washed our hands twice with lemon and hot towels!!!  (Maybe we were particularly sloppy, who knows, but it was divine.) Being from Northern Cali  we are partial to sourdough but this bread served with the meal was no slouch.   We have nothing bad to say about Bravettes.  In the words of our ex-governor: "We'll be back."
