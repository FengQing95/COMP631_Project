Little Goat Diner////Our server was super friendly - he was very willing to answer our questions, and provided some recommendations of his preferred orders. Many of those in our group actually got the dishes he ordered, including the Smoked Corned Beef Hash with Egg and the Los Drowned. Since I had just eaten, I asked for a dark chocolate sorbet (off the menu item, but I saw it as an ingredient in a milkshake so I asked for it).
