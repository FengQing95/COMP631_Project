Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. I always bring out-of-towners here because I know they'll have a great experience and enjoy amazing food. I have never had a dish here that was bad. My favorites are the spicy potatoes and the bacon wrapped dates. My fiance's favorite is one of the steak dishes.. I believe it's served with gorgonzola? I don't even like beef that much but always enjoy a few bites of his! The sangria is always great, as well. And, if you have room for dessert, they're reasonably priced and always delicious. Service is always top-notch. I've never had any complaints about this restaurant (except maybe the long wait that is inevitable on the weekends!) Have had brunch here, as well, and it's very good. Love spending a couple of hours eating and socializing at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!
