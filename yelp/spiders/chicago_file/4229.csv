The Purple Pig////Okay this is real. I love this place, and it makes me melt inside. You know you're an adult when you eat here. The staff makes me want to work here. They joke, entertain, work, and hustle all at the same time. They introduce you to new wine, drinks, and food you know old enough to try now. My family had a garden, and I hated beets, and I would never eat them. Purple Pig, makes this Pistachio butter, beets, and cheese dish that has me going in circles every time I eat it. The lamb they serve falls off the bone, and makes me want to eat all night. Liked the old location more but with pandemic haven't been there much.
