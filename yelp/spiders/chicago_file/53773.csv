Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We also ordered two sangria pitchers which were both very good. I really liked that they added vodka to the sangria to give it that extra kick. The only advice I'd give regarding the pitchers would be to bump it up with some better fruit than apple. But I understand since their sangria is on tap that the fruit isn't soaking in the sangria to add flavor, it's merely there for garnish.
