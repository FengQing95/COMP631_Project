Smoque BBQ////Finally made it to Smoque last week & this place did not disappoint!  I was warned to get there early and by 5:45pm on a Friday, the line was already forming. I had to wait about 10 minutes to order and was quickly seated.  The staff does a nice job of finding a spot for you to sit, letting you know when you're number is called, and clearing trash away for the next guests.
