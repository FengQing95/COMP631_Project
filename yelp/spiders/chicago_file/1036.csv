Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////It is amazing how many people were waiting in line on a weekend in the morning for brunch. We had to wait for half an hour to be seated. The place is a little cramped but the food was good, and the portion too large. The waffles, pancakes and milkshakes are too good. A little too sweet, but palatable. Don't like the coffee there. A typical diner, with great and fast service and friendly staff.
