Art Institute of Chicago////The Modern Wing, designed by decorated architect Renzo Piano, promises to shine in its design, technology, and green architecture. The Modern Wing employs a sunshade, loosely called the "flying carpet," which will filter daylight into the gallery spaces. This "flying carpet" will save electricity and provide ideal lighting during the day. Interior lighting will adjust as natural light levels change.
