Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This is one of my favorite Chicagoland brunch spots. They serve all the breakfast staples but they have interesting options which I appreciate since I like eating food that I don't cook at home. I love the fig walnut pancakes, and the custom omelets (I always add chipotle). The only downside is the wait on the weekends for brunch and that they don't take reservations.
