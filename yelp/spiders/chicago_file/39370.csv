Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Portions are huge.  But unlike other steakhouses, the gregarious servers don't try to upsell you.  Instead, they explain portion sizes and suggest sharing appetizers, entrees and sides.  And if you do share, it's a really good value, e.g. the $70 steak is $35 per person ... and there might still be steak left to take home.
