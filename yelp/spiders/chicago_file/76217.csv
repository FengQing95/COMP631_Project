Little Goat Diner////This vibe and menu are nothing like the name-sake restaurant, Girl and the Goat. With that said, yes the food is awesome. Yes, the service is great. The menu is very inspired and the premise is just a great meal. It is a diner though, it vibe and menu, so I don't necessarily recommend for dinner.
