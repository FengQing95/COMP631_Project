Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm a sucker for pizza. After a long day walking around downtown, we ended up at Lou's for an early dinner. Though it was near the dinner rush, we were seated almost immediately. We split an individual house salad and a small order of The Lou deep dish. I enjoyed a beer during the wait, and was kind of surprised to see they only had Goose Island products on tap. Seems rather paltry for a pizza place.
