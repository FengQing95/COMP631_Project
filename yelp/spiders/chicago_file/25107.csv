Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////All of their pizzas take a minimum 30 mins no matter if you order a standard or add extra toppings. Which wasn't really a big deal for me, I like knowing my pizza is super fresh but think it's worth a mention so you know. Got just a personal Lou Malnati classic deep dish which is fresh tomatoes and sausage. My wife ordered the Malnati penne which came out in about 12-15 mins.
