Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time in Chicago and of course deep dish pizza was on my list. Lou's was recommended by locals and it didn't disappoint! The buttery deep dish crust and chunky tomato sauce with stringy mozzarella was like no other. First day in the city and I'm having a hard time thinking this place can be topped! Excellent food and customer service!
