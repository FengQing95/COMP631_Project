Art Institute of Chicago////My fave work in this museum is "The Rock" by Peter Blume. On this visit, I discovered the painting was commissioned by Kaufmann for Falling Water to commemorate the Proletariat. A great architect. A great architectural masterpiece. A great piece of artwork. And if you've visited Falling Water, you'll know about the intact rock left unmoved at exactly the right height and distance to sit on in front of the fireplace confirming the absolute genius of Wright. Cheers!
