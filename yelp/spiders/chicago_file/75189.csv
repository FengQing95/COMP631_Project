Little Goat Diner////We received good service at the restaurant but the food was pretty disappointing. Other than the biscuit and gravy, none of us like the food we ordered. The omelette was dried and bland. The meat in Beef Noodle was salty (could only taste soy sauce) but the noodles were bland. The macaroni and cheese and goat cheese fries weren't as good as expected. Chances are we won't come back since there're so many good restaurants in Chicago.
