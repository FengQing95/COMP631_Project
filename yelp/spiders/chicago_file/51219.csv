Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went here for my birthday my beautiful niece and her awesome hubby took the family for some outstanding tapas. Since they have been here before (and we will try just about anything), we let them order. We had pitchers of white sangria and I'm happy to have been able to walk out of there with one foot in front of the other. One tapas was better than the last some of the mouth watering dishes in order of my favorites and it was really hard to place these in order were Bacon-Wrapped Dates, Roasted Chicken Empanada, Beef Tenderloin & Blue Cheese, Garlic Shrimp so good (they give you bread for the table that is really crusty and good also perfect to soop up the garlic oil from the shrimp), we place two orders of the Fried Green Peppers & Coarse Salt some were a little spicy but mostly they were mild. and the Meatballs
