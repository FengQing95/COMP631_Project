Smoque BBQ////My bf had been raving about this place and seeing how the line was almost out the door when he took me there, I had high expectations.  Though the line was long, it moved fairly quickly.  I liked how we were greeted by a nice and smiley cashier.  I decided to order the baby back ribs platter and my bf ordered the brisket a la carte.  Both were moist and tender.  I'm a fan of baby back ribs and I liked how the meat was falling off the bone.  The platter came with slaw and 2 sides.  The slaw was crisp, the fries were tasty and the peach cobbler was delicious.
