Smoque BBQ////The wife noticed plenty of pork sandwiches were still making it out of the prep area. Hmm. . .where did this magical bonus pork appear from? The smoker only holds so much meat, and it bestows its gifts but once a day, and lo it runneth out from time to time, but we decided they post the "gone fishin" signs when the line threatens to test the patience of the neighbors. Or maybe someone in the kitchen is about to stab someone.
