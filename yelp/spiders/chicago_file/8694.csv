Art Institute of Chicago////I was sold a combo ticket to the sky deck despite that I'm a student, the next few days are windy and therefore the sky deck will probably be closed and the purchase of two individual tickets to these places would probably be cheaper. Soon after, the guy who sold me my ticket left and they couldn't refund my ticket until the manager and the same cashier came back from their breaks. Needless to say, this is so annoying and I wish the cashier had been more knowledgable about the cost of tickets for students.
