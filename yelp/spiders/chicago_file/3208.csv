The Purple Pig////This is a super, super popular restaurant. We were lucky to get seats without reservations. The space is extremely tight, so be prepared if you're claustrophobic. I was shoulder to shoulder with my BF and a nice stranger. Still, well worth a visit if you're in Chitown and like the shareable tapas concept among close friends.
