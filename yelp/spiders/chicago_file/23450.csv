Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We designed our own food tour of chicago and this was our first stop. We ordered a small deep dish to share between two of us and it was GOOD. More than the food, i'd like to compliment the service. Our server was excellent and I wish I could remember his name. He had a great energy about him and gave us some more recommendations of food to try in Chicago. He also brought us some Fannie Mae chocolates to sample. Thanks again!
