Smoque BBQ////The quality of the meat is very good.  The sauce they give you is sub par if you prefer sweeter sauces.  After my visit, a friend alerted me that they have other sauces available.  I wish someone on their staff would have let me know that they had different sauces available.  If the other sauces are good, then I will upgrade my review to a 4 star.  If you are on the south side, check our Hogwild on 148th and Pulaski.  They are cheaper and have very good food as well, but I think the quality of the beef brisket at Smoque is slightly better.
