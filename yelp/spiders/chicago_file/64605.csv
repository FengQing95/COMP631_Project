Smoque BBQ////Next, the ribs! Man oh man, it's been so long since I've had ribs and they were phenomenal. I cleaned each rib to the bone. Each rib was so meaty and flavorful and the 1/4 rack was perfect! My friends 1/2 baby rack ribs were much smaller (not sure the appeal of baby back over St. Louis?). The ribs came with a small cup of the St. Louis sauce and I wasn't a fan of this sauce actually. It was more tangy than I would prefer. If I were to compare Q BBQ with Smoque, Q would definitely win the sauce category with their variety and unlimited quantities. Since I had brisket at Q, I can't compare the meats, but both had me blown away!
