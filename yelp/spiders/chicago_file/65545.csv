Smoque BBQ////Smoque definitely has the charm of what BBQ should be and is definitely the best in the city, while I'm sure TX and other popular places have it beat. I'm dying to come back and try their peach cobbler and consume more delicious BBQ. Prices were also much cheaper than other BBQ places I've been to while the portions were appropriate. For all that we got for under $50 after tax and their amazing service, Smoque deserves all the hype. *Definitely choose wisely on when to come though.
