Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I had ordered the sausage deep dish.  The crust was perfect.  It was right up the side of the pan like a wall to hold in the goodness.  Lou's sauce is my favorite as well.  They put the right amount on top and the consistency is just right.  That is important to me especially because my wife doesn't like sauce that is too acidic.
