Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////#41 Catalan tomato bread with white anchovies $7.50 never had this at other tapas so I have nothing to compare it to, but it reminded me of bruschetta that I'd have it at other LEYE restaurants and made me wonder if they use the same tomato mix on the bread from Italian to this Spanish restaurant.
