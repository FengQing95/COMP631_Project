Smoque BBQ////The beans took the gold. They had an addicting smoke flavor and just enough sweetness to make you want to ditch the spoon and drink it out of the container. (Okay, maybe that's just me). But seriously, Smoque BBQ should can the sauce from the bbq beans. I found it even better than the Memphis style and Carolina style sauces.
