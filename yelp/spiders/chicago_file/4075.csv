The Purple Pig////Pork Belly - This is the second dish we received and was tied for the most impressive flavor wise.  The complaint I have here is the portion size.  While I know this is a tapas restaurant, it still seemed tiny in comparison to everything else we received.  I feel doubling the size of this dish would give it more value.  I still highly recommend ordering this however because the flavor was spectacular.
