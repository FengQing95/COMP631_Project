The Purple Pig////I enjoy family style restaurants because you get to try a bit of each dish without having to commit fully to one. We ordered the bone marrow, broccoli, octopus, chicken kebab and pork shoulder dish. All were wonderful. The pork shoulder was to die for and was my most favorite. The meat was tender and the mashed potato, silky smooth. I don't know how the prepared the pork but it was so tender. The chicken kebab sounds boring, but the taste was far from that. They cook (I think oven grill?) the chicken so that it has a slight char to it, without making the meat lose its tenderness.The grill taste was apparent even with the chicken making it my second favorite. The bone marrow went well with the crispy toast, and the cilantro and salt really accentuated the creamy, fatty taste of the marrow. The broccoli and octopus were good too, but the ones described are definitely must trys and favorites of mine.
