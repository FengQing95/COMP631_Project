Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute is a definite must-visit museum in Chicago. I consider it easily top three among all the ones I've been to in New York, London, SF, and DC.  Three floors with multiple buildings (which connect ONLY on the first floor) full of art from all over the world.  I especially like the brightly-lit interior, high ceilings, and very-comfortable air conditioning.  They also offer free WIFI, plenty of seats, and some decent grub too.  You can easily spend a day here and still not see everything.
