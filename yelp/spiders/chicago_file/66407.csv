Little Goat Diner////Very interesting, well-prepared menu. Friendly, helpful staff. Sloppy Goat and Goat Chili didn't arrive as hot as I would have liked, but staff quickly and satisfactorily replaced my chili when I brought the issue to their attention (my dining partner was too intent on demolishing his Sloppy Goat sandwich to worry much about the temperature of it). Dining room is extremely loud: we were at a table for 2 and still had trouble hearing each other talk.
