The Purple Pig////Fantastic restaurant! Excellent food, great ambience, marvelous location, and superb choices. The one downside I will mention is the server. Â In my party everybody was done eating by the time my food came out. I mentioned this much to our server (Mauro) and all he had to say was "here food only comes out when it's ready" no helpfulness or customer orientation. Service is the one thing I would selectively improve upon. That said, do not miss the chance to come here! Food is too good to miss- just the sync failed big time.
