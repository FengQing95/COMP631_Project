Smoque BBQ////Went at 6PM on a Wednesday and faced no line. By the time we were leaving though a line was beginning to form. The owner of the establishment was warm and friendly when my friend inquired as to what style of BBQ they specialized in and gave us a bunch of different sauces to sample. Will definitely try to make it back on another weekday sometime.
