Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Dessert was the Chocolate Cream Pie, best dessert I have ever had, the Lemon Merengue Pie, and Vanilla Bourbon Chai Tea. The chocolate pie was absolutely the most decadent and delicious dessert I have ever experienced, with a level of flavors and textures unexplicable. A must try for any visit. The merengue did not quite compare, and the tea was pretty good.
