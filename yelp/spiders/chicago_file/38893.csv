Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I was not impressed to be honest. I think my steak may have sat under a lamp for a bit, the outside was over cooked, the inside was perfectly mid rare (the sauce on the side had a thick layer on top and had been overheated before it got to my table). It was tender but not something I'd write home about.
