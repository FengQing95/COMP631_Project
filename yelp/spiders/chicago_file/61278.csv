Smoque BBQ////The place is chill for the time I was there. The food menu is everything you would expect from a bbq joint so if your not about it then don't act surprised when your ordering a vegetarian wrap. I had one of there burgers with fries and I enjoyed it. they have some decent specials here there. Â check it out if your in the area. other than that it's not a totally amazing spot that I would come back to again.
