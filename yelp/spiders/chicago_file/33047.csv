Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////2. The stroganoff and side of bacon came out first but the rest of our meal didn't arrive right away. Â No more than 2 minutes after the stroganoff was served, the manager came to our table and apologized for the wait and comped our sides. We were so impressed that she took the initiative to approach us to explain that the kitchen was a little behind and that we would have to wait just a few more minutes. This alone was worth the 5 stars in my opinion.
