Little Goat Diner////We ordered several dishes, all of which were amazing.  The goat cheese chili fries were a unique blend on this common bar staple.  My girlfriend ordered a burger and it was delicious.  Plenty of flavor and the perfect size for lunch.  My dish of choice was the Sloppy Goat, their modern version of the sloppy joe made with goat on a squash roll.  To describe this dish in one word, wow.  It was huge and just as messy as the school cafeteria version of times past, only twice as good and not served by someone wearing a hair net!
