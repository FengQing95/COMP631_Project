Little Goat Diner////Little Goat has exactly the kind of comfort diner food I was looking for one day, only kicked up a notch with creativity as you'd expect from Stephanie Izard. The place itself is also casual, kinda kitschy and nice - especially for a dinner. We came here at 5:30 one day and the place was practically empty which was surprising, but it was almost full by the time we left.
