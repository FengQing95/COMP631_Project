Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I arrived on a Saturday night with a couple friends, the staff were very friendly when they informed us it would be around a 2.5hr wait for the 4 of us, or we could keep a close eye on the bar seating and snatch up a table when one became available. We opted for the later and had found a table within 15 minutes!
