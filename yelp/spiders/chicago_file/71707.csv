Little Goat Diner////Their service is on point as well.  From the hosts, to the wait staff, to the bus boys, to the chefs.  One time sat at the bar in front of the kitchen (damn hot by the way), and the chef was laughing at my friend's and I jokes.  Very personable people that make your dining experience better.
