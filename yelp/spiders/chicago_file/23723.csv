Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I sat at the bar, ya know, the whole driving cross country alone thing. And I'd had a really fun day being a tourist and wanted to chit chat with the bartender. Again, I ran into the problem I've been having which is Being a female while waited on by a female. She was completely disinterested in me. I tried to engage her in conversation and she was just not havin it. Gave me the bare minimum while socializing with her coworker friends at the service bar.
