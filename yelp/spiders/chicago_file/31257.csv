Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The deep dish here isn't as deep as we thought it would be. However, it was filling and the ingredients were fresh. Absolutely loved the crunchy crust. The pizza was good but not very mind blowing. Maybe I just love NY pizza and thin crust more. Lou Malnati's is definitely worth a try though.
