Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////To avoid the long wait times for dinner during the weekend, we decided to order to go. We order the Malnati Chicago Classic, The Lou and the Malnati Salad. I don't know if we just ordered on a "good day," but the Classic was cooked perfectly with the right amount of sauce. It wasn't dry at all. I actually prefer the Lou over the Classic because it's not has heavy and hardy as the Classic. I would also recommend getting the Malnati Salad. Their home made sweet vinaigrette is extremely addicting and makes you crave more salad.
