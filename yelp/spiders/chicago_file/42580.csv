Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is open nightly for dinner and also has Friday lunch and weekend brunch. They post special events on their website such as a Flamenco Dinner Show with music and dancing and Paella Cooking Demos. The atmosphere is lively and casual and the decor is made to transport you to Spain without being tacky or overdone. Service is reasonably attentive and adequate. Â Ba-Ba-Reeba is a popular venue so it can be a bit noisy and reservations are recommended (they are on Open Table). There is a large bar where you can enjoy a glass of Sangria as you wait for your party to arrive, but I did appreciate that they sat us before our entire party arrived. The menu has a nice variety of food to choose from (even the vegetarians in our group found plenty to keep them happy) and while the food is certainly not outstanding, for the money it is a good choice if you are in the mood for Spanish tapas.
