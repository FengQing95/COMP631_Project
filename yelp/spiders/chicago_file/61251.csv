Smoque BBQ////I finally made the trip to Smoque. Very good BBQ, but I hesitate to call it the best BBQ I've ever had. We went on a rainy Friday night and there was no line at all. I got the pulled pork platter and paid an extra 60 cents for a bun (weird), but it was good and the portion size was more than enough. I'm satisfied with my experience. I dunno if I would drive the distance again purely for Smoque, but I'd def go if I found myself in the area.
