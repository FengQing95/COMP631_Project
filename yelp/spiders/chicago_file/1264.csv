Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Yummy breakfast joint in a terrific downtown location.  Standard eggs & homemade hash browns with excellent caramel apple pecan pancakes.  My colleague enjoyed her omelette.  Prices are normal & atmosphere is a step up from an IHOP.  Great for a client breakfast with plenty of tables for larger groups.
