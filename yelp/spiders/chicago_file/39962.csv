Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I was on the hunt for the best steakhouse in Chicago for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. This place is definitely it!! Myself being a vegan, it is very difficult to find a steakhouse that has any options (I just ask for one salad!!). I was very happy to see they offer a vegetarian menu that includes items that can be veganized. Our waitress (I forgot her name) was AMAZING and so accommodating. On top of that, my boyfriend said it was the best steak he's ever had (he got the dry aged rib eye). Atmosphere and drinks were *chef's kiss*. I would definitely come back here again, it's worth the price.
