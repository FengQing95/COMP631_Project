Smoque BBQ////I had super high expectations coming in after seeing all the positive reviews. I shared a beef brisket with cole slaw and two other sides (chili and mac and cheese) and a pulled pork sandwich with the hubby. When the food came out, the portion sizes were much smaller than expected. Luckily, we weren't that hungry when we came for lunch. The pulled pork was just okay in my opinion...I preferred the beef brisket. The chili was unexciting--it was watery and had no meat in it. The mac and cheese was decent but I totally skipped out on the cole slaw (not a fan).
