Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Been a customer for 7 years. I have only ever delivered. Deep dish is incredible- the cheese is not too salty, and the tomatoes are not too sweet or acidic. The bruschetta is fantastic. I had one bad experience, but they made it up to me. I will continue to order from them.
