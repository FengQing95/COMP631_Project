Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We started with the Malnati salad, which was WTF the best salad I've ever had. The dressing was perfect--didn't coat the salad too much, but enough to give it a nice flavor. Easily our favorite part of the salad were the salami bits--crunchy, not chewy. I could eat that salad all day, every day. The calamari was also great; not too much breading but enough to coat the calamari to give it some crunch.
