Little Goat Diner////This place never disappoints. I had a friend visiting from out of town, and I brought him knowing it would be a hit. They have a huge selection on their menu for brunch and lunch, and the pricing is definitely fair for the amazing quality and quantity of food. I would definitely make a reservation, because there always is a wait. We had one and our table was even running a bit behind, but the staff was very friendly and apologetic. I'll definitely be back again.
