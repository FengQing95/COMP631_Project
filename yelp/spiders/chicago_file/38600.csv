Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Once we were done with the entree I asked about the desert menu and our waiter said they'd bring one. About 3-4 minutes after he came back with a Chocolate Cream Pie that had a sparkler in it since they knew it was my girlfriend's birthday. This was a really nice touch and we both really appreciated it. Needless to say, the chocolate cream pie was delicious like the rest of our food.
