Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza itself.  Individual size, which at first looked small, but then again it was deep dish where size is deceiving when compared to thin crust.  Sausage was delicious, a mild blend of Italian spices and very juicy.  The cheese, sauce, tomato... so much better than I remembered!  I was more full than I anticipated and took the last two slices to go, which did NOT make it back to the hotel since I finished them off before I got there!  VERY good.
