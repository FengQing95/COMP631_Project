Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We flew in late and grabbed a large and medium pie to go. Both pies ran about $50. Either everyone was super hungry or the pie was just that good. Â Yup it was so good that I ate every little bite. I've had Giordanos before and think LM's pie is just better. A must try when in the Windy City!
