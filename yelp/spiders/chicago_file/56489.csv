Smoque BBQ////I am from Texas and I have to say, this is GREAT BBQ. I cannot believe there is this hidden gem in Chicago, amazing. I ordered the baby back ribs and the briskets, which was recommended by AL, one of the employees. I also had the mac and cheese, and the cole slaw, both excellent. The cole slaw has a really lite vinaigrette dressing and it goes so well with everything since some things are quite heavy. The meats were absolutely moist and smokey and it's out of this world. I have no idea why anyone would complain about this restaurant. Also, they may not tell you but you should ask for the pickled jalapenos, those are so yummy, especially if you put it with your mac and cheese, weird combo but DELICIOUS. I have to say this will be a place to visit next time i'm in Chicago.
