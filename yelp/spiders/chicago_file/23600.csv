Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visiting from out of town and I got what I was I looking for! Ordered the Small Malnati Chicago Classic with spinach mix. The wait time was about 35 minutes for 2. It was great that you had the option to preorder since this place was so busy, but by the time we sat down and and waited for awhile until actually got our food, it would have taken about the same time to order once seated and receive our food at a different place. Our waitress was friendly and the meal met my expectations for a classic deep dish! Overly buttered on some parts of the crust to where I felt like I was eating straight butter, but that's a minor detail. I wasn't sure that a small would fill hungry ol' me and my large 6'2 friend, but our eyes were a lot hungrier than our stomachs- we struggled to finish it all. Great overall experience and I would recommend this to anyone visiting!
