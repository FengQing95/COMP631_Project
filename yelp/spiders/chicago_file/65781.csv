Smoque BBQ////Prior to the Governor's shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I'd have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don't carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it's a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot.
