Little Goat Diner////Came to the restaurant last night with some co-workers from Miami to enjoy some of the best food that Chicago (and Stephanie Izard) have to offer. Everything that we ordered was nothing but amazing and everyone enjoyed the cool vibe! We were very lucky to be served by Dylan who was very attentive, provided wonderful recommendations and made our experience at the Little Goat memorable. Lastly, a special shout-out to our FAVORITE manager Ben-- You made our night. Let's just say that we will never look at blueberry pie the same!! Thank you again for such delicious food and exceptional service!
