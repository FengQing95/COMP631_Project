Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////There were definitely service issues in this location as one waiter tried to drop off food that wasn't ours, and then our bill at the end reflected chicken wings (an order for only $9.99) instead of our pizza and drinks.  We were tempted to just pay the bill we received after the cold food and bad service, but moral values won out and we called the waitress's attention to it.
