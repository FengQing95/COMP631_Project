Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Festive and vibrant, Ba-Ba-Reeba serves some tasty tapas and sangria. I ordered the Rioja short rib, Maine scallops with couscous and pine nuts, and Roasted spinach and mushrooms. The short rib was extremely tender and had a delicious au jus with a splash of rioja flavor. Three scallops was a generous portion size but the quality and flavor were a little lacking. Finally, and unfortunately at the bottom, the spinach had a nice texture but was way over salted which left it almost inedible.
