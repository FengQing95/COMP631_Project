Little Goat Diner////On a trip to Chicago I realized I couldn't make it to the Girl and the Goat because I didn't make a reservation 3 months in advance (though if you show up when it opens I've heard you can get bar seating easily) I was excited to find out that it has a sister restaurant across the street in the Little Goat. Also luckily, my girlfriend doesn't like seafood and loves breakfast food, so the Little Goat fit perfectly for our needs. We arrived early on a Saturday morning at a little after 8am and almost got a table immediately. Quickly after we were seated though a line started forming at the door.
