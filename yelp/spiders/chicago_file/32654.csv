Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Excellent cocktails, great service, amazing food, and wonderful ambience. We went to Bavetts last night with another couple. Our server was very knowledgable and helpful when it came to selecting menu options. I had the meatloaf, which was perfect. We did order the wedge salad earlier in the meal with the bacon on the side. I ended up eating some of the bacon with my meatloaf-highly recommend that little trick. Really, everything from the bread to start the meal to the chocolate pie and whiskey ice cream for dessert was outstanding!
