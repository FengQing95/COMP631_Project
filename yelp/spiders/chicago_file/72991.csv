Little Goat Diner////i love the atmosphere of Little Goat. It's got like a retro/mod diner appeal to it and you can definitely see rustic elements that you would also find while dining at Girl & the Goat. There's something on the menu that can please anyone's palette I believe. Little Goat is kind of like a bourgeosie Denny's haha (& i don't mean that in a bad way, because I love me some "moons over my hammy").
