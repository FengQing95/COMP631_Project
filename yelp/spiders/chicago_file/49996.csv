Smoque BBQ////The ribs were extremely tender (came right off the bone) and had just the "right amount of smoke". The rub was so excellent, you didn't need the sauce. Though we did try it. It's not your usually thick tomato type sauce, but very vinegary (very South Carolina). An awesome dipping sauce for your French fries. I would say the same about the pulled pork.
