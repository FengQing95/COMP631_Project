Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ended up ordering the spinach bread and the Malnati Chicago Classic and both were amazing! The spinach bread is a smaller sized loaf of bread filled with cheesy goodness and a little bit of spinach as well. The pizza with the butter crust is amazing as well! Took about 30 min for them to make the pizza but it was definitely worth the wait. The crust has a really nice crunch to it all around and every bite was filled with ooey gooey mozzarella goodness and Oh my, they definitely do not skimp on the sausage! Instead of bits of sausage, it seemed like they had sausage on every inch of the pie! A small pizza and the spinach bread were more than enough for our party and I would highly recommend the deep dish pizza here to anyone!
