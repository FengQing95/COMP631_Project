Smoque BBQ////The food is perfectly prepared tender and the smoke taste does not overwhelm the meat.  Fries are fresh cut, not over salted and very delicious. The coleslaw is vinegar based and very fresh.   The brisket chili  side will make cap off your main dish.  For dessert, the pecan bread pudding will have you kicking yourself for not ordering two.  Don't plan on splitting this delight, its portion is perfect for one and it is so good that you will not utter "only a bite for me".
