Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////3) Octopus: Check out my picture, does that look appetizing? It was overly oily and rubbery. My cousin had never tried octopus and I convinced him (Since I savor the octopus at Taverna Kyclades in Astoria, Queens and even Boqueria). Our server said "it's everyone's favorite..." (This dish reaffirmed why I left Chicago after living there for 3 years).
