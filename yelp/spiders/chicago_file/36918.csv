Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Now, in the event you care about the steak at a steak place and not just the drinks and comfort like I do.....the food was almost all very good.  I tried some of the smoked trout caesar salad and it was very good.  I love caesar salads and this one might be at the top of my list now.  The salmon was also very good, cooked perfectly and seasoned just right.  We had some oysters that were also yummy.  The steak however was not cooked as ordered, which is a problem if you wanna call yourself a steak place.  This should be the thing you definitely get right.  I had some of the elotes too and while they were good, they didn't remind me of elotes much.
