Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came here for lunch by myself as my husband was attending a conference. Sat solo at the bar with my purse on the hook in front of me never it out of my sight. By the end of my quick personal pizza and peroni lunch someone had swiped my wallet from inside my purse. I realize this can happen anywhere I just hope others read my story. I was visiting from out of town and in less then 20 min the thief racked up 3.5K in debit/credit card debt and not to mention the time its taking me to put my life back together, fly home without ID etc etc. Staff were apologetic and kind but just totally sucked....fyi the man was dressed like a driver, said he was "waiting for a table" but then never sat for one, paid his drink with cash and dashed when another couple came by for a drink.
