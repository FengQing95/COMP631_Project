Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I really enjoyed my evening here. The restaurant has a chill, yet classy, speakeasy type vibe. Everyone we encountered from the hostesses to the servers were super friendly and welcoming. The drinks were really good. I ordered the short rib stroganoff and my friend for the spaghetti with the giant meatball. The portions were more than enough as neither of us made a dent in our meals. I also had a wedge salad and my friend had the trout Caesar. I got a green tea and my friend got coffee after dinner. The coffee is french press and our server noticed that there were some grounds.. Without a seconds hesitation she apologized, offered a replacement and took both beverages off of the bill.
