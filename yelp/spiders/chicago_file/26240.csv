Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is my favorite place to get pizza! The staff has always been nice and the food is delicious! My friends and I were cravings for a lot of cheese and we were not disappointed. For an appetizer, we got Mozzarella sticks and it was so good. The cheese was stringy and the crust was crispy. For pizza, we got a deep dish called The "Lou." This is the pizza that keeps making me come back there. The crust is amazing and it is really hard to describe in words how good they are. If you ever have the chance to visit this place, I highly recommend. If you do plan to go, make sure you have plenty of time since there is usually a line there (while your waiting, preorder your deep-dish pizza).
