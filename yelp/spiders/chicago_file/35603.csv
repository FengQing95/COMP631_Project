Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The thing that really makes this experience stand out to me is the fact that I had a pretty serious cold at the time. I expected to taste nothing. The fact that I still perceived the steak as so delightfully flavorful affirms that it really must have been excellent: if I had been there without a cold, chances are it would've been even better. I certainly intend to go again.
