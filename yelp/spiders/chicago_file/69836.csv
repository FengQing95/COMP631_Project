Little Goat Diner////My friend took me here for my birthday and it was delicious! The shrimp app was a little odd for my taste, but it wasn't bad. The curry mayo was my favorite, oddly enough. What really made the experience was the server, Julie (or Julia, sorry). She was attentive and genuine. I didn't feel like she was fishing for tips, but she was definitely going above and beyond to make sure we left happy. And, that we did. So, thanks for the experience and the awesome service!
