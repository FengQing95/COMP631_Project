Little Goat Diner////Delicious! The mac and cheese here is to die for. Â The chicken fingers were also fresh yet crisp. Highly recommend if you look are looking for a diner that is high quality. The broccoli was also surprisingly amazing - ordered as an afterthought for some vegetables - but was the first portion our group scarfed down.
