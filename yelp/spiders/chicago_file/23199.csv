Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Super good pizza! We were excited to try true deep dish pizza that our friends had reccomend. It didn't disappoint on the taste side of things. I was a little dissatisfied with how long we waited for the pizza after we were told the time line it would be ready. We called it in around 3pm and we were told it would be ready in 45min. After waiting 45 min we had to wait another 20... this was a bummer because I had to pay for parking when the plan was to just drop off the hubbs and take the block to pick him back up. (The pie its selfwas about $30) ... the napkin they put on top of the pizza stuck to the pizza and kinda killed the point of making Snap chat friends jealous. The pizza was good though so... 4 stars.
