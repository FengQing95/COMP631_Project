Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food is absolutely great let me first just say. The ambiance is cozy but Disappointing. After waiting well over an hour the put a this crappy little table right when you walk in. Our server was pretty rude and seemed bothered to be there or help. I give 3 stars only because of food. I heard how fabulous this was supposed to be and was let down.
