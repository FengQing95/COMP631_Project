Little Goat Diner////ohmuhgoooodddddddd. I went with a friend and we just ordered several plates. My favorites were the pulled pork nachos and the pineapple gazpacho. I honestly couldn't tell you what else we had because I just focused on those two delicious, beautiful, perfect plates deserved all my attention. We sat there for a while just chatting and munching and honestly, it was the best way to enjoy Little Goat Diner. If you walk next door to the bar area, and you are a smoker like me, you can marvel at all the rubs and sauces while grabbing a drink. This place is just my everything.
