Smoque BBQ////Yelp wants me to write more, so I will. This gem in Old Irving Park is amazing. The meat is fantastic, worth the wait. They have delicious sauce but give it to you on the side so you can appreciate the meat. Do not bring vegetarians here, you need to go with someone who loves meat and can appreciate the amazingness. Six stars.
