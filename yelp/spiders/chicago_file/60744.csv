Smoque BBQ////Out of all their meat options, the ribs are the most notable. Both the St. Louis, which are larger and meatier, or the baby back, which are leaner and smaller, are fantastic, and hold up well with the best from Texas or Alabama. The rub is great, the smoke flavor is excellent, and the meat is obviously of very high quality.
