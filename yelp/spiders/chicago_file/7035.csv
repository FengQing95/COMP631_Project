Art Institute of Chicago////The staff for the most part is invisible.  We were looking for American art and according to the map we were on the right track.  We walked past two museum staff as we made a turn into a closed exhibit.  There weren't any signs stating that the area was closed.  They saw us and other people walk into the same dead end and not a peep was said to any of us.  I saw a staff member arguing with a patron about going back in to use the bathroom.  No reentry according the staff member.
