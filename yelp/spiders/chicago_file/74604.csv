Little Goat Diner////Awful experience.  Starting with the smug and indifferent host then a server who took our order and never returned.  Two out of three meals inedible and left on the table.  Server didn't notice though cause she never came back.  Chased some guy down for a check who wordlessly dropped it in front of me.  Smoked fries were cold and underdone.  Tuna melt was swimming in some sauce that reminded me of movie theater fake nacho cheese sauce.  Spanish  omelet overdone and cold.  Overall the menu items simply "have too many notes".
