Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was actually very fortunate because a co worker was very familiar with the pizza in the city as he had been here a few times and after he had heard my experience with Giordano's he told me that I had to try Lou Malnati's or I would not be getting the right deep dish pizza experience. So that night I order a pepperoni, sausage, and cheese deep dish pizza.
