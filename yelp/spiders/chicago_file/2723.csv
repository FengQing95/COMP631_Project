The Purple Pig////The restaurant is really close to Millennium Park where all of the tourists go. It's also right across the street from Michael Jorden's Steak House. The entrance is a little hard to notice if you're not looking for it (you enter through the outdoor patio area), but the sign outside on Michigan Ave is pretty hard to miss.
