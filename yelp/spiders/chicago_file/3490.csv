The Purple Pig////The Purple Pig is probably one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. They do not take reservations as they do it first-come-first serve style. As a result, I recommend trying to arrive early to put your name down, but expect a 1.5-2 hr wait to be safe. Fortunately, you're in Chicago and near Mag Mile, so boredom won't be an issue. Seating is a bit tight as quarters are quite close, but it allows for an intimate setting with your party and even possible light conversation with complete strangers, especially if you are all seated at the same table.
