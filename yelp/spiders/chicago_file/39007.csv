Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////To start, my date and I had a dozen oysters. They are presented with spectacular decoration on your normal bed of ice. We followed this with bone marrow that quite literally melts in the mouth! WOW! It is so hard to find bone marrow this good. For dinner, two petite filets one topped with - please follow in my foot steps - gorgonzola cheese, medium. These steaks were to perfection. Even without the cheese, the steak had amazing flavor. But the gorgonzola topped steak was that much more amazing. We had a baked potato and truffled mac & cheese for sides. The baked potato was a baked potato... looking back, we should've tried a veggie instead. But the mac & cheese was sooooooooooo good! I took it home. LOL
