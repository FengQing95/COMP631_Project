Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////i LOOOOVVVVEEEEEEE pizza!  But hmm... Something must have gone wrong or something here!   We arrived 10 minutes before they opened.  By the time the doors opened there was a line waiting for the doors to open.  We ordered the chicago deep dish pizza and it had sausage, lots of sausage.  Let me clarify what I mean by a lot of sausage.  There was not a single area on the pie that did not have sausage.  The WHOLE ENTIRE top had a thick layer of sausage!!!!!  Next thing to know about the pizza is that its THICK, hence chicago deep dish.  But lemme tell you the cheese is about an inch thick!!!!  Maybe more!
