Smoque BBQ////I'm not even sure why I'm going to make a yelp review for Smoque,  It has over 2500 reviews at this point, its been on tv, its been in the papers.  You either love the food, or you really like the food... OR you're a competitor giving a false review.  If you're on yelp and have been eating in Chicago for more than a few years and you have to look this place up because you don't know what it is, maybe its time for you to stop being on yelp.
