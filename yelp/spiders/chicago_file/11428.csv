Art Institute of Chicago////Just an amazing museum full of wonderful pieces. It's a huge museum and you will walk a lot so please dress comfortable and wear a decent pair of shoes! This isn't a place to put on a fashion show no one cares what you look like or what you're wearing! Enjoy yourself and have fun!
