Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The deep dish pizza IS HUGE and tastes great. We got the Lou Malnati's special and that thing was bigger than my face. The taste was great and I definitely recommend getting the garlic butter crust on any of their pies. The only complaint I had about the pizza is that it was way too wet and kind of soggy. Other than that it was really good!
