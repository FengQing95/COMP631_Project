Little Goat Diner////We went here when we couldn't get into girl and the goat, but we weren't disappointed. It has an almost upscale diner vibe with nice lighting. I had the fat Elvis waffles and my boyfriend had some tasty sandwich au jus. My waffles were light and crispy with bacon bits, banana and a peanutbutter butter. Salty and sweet.
