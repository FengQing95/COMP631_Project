Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Meh: pork paella. Idk what it was because I love pork, and this thing has 3 kinds (pork belly, roast pork, and some sausage), but it just didn't do it for me. I didn't love the flavor of the paella. They do give you a big heaping plate though for one serving (min order 2) at $14.
