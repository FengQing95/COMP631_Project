The Purple Pig////We got to the restaurant around 11:30ish on a Saturday so it was relatively busy. It was only the two of us so we were able to squeeze in at the end of the bar. Best. Seats. Ever. We were RIGHT next to the action. All of the grilling, braising, pickling, plating was right in front of us! We got to see every plate go out while we were there and man that kitchen was ROLLING out food. I definitely recommend trying to get the end of the bar seats (there are 4) if you're not looking for any super intimate 1 on 1 time with your food partner.
