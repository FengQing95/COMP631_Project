Little Goat Diner////The menu has a wide range of choices.  I have tried several dishes and they've all exceeded expectations.  It's cheerful, lively and fun.  The service is really great - helpful with the menu, quick and all nice. The service makes the food better! The food is flavorful and there are a lot of choices. It's a fun place to go with friends, friends from out of town or coworkers.
