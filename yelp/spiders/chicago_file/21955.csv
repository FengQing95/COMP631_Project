Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Finally! I have finally had authentic deep dish Chicago pizza. I have to say, I do miss the tons of toppings that we usually pile our pies with in California. The salad my friend ordered was pretty good too and glad we didn't order much more because the pie was good, but really filling.
