The Purple Pig////Our waiter was awesome....very friendly and happy to make recommendations. We ordered a wine for the table. Started with a few appetizers- I got the huevos rotos and nearly died of ecstasy they were so good and my friend ordered the grilled broccoli which was top notch. I also ordered the recommended smoked pork tongue which was like a savory chewy bacon (great choice) and the pork belly which was so tender and well prepared with the mix of flavors from the carrots and ginger glaze. I also appreciated that at a place that advertises pig, they had a lot of actually tasty vegetarian options.
