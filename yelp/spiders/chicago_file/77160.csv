Little Goat Diner////Thankful for the gluten-free menu and knowledgable server, Meghan, who clarified why the omelette had gluten in it (it's in their tomato sauce?!). I took a risk and tried their GF Bi Bum Bop Breakfast bowl with cauliflower rice, without kimchi (which has gluten) and enjoyed the tangy kick as a wake-me-up breakfast.
