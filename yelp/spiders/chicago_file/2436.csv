The Purple Pig////Unbelievable service with a fun atmosphere- we made friends with the people we were sitting with at the long table- and incredible food. Be ready to put your name in and wait. Get there early for les of a wait time, since you have to be back 10 minutes from when they text you. This is a must stop in Chicago.
