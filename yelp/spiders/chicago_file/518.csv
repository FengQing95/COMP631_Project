Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////To begin with, there's no such thing as a reservation at Wildberry Cafe. Being a city that's addicted to brunch, this is a problem, a big one. Noting the giant line outside, I braved the throngs of people to ask for a table. "20 to 25 minutes." Ugh. Fine. 40 minutes later, my group was being led to our table. And, despite walking to the table as a group, the gentleman who led us to our table expressed surprise that I was sitting down. "I didn't know you were with them." Um, did you not see me standing with the group, asking for a table and walking with the group? Was I just some stalker, following random groups of women like a creeper? Thanks. To add insult to injury, our table of three received two menus. Seriously, am I invisible?
