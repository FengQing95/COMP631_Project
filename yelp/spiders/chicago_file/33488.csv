Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I'm stunned by the continued high ratings for this restaurant.  We had a four star experience two years ago, but our recent experiences were poor.  We attempted to make a reservation there to no avail.  We left several messages and never received a call back.  My husband eventually got a live person on the phone who offered a 5:00 p.m. or an 8:00 p.m. seating on a weeknight.  He made the reservation, but we decide not to use it.  The day before he received a call offering a 7:45 reservation.  Whoopie!  NO THANKS.  We went elsewhere.
