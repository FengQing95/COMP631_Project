Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The food was really good. I was here for a breakfast on labor day. Tried to go the day before but they had an hour wait, so get here early. I had the eggs benedict with chorizo. It was perfectly done and really tasty. My wife had the signature triple berry pancakes which were good as well, but a little to sweet for my tastes. I recommend this as a good breakfast spot.
