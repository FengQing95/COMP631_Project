Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Another 5 star steakhouse experience here. All the food was delicious. I tried a bunch of different things and everything was good so I won't list everything I ate. While everything was amazing, my favorite part of the dinner was the bacon roasted tomato salad, Brussels sprouts, and the baked crab cake. Â To be honest, I'm not a salad, vegetable, or even crab cake kinda guy yet all these were arguably my favorite part of the meal. The bacon was unbelievable and I never eat tomatoes, but I enjoyed them at Bavette's in the salad. Crab cake was also very good and the brussels sprouts tasted strangely similar to popcorn(good thing for me). I had appetizers, salad, steak, and dessert and everything was great. Only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bearnaise sauce. The menu wasn't huge, but there were plenty of options and all were amazing. Portions were great, too. I left feeling very full and satisfied.
