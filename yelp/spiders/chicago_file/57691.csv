Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We weren't very hungry but needed to try some of these excellent dishes. We ordered the grilled octopus first- the best octopus I have had. The texture was so deliciously chewy, and the sauce flavorful and rich. Even the potatoes were excellent. We also ordered the cured salmon after seeing another party get it. It was like a Spanish version of lox, but tasty nonetheless.
