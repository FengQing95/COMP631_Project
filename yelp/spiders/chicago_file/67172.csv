Little Goat Diner////This place did not disappoint!  After dinner at Girl and the Goat, I decided to try Little Goat for breakfast.  This place has the creativity of Girl and the Goat, but I have to say Stephanie took it up a notch by adding a bit of twist to all the dishes and was not afraid to experiment.  "Little goat" was a goat milk latte that sounded delicious...I've never had anything like it.  It might be a bit "goaty" for people who don't like the gamey taste though.  The tempura mashed potatoes were heavenly and delicious.  The pork belly Benedict aka the brandade and belly was stuffed w pork belly and savory to the last bite.  I wasn't a fan of the bull's eye french toast though.  The toast was a bit thick and dry for me and the taste wasn't all there, although there was a surprise splash of sunny side up eggs inside the toast.  All in all, I was impressed by the amount of creativity put into all the dishes.  Service was prompt and friendly and the environment was very comfortable.  Our waitress Alexandra also did an excellent job recommending dishes!
