Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We got the signature Chicago classic. The deep dish pizza here isn't as thick as the other pizza places in town, in fact it's the thinnest deep dish I've seen.   While still tasty, I'm not a fan of how the pizza is layered with the dough first, followed by the sauce, then cheese and meat on top.
