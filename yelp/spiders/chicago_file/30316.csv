Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It takes 40 minutes for them to make the pizza. We ordered the Chicago classic which was delicious. It's not going to blow your mind, so don't have sky high expectations when you come here. The small was more than enough food for the 2 of us, so don't order more than that because the portions are large and you're going to end up with a lot of leftovers
