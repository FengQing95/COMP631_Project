Little Goat Diner////I'd come back to Little Goat as everything which I saw coming out of the kitchen made me second guess my order. Our meal was on the heavy side, which given the very warm day wasn't the best pairing. However, on a cold winter night, this would really hit the spot. Welcoming atmosphere, easy to grab a seat, friendly staff and a diverse crowd dining around us. Food was great, too. My Rueben had wonderfully crispy pastrami and the kimchee was a creative twist. The onion rings were made with pickled onions which really set them apart from any that I'd had before. Best of all was the price. Two drinks, two meals and an appetizer for less than $70.
