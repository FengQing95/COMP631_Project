Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This restaurant is EXTREMELY dark and dim. It was legitimately difficult to see people at some of the other tables and even the food at our own. I guess it was kind of cool. Sorry about the quality of my pictures at this place though! Aside from that, I thought the restaurant's layout and atmosphere were on point. This place is surprisingly big! We sat in their downstairs basement dining room, which I had no idea existed from the front door. I enjoyed the taxidermy decor on the walls, and the seating was comfortable.
