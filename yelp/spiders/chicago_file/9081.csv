Art Institute of Chicago////Aside from the Impressionist collection, also worth viewing are the Asian art (currently closed), the Modern Wing, and the smaller collection of Dutch and Flemish masters. The Art Institute has other collections that are interesting: paperweights, swords and armor, salt cellars, a little bit of furniture, some archaeological pieces. There is not much in the way of sculpture, or, at least, little sculpture is on display.
