Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////What an awesome place to dine! It is so cool and edgy while being relaxing. I came here for my wedding anniversary and we tried the martinis, wine, oysters, bone marrow and aged steak. Double YUM! The service was friendly and attentive from the moment we walked in through the door. LOVED it!
