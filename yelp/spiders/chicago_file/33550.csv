Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great atmosphere and delicious food! Our waiter was very nice and attentive. He recommended to get the chicken which I did and I loved it. Also get the corn!! You won't regret it! It's delicious you'll want more! Only downside is you need to book your reservation about a month or so ahead of time but other than that overall amazing place and can't wait to go back!
