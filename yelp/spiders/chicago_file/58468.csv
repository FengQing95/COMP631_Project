Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Value: Good value, tapas run between $6 - $15 each. Our three tapas, paella, and dessert was more than enough to satisfy our hunger. The paella is minimum two to order and takes about 30 minutes so place that first then order a few tapas to tide you over while you wait. Yelp Tip, Â check in to unlock a free dessert tapas!
