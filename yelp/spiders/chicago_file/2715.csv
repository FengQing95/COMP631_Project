The Purple Pig////All the food here is phenomenal. My girlfriend and I split the deviled egg, ham croquettes, broccoli, orrechiette, and blade steak. Each dish seemed to be more delicious than the last! This is a great spot to try a lot of different dishes in case you can't decide. The food comes out very quickly as it is prepared. Just be warned they don't take reservations so make sure to put your name in early and have a plan for shopping on Michigan Ave or another fun activity while you wait.
