Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We were first sat right in front of the kitchen which my guest wasn't enthused about so we were moved to a smaller table towards the back, sitting closely to a couple (I presume it was a new relationship budding).  While we didn't chat it up too much, they were friendly, and we shared in a laugh when a server dropped a lemon into my jacket and picked it up quickly with a low key "sorry."  It didn't bother me in the least bit, where as I can imagine how others might have reacted.
