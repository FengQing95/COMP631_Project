The Purple Pig////Worth every single minute of waiting. We came on a Thursday night and had to wait roughly 85 mins before we got a table (they text you when it's ready), which we thought was still a long time but well worth it. Luckily this place is near many stores so shopping was a delight and definitely killed time. I tried the Spanish octopus which was tender and flavorful with a great balance of salt, sweet, and acid. My husband had the milk braised pork shoulder and was amazed on how tender the meat was. For a place that has been praised and highly reviewed it did not disappoint and deserved every star it has received thus far. If only it was closer to where we live....either way definitely a must visit if you're in the cities.
