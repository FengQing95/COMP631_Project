Bavette's Bar & Boeuf//// I had the 6oz filet mignon middle well, the steak was not flavorful at all!! There's just something off about this steak that just didn't taste right!! I'm just so disappointed!! Like I felt when I took a bite, the middle section tasted kinda weird, like it was a tad still frozen when the meat wasn't thaw out completely!! IDK it's just hard to explain but I wouldn't recommend ordering the steak really dry not flavorful at all!!!
