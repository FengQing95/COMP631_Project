The Purple Pig////I like the flavoring of all three dishes I got. But I would personally skip the pig eat dish if you don't like bacon. I think it's too crispy and I cannot taste the pig ear. I love the octopus dish because the flavoring is delicious. (Highly recommend). Pork shoulder has very nice flavor that I like. Each dish is around 16-24 which is pricey.
