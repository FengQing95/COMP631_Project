Little Goat Diner////When the waitress returns to our table I tell her that I'm afraid the breast is not done. She proceeds to tell me that it's "just the way they cook it". I admit, at this point I give her a funny look because I have NEVER been told a restaurant intentionally undercooks their chicken. That's just asking for serious bacterial issues. I proceed to explain that, no, I cook. I fry chicken. This is not how it should be cooked. Again, she insists that this is the way it's done because of the type of bird they use and that it's very expensive. It's at this point that I take hold of the breast with one hand and use my fork to pry the meat apart. It takes enough effort that my hand shakes a little. "Cooked chicken doesn't do that," I say. She seems annoyed but says they can cook it longer, if I like.
