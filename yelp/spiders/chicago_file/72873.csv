Little Goat Diner////The conversation and chatter in the restaurant was palpable - great atmosphere.  The menu had some great stuff, including a Cuban sandwich blue-plate special that my daughter ordered, but I ordered the pork sandwich.  For some strange reason, I got the "blue plate" (it said so, right on the plate!), instead of her.  We exchanged samples of each other's sandwich fillings, all delicious.
