Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Gave it four stars the first time around but I came for restaurant week and it was SO GOOD. Our waiter was very kind and accommodated a vegan restaurant week menu. I got the white sangria (my fiends got red) and it was great. Then I got house bread and the spicy roasted potatoes without aioli. Then main was the moroccan chickpeas followed by pear sorbet for dessert. SUPER yummy and great experience.
