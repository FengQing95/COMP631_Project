Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The best tapas bar in all of Chicago! Has a lot of classic Spanish tapas as well as their own creative versions. When I have people in town visiting this is one of my favorite spots to take them. I have been for both dinner & brunch and really enjoyed everything we ordered both times. Always excited to try one of their many Sangria selections which are all tasty & refreshing. Usually there is a longer wait if you don't have a reservation ahead of time, but there are also plenty of bar spots if you are aggressive enough to hawk.
