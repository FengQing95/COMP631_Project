Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Not super important but I felt that the restaurant was kind of dirty. The tables were oily and sticky. The environment is very casual. Don't dress nice or you will feel out of place. We just came back from the Giants/Cubs game and were dressed in line with that environment. We did get there at 11pm and were rushed to leave at 12pm. Understandable but kind of sucks to have to rush through eating a medium size pizza in 15-20 in.
