The Purple Pig////Roasted bone marrow: 4/5 I remember really loving this dish when I had it 5 years ago, so I was eager to recommend it to my guest and try it. It was indeed quite delicious but the ratio of bread to bone marrow did not quite match, and it was lukewarm in temperature. it was definitely still good, but not worth the cost or hype. Maybe it's only good the first time you try it?
