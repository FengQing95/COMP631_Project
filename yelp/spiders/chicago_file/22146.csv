Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We also got a thin crust pizza and this was also....almost... as good as the deep dish. Its tomatoes and spinach were cooked to perfection and the perfect amount of cheese was on the pizza. I'd definitely recommend this if you don't want something too heavy in a deep dish.
