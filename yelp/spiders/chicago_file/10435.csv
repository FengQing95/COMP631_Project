Art Institute of Chicago////The real place the museum shines though is in its amazing permanent collections. While all of the collections are amazing, my personal favorite is the fantastic selection in the Modern Wing of the museum. Â  The architecture of the wing and the art in the exhibits just absolutely speak to me, and I could spend entire days in there.
