Little Goat Diner////They have a separate vegan menu and a variety of vegetarian options on the regular menu. I ordered the Vegan Bi Bim Bap, and it was amazing. The flavors all came together really well, and the dish was super healthy. I would highly recommend this dish for vegans, vegetarians, or anyone who wants to have a healthy yet delicious meal.
