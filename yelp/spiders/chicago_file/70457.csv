Little Goat Diner////My table got the Korean Burger, Sloppy Goat, the Reuben and the smoke fries. The fries are huge - definitely enough for 4 people. Everything was incredible. The "squish squash bread" that the burger & sloppy goat come on is so good too - crunchy on the outside and sweet/potatoey inside.
