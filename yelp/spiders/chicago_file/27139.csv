Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First, I couldn't get over how clean this place was. Second, the service was excellent and everyone was attentive and kind. Third, none of this would have mattered if the food sucked. The food didn't suck. We went with the classic and it was a revelation. The butter crust was the best crust I've ever eaten.
