Little Goat Diner////Obviously the food was outstanding and I definitely plan on returning (I NEED to try the chicken and waffles) but the only downside was our server. When we asked her if she recommended anything her answer was that everything on the menu was equally popular. When we told her a couple choices we were stuck between she said they were both popular. No recommendations or suggestions or anything. With such a large menu filled with a ton of appetizing options, we just would've appreciated a little more feedback other than "everything is equally popular". The whole time she just seemed like she was anxious to get us to leave so that is what really kept it from being a 5 star experience. Good thing the food is outstanding...that's all that really matters, right?!
