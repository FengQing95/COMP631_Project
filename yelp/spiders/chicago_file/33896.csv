Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is one of the places that screams for a 5 star! Absolutely gorgeous atmosphere with exceptional service to match the ambiance! Food was fresh and delicious. I'd give my steak and frites 4/5 just bc I've had better but it was still up there! I couldn't be happier with this place and cannot wait to go back there again. Definately a place that impresses!
