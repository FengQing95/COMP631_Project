Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Still the best thick crust pizza around. The fat free cheese doesn't disappoint. Make sure to order uncut so it stays crispy:) Delivery can be hit or miss. I try to order early (less stops) to prevent getting a soggy pizza. Pick up is a great option if the weather isn't bad.
