Smoque BBQ////Since, as I said, I didn't try pork until I became an adult, I get a very minor stomach discomfort when I eat it - which means I only eat it when it's REALLY fucking good.  Smoque doesn't quite warrant the discomfort, but I'm going to be honest - if  I had never tried Uncle John's or Lem's, I'd probably give Smoque five stars.
