Smoque BBQ////Even though this place is no longer new it is amazing to me that there is still a line out the door on a Saturday evening at 6:30. Don't get me wrong the ribs are great but there are lots of places to get ribs nowadays. I think people go for the peach cobbler because it is out of this world tasty. We were told that Tuesdays and Wednesdays are the days to go. Street parking isn't too difficult and even though it is first come first serve seating the 4 guys working the floor make sure that no one sits before their order is placed.
