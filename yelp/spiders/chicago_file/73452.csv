Little Goat Diner////Two of us arrived shortly after 12pm. They have a nice lobby with a traditional diner touch. A nice gentleman told us about 20 minutes wait time. Left my cell # then just walk out to see what are place around here. Found a butcher place nearby selling fresh goat meat. Need to stop by later to get something.
