Smoque BBQ////I went to Smoque BBQ a few weeks back and I have to say I am totally coming back here and literally have told all of my friends to go ASAP. Really friendly staff and the food was amazing! I had heard about this place a few times and finally got a chance to go and it was everything I expected. I got the pulled pork with sides of mac and cheese, beans and peach cobbler, all which were great. I came when it was not too busy but when I was leaving it started to get busy so try to come on an off peak time. I also loved the layout of the food on the tray, I know that is silly but it is totally true.
