Smoque BBQ////We went out for a late lunch last Saturday and decided upon Smoque after seeing review in the Tribune.  For a late lunch on Saturday the place was still doing a brisk business.  After a 15 minute wait in line to place our order there was another 10 minutes to seating.  Seating is communal.  Ambiance is good.
