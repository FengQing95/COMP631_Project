Little Goat Diner////Few hiccups to begin messed it all up.  I checked in and they said a 40 minute wait... then we were forgotten about.  This was ok, that happens.   Two things bugged me however.  Once they noticed the error, they chose to seat another group of 3 before ours.  In addition there was no compensation for waiting another 20 minutes, no drink, just a quick "oh sorry"
