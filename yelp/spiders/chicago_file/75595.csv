Little Goat Diner////The d√©cor was very cute. A retrofitted 60s diner feel, with a bit of an upscale twist. What really brought me to write this review was the meeting that I caught with the GM and some of the employees. He was telling them that it was Lollapalooza weekend, so they should prepare for some rushes. BUT to always remember to be courteous and provide excellent service. He pointed out things such as "Always say excuse me. If a customer is coming, they have the right of way." "Always say thank you. This is extremely important.". Working in a restaurant myself, I tend to notice more than the typical customer and even prior to working in a restaurant, customer service is always an important factor in my experience. I have to applaud this manager for these callouts because it isn't something that other restaurants make a point to remember to do.
