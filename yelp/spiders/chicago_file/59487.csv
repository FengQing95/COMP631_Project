Smoque BBQ////I could have sworn I reviewed this place, I give it a three for several reasons. If you want to enjoy this place you better get there before the dinner time rush. This place can get really packed. So packed the line seems never ending. Second, I was not a fan of the there BBQ Sauce. To me and most texans/southerners know that the sauce should be a little more smoky and definitely a lot thicker then what they serve here. I just think the sauce is to thin for it's own good. Finally if this place were to expand it would be better right now it's a little crammed. Almost forgot one thing... You don't get bread with the brisket order.... what the heck are you suppose to eat the meat with?
