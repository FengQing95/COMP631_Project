Little Goat Diner////Overall the food was bland, my goat sloppy joe seemed like a manwich but with goat that had been rendered of so much flavor that it could've passed as bison or beef for the flavor. The house-made bun of the sloppy joe was pretty much perfect though. The high point of the food was the fries and quesadilla. The kalbi ribs had no flavor, and were beyond chewy.
