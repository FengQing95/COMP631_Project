Art Institute of Chicago////This place is MASSIVE!! From the outside, I had no idea how big it was!! You could probably spend a week on here and still miss some of the art. Note: they loan art out to other museums, and they change the art up. We had a couple pieces we wanted to see but one was in NYC and the other is temporarily off exhibit so other pieces can be displayed. Whatever your art pleasure is... sculpture, paintings, fine china.. it's all there!
