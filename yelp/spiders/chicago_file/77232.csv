Little Goat Diner////Came here on Saturday, we had made reservations months ago to have my family come in and celebrate my birthday here for brunch. We arrived exactly at 12:15pm for our reservation, and were told they were waiting for our table to finish eating, and that it would be 10-15 minute wait. 20 minutes go by, we check on the status of our reservation, and the girl working the host stand didn't have anything more to tell me. 45 minutes go by and at this point we are starving, and aggravated. Finally we get seating almost an hour later. At that point- I don't care how great your food is, if your customers have to wait an hour for their reservation, that is a huge problem. Either: A) don't accept reservations or B) make sure you have a maximum amount of time set for table reservations. There's no reason why we had to wait over an hour when we had taken the time to be prepared and made these reservations months ago.
