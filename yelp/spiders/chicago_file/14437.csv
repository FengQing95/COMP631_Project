Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Deep dish pizzas can be a hefty meal.  Not Lou Malnati's pizza.  I can say, without a doubt, that this is the best deep dish pizza.  It's not too doughy, and it is just the right amount of saucy!  The crust was incredible!  When it comes to pizza, I"m all about the crust.  To me, all crusts taste good, but Lou Malnati's crust is PHENOMENAL!
