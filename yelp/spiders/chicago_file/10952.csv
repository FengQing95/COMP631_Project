Art Institute of Chicago////But man -- this museum deserves the accolades.  It seems like every picture one studies in Art Appreciation 101 is here!  Wood's 'American Gothic,' Hopper's 'Nighthawks,' Seurat's 'A Sunday Afternoon....', Picasso's The Old Guitarist... the list goes on.  It appears that all the impressionists are represented, topped off by Rembrandt and the old masters, Egyptian antiquities -- virtually everything that should be in an art museum is here.
