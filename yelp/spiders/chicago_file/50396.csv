Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place broke my heart into pieces.  My wife took me here after she had been here for a work outing because she thought I'd like it.  This place was completely amazing and knocked my socks off.  First, paella is one of my favorite dishes.  They made some of the most delicious paella I had ever had.  We ordered so many dishes from here I couldn't name them all, but the short rib, bacon wrapped dates, calamari frito, chicken paella were huge stand outs.  The cocktails and sangrias were delicious and addictive.  I don't like sangria, at all, but I loved theirs.  The service and atmosphere was spot on.  I loved this place so much I recommended it to so many friends and family members, anytime someone said they were looking for tapas this was the place to go.  They were consistent and delicious and I put them in my rotation immediately.
