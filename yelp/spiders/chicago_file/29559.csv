Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Long wait was anticipated so called ahead an hour early and got on the waitlist. Only had to wait about 15mins at the restaurant thanks to their system. However, I had to wait an hour for food and when your food comes out cold after all that waiting, it sucks. Flavors were okay but nothing to write home about. Not really deep dish. Was visiting Chicago so didn't get to try any other places but won't be coming back to this one.
