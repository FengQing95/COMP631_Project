Art Institute of Chicago////Wow! This is a great museum to visit! I had no idea how many famous pieces were housed here and at $25 GA it was absolutely worth it. They had such a variety of art from different times and various styles. Â This place is deceptively spacious! You could easily spend all day. I was lucky enough to visit while the Obama Portraits were being displayed while they're on tour across the U.S.
