Art Institute of Chicago////An amazing museum set in the heart of downtown Chicago. The museum itself is beautiful and is a wonderful place to spend the day. The artwork is incredible and you could easily lose track of time walking through the extensive galleries. This impressive museum is state of the art and you won't want to miss it! Afterwards you can walk out and stroll through Millennium Park as it's a great place to take your family and friends.
