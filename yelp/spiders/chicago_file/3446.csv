The Purple Pig////The brunch menu was so unique to the style of food they serve and was hands down delicious. Everything coming out of that kitchen I wanted. Chef Jimmy Bannos Jr. is killing it in that kitchen. You know someone is a great chef when they make food you wouldn't necessarily want look and smell amazing!
