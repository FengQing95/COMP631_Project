Art Institute of Chicago////This is a must while in town, i was lucky to be in town the last week of the Impressionism, Fashion, and Modernity exhibit. It was very well done with stunning pieces, the only negative of the visit was while in the exhibit, the security guard would not let me take a photo of "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte" (the painting from ferris Bulers day off) because it was a part of the exhibit.... that was a total bummer. but i was able to take some other stunning photos of other pieces outside of the exhibit ( without flash)
