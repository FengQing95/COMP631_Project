Little Goat Diner////Stopped by for brunch with another couple. We were really happy with the menu options. The kitchen was very accommodating of my wife's dietary restrictions. The cocktails were well balanced and the beer selections was impressive. We sat outside and the service was fast. Would definitely go back.
