Little Goat Diner////From the FALL IN A GLASS cocktail to the BREAKFAST SPAGHETTI, the FRIED CHICKEN, and FAT ELVIS WAFFLES, you will definitely walk away with an excellent experience.  There are so many flavors and interesting concoctions that sound rather weird at first, but as soon as you dive in, you fully understand.  This is probably my favorite dining experience at the moment.  Hosts are always accommodating and it helps that they now take limited reservations, mostly on weekdays.
