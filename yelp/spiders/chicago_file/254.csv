Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Came here for brunch today and was very pleased with our experience. We had to wait 25 min (Sunday morning at 8.30) and were seated promptly when our table was ready. I ordered the corn beef Benny while my friend ordered the Denver skillet. Our food came out quickly and was delicious. Our server checked on us multiple times to make sure we had everything we need so service was great. Overall a great experience, will definitely be back!!!
