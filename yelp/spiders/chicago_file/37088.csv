Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Just excellent from the food and drinks to the ambiance and the location -- everything was a huge hit for us.  We were in Chicago for the weekend somewhat unexpectedly and couldn't come by reservations.  We went in about 20 min after they opened and walked right up to two seats at the bar.  Seated next to some random but great conversationalists who told us our bartender was a spy - and he played it up.  They called him Ozzy (maybe real name Bradley?) and he just went with it and sang a little diddy for their meal.  He was witty and lots of fun so high marks for fantastic and personable staff.
