Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I don't get it Chicago, I really don't.  There isn't a comparison to be made between NY pizza (or, just pizza, for short) and Chicago deep dish.  How do you compare the two?  How can you possibly say one is better than the other?  It's like saying chocolate is better than football or unicorns are better than rainbows.  It's not comparable.
