Little Goat Diner////Long wait, expensive menu. However, fantastic food and huge portions. Vibrant atmosphere. Nothing on the menu is boring, either. Everything has a twist to it. Friendly wait staff, but usually too busy to be very attentive. Overall, great experience. But call ahead to streamline.
