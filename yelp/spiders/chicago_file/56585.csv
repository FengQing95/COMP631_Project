Smoque BBQ////Four of us first-timers went for lunch yesterday - and it was tip top. I've always been a pulled pork guy but I went brisket and it was a very wise choice. Perhaps the ribs would have been even wiser but I am no Jedi yet. Â Mac and cheese was above average, barbecue beans were amazing, cornbread was spot on. BBQ joints keep a line coming for their meats though - and Smoque's is some of the best anywhere.
