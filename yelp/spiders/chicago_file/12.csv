Little Goat Diner////Went to The Little Goat Monday around 11:30 for brunch.  The hostess told us it would be 15 minutes and they would text us when our table was ready - very cool service by the way.  Just as soon as we took off our coats the hostess came over and said our table was ready.  Very nice to not have to wait.  Let me just say the food was fabulous.  Breakfast is served all day which is nice since we got a late start.  I had the Bull's eye French toast.  It had an egg soft baked into each slice and came  topped with sweet onion brioche, bbq maple syrup and gooseberries.  I took a bite and could hardly speak.  It was one of the most incredible things I've ever had.  My friend had the shrimp and grits with braised pistachio and brussel sprout leaves.  I tried it and it was also incredible.  The server was great and knew the menu well.  A manager was walking around checking on tables making sure everything was good.  It was more than good.  It was way beyond good.  I can't recommend this place enough.  I can't wait to go back and try it for dinner.  It's only a couple of block from the Morgan el stop on the green line.
