Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Anyways, the food is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! I dont even like steak let alone ever finish it and guess what - i LOVED it and finished it, doown to the boooone. We ordered bone marrow and crab stuffed avocado for appetizers. Â Both were excellent, the bone marrow didnt have enough marrow on it but it was delicious! The marinated onions that came w it were excellent too. For entrees we got bone-in steak, rib-eye and beef stroganof! Boy, the bone-in was unbelievably juicy and so full of flavor. I couldnt believe how much I liked it and kept eating it! I usually do like 5 bites n push it aside. The beef stroganoff , our friend, proclaimed to have the best tasting pasta hes ever had! The rib eye was great as well. For sides we got cream spinach - phenomenal, roasted tomatoes-best tomatoes ever!, corn - sweet and creamy!, and mashed potatoes- delicious! The entire meal was just unbelievable from presentation to the taste - we can not wait to go back! Lille Rose drink w st germaine was the right choice-sweet and citruicy and super fresh.
