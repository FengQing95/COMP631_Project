Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My girlfriends and I came here on a Sunday after hearing very positive things about this place. The service and decor was wonderful, but the food? Meh. We ordered a total of 4 tapas and then the chicken paella. None of the tapas were spectacular except for the short rib which was phenomenal. The chicken paella was so bland. I had to add so much salt and pepper just to make it edible!! Definitely not worth a trip. We won't be coming back.
