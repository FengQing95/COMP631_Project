Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////They deserve all five stars and more. My family and I have been here multiple times for special occasions and the service and food is impeccable every time. Their BYOW (bring your own wine) policy is unique. You can bring one bottle for every two people and the corkage fee is just to share a glass with another table. The steak is amazing but the Cesar salad is one of the best things I've ever eaten. I would highly recommend Bavette's, but make sure to make a reservation far in advance.
