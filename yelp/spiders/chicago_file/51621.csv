Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! The food is great (brunch AND dinner); the service is fantastic; the ambiance is neat, and the sangria is perfect. Not a lot more you can ask for in a restaurant! It's a blast to go here with a group of friends, because you can try a lot of food and share pitchers of the different kinds of perfect sangria.
