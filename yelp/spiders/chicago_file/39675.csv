Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I am so happy my husband and I decided to dine here while we were visiting Chicagoland. It was absolutely perfect! The servers here are caring and professional. Our server made sure are glasses were never empty and the table was never crowded. The food and drinks are exceptional. To begin they give you the most wonderfully delicious bread. I ordered a martini that was worth the price and my husband loved his old fashioned. For dinner I had the filet which was melt in my mouth perfection. The Mac n cheese is to die for. My husband had the dry aged ribeye and was in heaven. We split the chocolate pie for dessert and I'm so glad we did not skip it, even though we were stuffed it was totally worth ordering!
