Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Great service. There was a short wait. They said 5-10 minutes and it was less than five. Perfect location just across from Millenium Park. They have an interesting selection of french toasts like banana bread, and red velvet cake, along with yummy egg and hash skillets. Â
