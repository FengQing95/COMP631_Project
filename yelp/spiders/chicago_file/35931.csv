Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The service is unbelievable and the food is stupefying. We started off with the Foie Gras Terrine which was absolutely amazing. She had the Steak Frites and I had the 6oz Filet Mignon - both were perfectly cooked and flavored to perfection. Serious, Â my-eyes-rolled-back-in-my-skull, perfection. It's only been a few days since and I'm already trying to figure out an excuse to go back. Even the table bread and butter is great.
