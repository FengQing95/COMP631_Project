Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Made a reservation and went in for a late supper. The exterior was very welcoming to me when I saw the sign that said BAR. When you enter the doorway, there is a little corridor prior to arriving at the front desk, and I think this was the waiting area for people without reservations. Arrived a little early, so the hostess advised us to wait at the bar. The wait was at most 5 minutes, and we were directed to our table. The stroll to our table made us realize how big this establishment was.
