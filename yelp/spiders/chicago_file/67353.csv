Little Goat Diner////Our Sunday Brunch at 11:15 am had a 2 hour wait.  I was coming with some friends from the suburbs and we had other things to do while we waiting or I would have never even gone.  I do not wait 2 hours for a diner.  Or anywhere else for that matter.  The wait ended up being close to 1.5 hours, I guess that is better than 2 hours, but certainly not a short wait.
