Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Came here with my fianc√© and my parents. Overall we had a completely wonderful experience and meal. This place is a total gem. Some highlights: The roasted chicken might sound slightly boring, but it is NOT. It is amazing! It's half a chicken, the skin is crispy yet the meat is super tender, and it comes with this delectable pan jus with roasted garlic cloves that melt in your mouth. Get this! For a "side" I ordered the wedge salad. Well! It can very easily feed 3 people, and was a huge hit. Everything else we got was superb. Only gripe? Well, $16 for a martini kinda rubs me the wrong way, and it was smaller than last time I was here. I mean, come on. I know this place is fancy and pricey but $16 is plain ridiculous (martinis are my favorite drink but I just can't recommend spending that much on one). Other than that blip, I highly, highly recommend this place. It's not somewhere we'd go often because of how expensive it is, but for a once-in-a-while treat or special occasion, it's my go-to choice in the city.
