Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Other items we ordered included a medium Caesar salad with grilled chicken for $8.75 and an order of the "BuffaLou" chicken wings for $8.95. They were alright too. The Caesar was made with Romaine lettuce, lean chicken strips, chopped tomato, shaved Parmesan cheese (a healthy amount), and crunchy croutons tossed in Caesar dressing. Six wings came to an order of the BuffaLou wings (on the apps menu) with celery and ranch dressing on the side. These were basically your standard buffalo wings that were slightly spicy.
