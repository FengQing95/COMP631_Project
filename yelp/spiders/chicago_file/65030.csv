Smoque BBQ////All week I've been craving BBQ and today I finally satisfied those cravings. Sometimes you have to travel for good food and let me tell you it was totally worth the trip. 40 minutes drive in Chicago traffic to dine (get to go food) at Smoque BBQ. Today I had the pleasure of killing an order of baby back ribs, Texas sausage and the best Brisket in the city with Memphis style bbq sauce (which is needed, food so good that you don't need sauce) I encourage everyone that if you want some really good bbq try Smoque BBQ. If you can't make it to the full service restaurant they have a scaled down version at the Revival Food Hall
