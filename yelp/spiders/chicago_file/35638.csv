Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We were here celebrating a birthday, so I thought they might bring out some kind of special birthday treat - however, since we didn't order dessert (we had an entire cake awaiting us elsewhere), they brought out just a lone lit candle on a naked plate.  The candle was a nice gesture, but it was actually kind of sad.  How about a scoop of ice cream or *something* to stick the candle in?  Other than that semi-weird end note, the meal was excellent.
