Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Now I understand that things happen, but we had 10 people expecting a dinner... who were in town from all over... expecting Cafe Ba-Ba-Reebas service. We've heard great reviews from multiple Chicago locals, only to get there with no notice of a restaurant shut down. Not a call, not an open table update. NOTHING.  We waited until till 10 pm to eat dinner for no reason. In the area, no place is open much later than that, aka we had 10 hungry people with no place to eat.
