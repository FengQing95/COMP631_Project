Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Out of the 6 we tried, the winners to me were the beef empanada and grilled shrimp. Everything else was underwhelming and slightly mediocre. I was kind of shocked at the correlation between portion size and price. It was $5-6 for 1 medium sized empanada. Maybe I like to eat more than a bit when I share my food.
