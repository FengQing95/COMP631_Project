The Purple Pig////When we finally sat down, I was very excited because I remembered how good the food was when I last visited 5~ years ago. The ambiance was busy but not toooo noisy. The seats were pretty close together, but not overwhelmingly so. Food all came out pretty quickly, and the service was great, though the explanation of different foods were hurried and apathetic. The wine also came out only after several dishes were served, which was disappointing because I thought the whole point was the pair the food with wine.
