Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband and I ate here on our last night in Chicago.  What a perfect way to put the finishing touches on a great weekend!  We had 10:15 pm reservations (prime time reservations are tough to get, so plan early in advance.). Our table was not quite ready so we had a cocktail at the bar while we were waiting.  The bartenders are skilled and modern without trying to be one of those trendy mixologists.
