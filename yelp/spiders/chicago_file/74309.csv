Little Goat Diner////We waited an hour and a half and it was worth every minute. Everything I tried was solid. Stand outs included the blueberry pancakes with oatmeal crumble and the goat chili--which had a wonderfully flavorful broth and tasty non-greasy crumbled goat meat. Between the hashbrowns (which apparently had cheese in them, but I couldn't detect any) and the tempura mashed potato I would go with the tempura mashed potato. I tried the walnut sour spritz which was perfectly balanced--a little sweet, a little boozy, a little nutty. It actually wasn't sour at all. My entree was the Parathas burrito which I'd get again. It was extremely filling and not too terribly heavy. This experience makes me want to try one of Chef Lizard's other restaurants.
