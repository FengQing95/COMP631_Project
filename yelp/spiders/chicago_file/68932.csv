Little Goat Diner////This place is must to go!! It was my friend and I first time here and we enjoyed every bite of it! We ordered the pork belly scallion pancake and the Korean burger. It is to die for!! The meat was very tender and juicy. The scallion was marinated perfectly! We loved both dishes but we definitely loved the pork belly more.
