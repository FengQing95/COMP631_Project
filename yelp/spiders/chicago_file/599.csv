Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Awesome breakfast place. I went here twice during my visit to Chicago. The prices are reasonable, the portions are good,  and the service is pretty good. They get very busy around lunch (after breakfast) and aren't as attentive.  When they do walk by, they do provide good service.
