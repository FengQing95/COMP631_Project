Little Goat Diner////The caesar salad, was the best caesar I have had in my life.  If this was the only thing I had ordered i would have rated this place five stars and been done with it.  The skirt steak as a main was very good BUT it came with very little steak.  this was closer to a steak salad than a steak, the caramel sauce actually works.  the deep fat fried mashed potatoes could be so much better but they serve it with this sweet sauce which makes it almost like a jelly donut.  I wasn't a big fan.
