Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////great atmosphere, wonderful food and fast service. Only issue I had was at the door, when I first arrived, we did not have a reservation so I asked how long will it be and they said, well we can't really tell you. I then asked how many people are in front of us and they said again it's our policy not to tell you. You may have to wait at least 2 hours, though many tables were empty, we were about to walk out but decided to eat at the bar. After we ate, they texted me that the table was ready...almost 2 hours later
