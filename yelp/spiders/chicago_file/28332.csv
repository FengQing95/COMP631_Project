Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Hour long wait and although it was pretty good i have to agree I think there's better deep dish pizza in Chicago. While the pizza had lots of toppings, I thought both would be deeper dish (we ordered a large so maybe that's hard to make deep?). But mainly I was disappointed in the lack of flavor. It seems like neither their sauce nor sausage has any italian spices in it.
