Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou's is , in my opinion, the BEST pizza hands down. Some may differ.. but growing up in Wilmette, Lou's has always been the #1 choice in our family. The lake location in Wilmette seems to have the most consistently awesome za. However, i reside in river north now so i frequent the Wells street location. Â  It tends to be hit or miss with this store. Not sure why. Sometimes I'll get a za to DIE for. And others.. meh, not so much. It's always good but when they get it on point, it'll knock your socks off. I am a deep dish cheese and spinach girl. Sometimes I'll get crazy and order sausage also. But i am usually return back to my old faithful, cheese & spinach. The thin is pretty good too.
