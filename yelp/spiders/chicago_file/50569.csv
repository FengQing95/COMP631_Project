Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Heard a lot of hype from Caf√© Ba-Ba-Ree-ba but never really had an occasion to go here until yesterday, and was very pleasantly surprised after the experience. Not only because of the flavors and presentation of the food, but also because we surprisingly didn't break the budget doing it, spending around $20 per person(I was fully expecting to spend twice as much). First thing to note is that this place is gigantic. It has like 5 different rooms, two semi-floors, walls of bread and bundles of ham swinging from the ceiling. They really do try to capture the dim but bustling atmosphere of a restaurant in Barcelona, and in my opinion they do so fairly successfully. Ordered 7 tapas between 3 people, including the warm potato and onion omelette, spicy potatoes with tomato aioli, beef empanada, chicken and ham croquetas, buttermilk-fried chicken thighs, seared Spanish sausages, and skewered chicken + chorizo sausage. All the dishes were good, though my personal favorites were the potato dishes, the croquets, and the skewered Spanish sausages. The beef empanada was also good though for a single $6 empanada I would probably wait for happy hour. Speaking of which, they have a solid happy hour here, where their dishes are priced as they were when they first opened 30 years ago, meaning you essentially get 50% off a lot of their favorites(patatas bravas, empanadas, roast dates, chicken & ham croquetas, pintxos, etc.) along with $16 pitchers of Sangria. It's every day from 4pm-6pm, along with Friday sand Saturdays from 10pm-midnight as well, and you can definitely get full off of $10-15 or so if you come by around this time.
