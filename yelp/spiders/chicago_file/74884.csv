Little Goat Diner////The assortment of fresh baked breads, including an olive loaf and a parmesan crisp. These paired perfectly with the sriracha butter and the goat liver mousse. Other starter dishes included a PHENOMENAL tuna poke. I tried to restrict myself to one piece of bread, but... well. I couldn't.
