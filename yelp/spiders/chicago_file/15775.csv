Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have never gone into the restaurant to eat Lou's but have ordered it in at least a handful of times since I moved here. And it STILL beats all the other deep dish pizzas I've had (3 other popular places). Hands down one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten. The Lou is my favorite by far.
