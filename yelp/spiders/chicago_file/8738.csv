Art Institute of Chicago////Expect to spend a minimum of three to four hours here, depending on what you choose to see. Winter is especially great to sneak in when the tourists are elsewhere and you're out of the cold. It's easy to make it an all day event. Cafes on site serve sandwiches, salads, and drinks, though the prices aren't cheap.
