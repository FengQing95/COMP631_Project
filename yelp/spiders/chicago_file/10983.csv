Art Institute of Chicago////First class museum situated next to a beautiful park. I visited on Bank of America's free weekend about an hour before closing (yes, poor timing but must make do with what time I had left). There was no wait. The museum is a little bit of a maze but if you grab a map and pick a spot, it's pretty easy to find an employee who can give you directions. If you're in a rush for time and have no particular preference for the style/time period - then check the back of the museum map for the top 10 must-see artworks.
