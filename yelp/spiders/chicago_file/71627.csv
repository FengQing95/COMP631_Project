Little Goat Diner////I don't really get all the rave reviews. If you're looking for good diner food at an affordable price, go elsewhere. First of all, our server let us look at our menus for maybe 5-7 minutes and then came to our table and said something to the tune of, "okay, time to go." Didn't ask us if we were ready and seemed to want to rush us, which isn't what you want to feel in a diner.
