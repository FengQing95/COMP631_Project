Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Place was packed, and I can see why! Seated within 15 minutes, attentive service, and oh my goodness, the pizza! The pizza! Their famed sausage really is delicious, and the ripe roma tomatoes are sweet and succulent. Thank goodness I don't live near this place, otherwise I'd be a big fatty from the heart stopping gobs of cheesy deliciousness.
