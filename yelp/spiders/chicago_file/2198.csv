The Purple Pig////It's the Purple Pig. Seriously, this should be the only thing written here. This place is a Chicago staple that never ceases to impress. We have been patrons of the Pig since it first opened God knows how many years ago. It should be noted though that this is not the place to go for a quick lunch by yourself. To truly experience this restaurant you need to come with a group of people and each order 1-2 plates of food to share. You will never leave hungry, and if you are a wine drinker you will never walk out unsatisfied. They have a newer item on the menu that we tried which was caviar and potato ice cream. Weirdest, most delicious plate I have consumed in recent memory. If you havent been to the Pig - go. If you have been, then my guess is you arent reading this review because you already know how amazing it is.
