Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm a Chicago girl who grew up on Chicago pizza (only for special occasions as a youngster). I used to make my own, lived and ate pizza in NY, and in Napoli, the home of pizza... Lou Malnati's is one of my favorite places because the servers are great, pizza (the deep dish) is worth the wait, and it's a cool look.
