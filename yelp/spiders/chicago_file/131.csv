Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Number one great coffee, always important in the morning.  Number two, the menu is huge and well priced when you factor in the portion sizes.  We work nearby and have done both breakfast and lunch here.  Never been disappointed so far.  The service is outstanding and the manager never fails to recognize us.  Quickly becoming our favorite spot for food, just wish they were open later.
