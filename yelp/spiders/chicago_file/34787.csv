Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Ok, ok, I'm onto the main event... the food.  All of it was tasty!  We started with the salmon tartare, which was to die for.  Perfectly seasoned and delicious.  I got the steak frites for my main course.  It was cooked to perfection and perfectly seasoned.  We also got the elote to share, which we all loved.  It was just a more upscale version of the classic street food, but the twist on it was perfect.  All in all, I will definitely be back here again.
