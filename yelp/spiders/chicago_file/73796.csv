Little Goat Diner////Fun, interesting food options.  I went there around 9:00am on a Saturday and actually had no wait!  The fat Elvis waffles were scrumptious, orange juice was good and hash browns were ok but not out of this world where I'd have to order them again.  The server was nice and attentive but probably fairly new as he seemed rather rehearsed on his script.
