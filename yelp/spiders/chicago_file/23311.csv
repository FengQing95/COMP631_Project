Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered the Malnati salad, as well as "The Lou" with sausage added on top (chunks, not crumbled pieces covering the top) with Malnati's World Famous Buttercrust. The salad was absolutely delicious, especially because of the housemade dressing that it had. The pizza itself, however, was extremely underwhelming. The buttercrust really had no flavor - it just felt like we were eating plain butter. The tomatoes weren't very sweet, but they were okay. The sausage, however, was delicious. I wish there had been more of it on top.
