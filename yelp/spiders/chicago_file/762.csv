Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Picked this place due to high yelp rating and being in the area.  Loooong wait in the freezing cold on a Friday morning to eat here.  WORTH IT! Four of us (3 adults one child) had veggie omelette (yawn & not mine!) fig & walnut multigrain pancakes (sissy's), chocolate chip silver dollar pancakes (niece) and mine, the Berry Bliss French Toast which i could eat once a week if this place were closer. Soooo good! We all loved our food.  Order taken fairly quickly given how busy the place was, and coffee refills offered regularly.  YUM!
