Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food was 4 stars. Tapas always can satisfy me because you get to try so many food without getting full quickly on one dish. However, the service was a 3 star. To start with, there was a big piece of paper (looks like a champion wrap" next to my feet when I sat down. Then after we ordered, my passion fruit sangria came in after two tapas were already on the table. I believe a good server always know that the drink should arrive before any dishes. And these is also the water issue; my water glass was empty for at least 40 mins before the server noticed it. I would come back for the food but hopefully the service gets better. It is a 3.5 star.
