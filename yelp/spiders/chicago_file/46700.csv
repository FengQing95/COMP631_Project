Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I was here with friends on a visit to Chicago. There was a long wait and I appreciated that they took my phone number so they could text me when our table was ready. We went down the street and had drinks while we waited. There are a million amazing sounding items on the menu so we did what I'm sure most people do and way over ordered. Our server was great and did finally advise us to slow our roll a bit. We all got to giggling as food just kept coming and coming. Highlights for me were the short rib dish and the seafood paella but there wasn't anything I tried that I didn't like. We got a great wine suggestion from our server as well. Overall a great and memorable dining experience. BTW, I'd highly recommend coming here with a group so you can really explore the menu - I definitely wouldn't have felt like I got the full experience if I had only tried 1 or 2 dishes.
