Little Goat Diner////Anyway. The chef from Girl and the Goat prepares each dish here in the kitchen, and you can literally watch the magic happen in the open kitchen! I had a fabulous time watching as they prepared each dish, and then enjoying the food as well. I could only stay for a few of the dishes, but my favorite was definitely the goat empanada. For anyone dining at Girl and the Goat, I highly suggest you order it! I don't even care for goat (it's too gamey for me), but there is absolutely NOT gamey-ness to this, and it's SO delicious!
