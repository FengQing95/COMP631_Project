Little Goat Diner////I ordered this sandwich with turkey and ham with their "special" sauce which was basically just mayo... They put waaaaay too much on, I could barely eat it. Â Also, for 13 bucks you think that w any sandwich u would get fries, but nope, everything is la carte. Not sure what the big buzz is about this place, I wouldn't return. Oh, I will say that our service was good though! We had a sweet lil waitress who was a complete doll!
