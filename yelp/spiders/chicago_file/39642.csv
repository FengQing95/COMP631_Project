Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Everything about Bavette's is excellent.  The decor and ambiance are great.  The restaurant is reminiscent of a speakeasy or a wainscoted library.  It is a dark and inviting space with rich wood and exposed brick.  The drinks are expertly crafted, the waitstaff is attentive, and the food is to die for.  Not only are the steaks amazing, but the sides are extremely rich and flavorful.  Probably also a thousand calories a piece containing no less than three sticks of butter, but it's worth it.
