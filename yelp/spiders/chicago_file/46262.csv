Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came with a small group for a friends birthday dinner. Much better than the first time. Still loud but that just means it's OK for you and your friends to be loud too. I enjoyed every item I tasted (stuffed mushrooms and the goat cheese with tomato sauce being my standout favorites) and I especially enjoyed the sangria. Service was pretty good and the bill won't leave you clutching your heart from shock.
