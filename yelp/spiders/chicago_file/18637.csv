Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was on a mission to try the best pizza joints in Chicago. I was only going to be there for three days so I had to be meticulous with my selections and...Lou Malnati's was the winner! (Pequod's and Gino's were the other two I tried) The buttery crust was outstanding especially because it was crispy on the edges. The tomato sauce was exquisite, every element of this pizza blew me away. This was exactly the experience I wanted before I left Chicago. Sure, it might be touristy but its family owned and the service was wonderful. It's so good, don't miss out on giving it a try. FYI I cry sometimes because Lou Malnati's isn't in LA
