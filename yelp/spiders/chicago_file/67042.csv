Little Goat Diner////Do you hate the lines? Do you ponder "this is a diner, I should be seated and eating my food already?" It's because you don't go at 7 AM! Hate Wednesdays? Treat yourself to some Little Goat before work! You run in the morning? That's absurd, just stuff your face with Asian-diner fusion goodness and forget about it. I do warn you that the kitchen folk are also not morning people. Ok maybe Stephanie but that's because she's Superwoman. So my meals have been a bit sub-par at 7 AM - as in why is this cold? But the coffee keeps coming in a mug I want to steal (but haven't I promise... yet). Being Asian, I am not 100% behind some of her fusions, but if you go for diner food fare I'm sure you will be happy.
