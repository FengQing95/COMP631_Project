Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Based on the breathless reviews on here for Wildberry I decided to try it for a late breakfast. First, the good:  this place turned over tables like a well-oiled machine, and our initial quote of a 40 minute wait turned out be more like 15 minutes.  There were a ton of options on the menu, and it's great that they let you choose pancakes to go along with any meal instead of hash browns and toast.  Also, it's refreshing to see a place that actually has hash browns instead of home fries.
