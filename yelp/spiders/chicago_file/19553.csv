Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place was so good, as soon as we got back from Chicago I ordered Pizzas to have shipped to us.  They were so good! The service was fantastic.  The pizza we ordered was Lous specialty.  The crust is amazing, the sausage, and all around great quality ingredients make this place special.  Seriously you need to try this, and if you won't find yourself in chicago, order it shipped!
