Little Goat Diner////Great spot for a celebration with 4 big eating guys and a gal. Great cocktails and nachos to start. Good selection of beers too. The best fried chicken my husband ever had...and he's had a lot! Love Â the pork belly pancake and Los drowned Sammy. Amazing to come and have no wait and good service too!
