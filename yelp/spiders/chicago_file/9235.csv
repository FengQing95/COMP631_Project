Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute is one of my favorite buildings in Chicago.  The architecture of the exterior of the building can give one a sense of pride in their city.  Once you've taken the obligatory photos on the steps and in front of the giant lions outside, step inside and let yourself get lost.
