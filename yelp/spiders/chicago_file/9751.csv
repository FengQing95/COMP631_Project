Art Institute of Chicago////Certainly a surprisingly elite art museum. The building itself is beautiful and clean, not to mention a staple attraction to Chicago itself, and all the art is perfectly and tastefully displayed. The special exhibits are always fascinating and top tier (we're here for the "Van Gogh's Bedrooms" exhibit now). The staff & security are also generally friendly and very helpful. If you're in Chicago this museum is a must.
