Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I had the Veggie Omelet and it was just okay to me. It all just tasted like regular breakfast food that you could get anywhere. It wasn't bad but it just wasn't the amazing breakfast I was expecting to have based on the reviews and the wait...Maybe I just didnt order the right thing?
