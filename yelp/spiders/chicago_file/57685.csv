Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Another great Chicago find with awesome open patio seating and spacing to accommodate COVID-19 changes. Our server took great care of us making recommendations when appropriate and checking back often to make sure we always had plenty of tapas on the table and on the way. We stuck with the half pitcher of classic red sangria, which was just right for our party of two. Â Next time, I want to come back hungrier ;)
