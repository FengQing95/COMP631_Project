Little Goat Diner////Went in for an early dinner.  Tried the parathas burrito - house made flatbread was golden brown, light with a pleasant chew.  Sunny side up eggs, avocado, beans and hot sauce is a solid combination.  Hash browns were good, little heavy on the cheese, but overall very satisfying.  Companion ordered the tonkatsu - gigantic pork cutlet, pounded thin and fried to perfection.  Simple white bread with Asian bbq and cabbage melded together perfectly.
