Smoque BBQ////So tasty! One thing I really appreciate about dinning in is that you order and someone sears you. This is really great to help avoid people sitting and holding a table before they even order. I think it times out right we waited standing inside and just before our food came out,we were able to eat at a table. Ribs and pulled pork were really awesome. I'd give the Mac and cheese an ok...too creamy and not enough cheesy for my taste. The serving size of the fries is crazy big. I wish we would have shared. They had pecan bread pudding tonight which we took to go. It was really awesome. I'm glad we didn't pass it up!
