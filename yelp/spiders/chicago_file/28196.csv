Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered those in to our hotel. They recommend that you order it uncut so it keeps all the flavor, we ordered it uncut cause we didn't have a way to cut it at our hotel room. Be sure when ordering, you let them know what condiments you want, silverware, and how many plates. They included more than what we needed which was appreciated.
