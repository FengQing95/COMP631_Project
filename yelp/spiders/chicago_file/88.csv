Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I consider myself a breakfast connoisseur, and I was incredibly impressed with Wildberry Cafe. The Intelligentsia coffee drink menu looked fantastic, but I had stupidly stopped at Starbucks beforehand so didn't try it out. However, I did try the pancakes -- amazing! My friend got upsold into the signature berry pancakes with vanilla drizzle, and was not disappointed when a beautiful stack of pancakes appeared at the table. I had two eggs over-easy that were cooked well (slightly on the runny side) and delicious tiramisu pancakes. The service was friendly and fast, and even though we stuck around awhile (it was a weekday morning so we weren't holding up the line) to catch up, we did not feel like we were rushed out. Overall a great value for a delicious meal!
