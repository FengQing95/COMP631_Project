Smoque BBQ////My husband likes to make runs to here whenever he has the chance. We always get the baby back ribs without the sauce. SO TASTY EVEN WITHOUT SAUCE and I usually don't like it dry. I don't think the sauce makes it better either. I can finish a full slab all by myself and I'm a small girl.
