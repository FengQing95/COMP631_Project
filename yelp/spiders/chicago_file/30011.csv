Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The deep dish itself was tasty too. I liked The Lou more than The Malnati Chicago Classic simply because I'm not a very meaty person. I also don't love to eat cheese... so the triple cheese on The Lou was a little much for me. The tomato sauce that Lou Malnati uses is homemade and so so delicious. If you read the description on their menu, their vine tomatoes are handpicked from California (or something like that). Note that they have suggested portion sizes and I advise you to listen to that. For two, a medium was WAY too big (my boyfriend claimed he could finish it). A small would have been perfect for us and maybe even a little bit leftover still.
