Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We also ordered the Â bone marrow, which included three large bones and plenty of rich, delicious marrow accompanied by plenty of crispy toast. Our main was of course, the 22 oz Classic Chicago-cut Ribeye, which was a heaping cut of beef. My only complaint was that we ordered it rare, but to my chagrin it actually came out medium-rare to almost medium...quite a disappointing turn of events. We didn't send it back because it wasn't horrendously overcooked, but Bavette's loses a "star" for a their overcooked steak.
