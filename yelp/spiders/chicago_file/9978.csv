Art Institute of Chicago////So I'm laying it all out... here's my personal testimony of the AIC I have longed to see and visit for about 10 years now. My good friend went to UIC. She would wax on and on about the wonders that were housed in the AIC.... to motivate myself not to forget this wonderful museum, I bought myself an AIC mug that had a Georges Seurat painting on it.
