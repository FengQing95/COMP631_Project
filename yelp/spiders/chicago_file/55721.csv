Smoque BBQ////I have a gluten allergy and am always a little leery when my husband and I go out to eat. As a precaution, I always call ahead to see if the restaurant can offer gluten free options and if the kitchen is familiar. After sitting on hold for a bit (you could tell they were busy) the women on the phone was pleasant and not flustered by my questions at all.
