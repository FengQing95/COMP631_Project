Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Had breakfast here with the girlfriend and it was fantastic. We split an omelette an subbed a side of signature pancakes for $1 (instead of toast) and it was plenty of food. The Rutherford omelette was fantastic as we substituted feta cheese for goat cheese and adds avocado.
