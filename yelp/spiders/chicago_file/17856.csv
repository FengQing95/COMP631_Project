Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I used to work across the street from Lou and usually order for lunch. Many occasions I recommend it for all staff when we wanted to share lunch also. The pizzas are always so delicious and you can taste the freshness in the toppings. The only thing was that it takes quite a bit when you order the whole pizzas. One time we thought the person we sent to order the pizza got lost because it took an hour for him to come back.
