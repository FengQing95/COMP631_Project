Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Many people told me that if your in Chicago you have to try the deep disk at Malnati's and boy were they right. This place was amazing, from the meat to the cheese to the crust! The wine and bear selection was good but not great and the place was mobbed even on a Monday night but they have a full menu at the bar so that cuts the wait time down considerably.
