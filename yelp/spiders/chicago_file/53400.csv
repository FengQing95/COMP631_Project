Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Met my daughter here for dinner.  Traffic from Rosemont was horrible but once we started trying the yummy tapas selections, I forgot about the commute.  We'll rate our selections!  1-bacon wrapped dates, 2-beef tenderloin and blue cheese, 3-chicken thighs, 4-goat cheese in tomato sauce w/garlic bread.  Dessert coming now...gotta go!
