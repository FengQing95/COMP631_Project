Smoque BBQ////So let's get to the good stuff--the food! The BBQ here is amazing. Ribs that fall of the bone without that "boiled" taste. You can tell that they cook it low and slow. The BBQ chicken is the moistest I've had and and the skin is so crispy. The best part is that when you cut into the chicken all the juices come gushing out so you just know that it won't be dry! The brisket here is the best I've had in the city. Nice and juicy..smokey without being too smokey.
