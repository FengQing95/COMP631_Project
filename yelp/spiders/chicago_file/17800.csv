Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Thanks Malnati's for catering our son's graduation party! We are from NYC, so a bit snobbish about our pizza. We had malnati's provide several deep dish pies, salad, sodas, some baked pasta dishes for a few pizza-haters, and an array of Italian cookies for dessert. They guided me through the order process, showed up at the hotel on time, had all the utensils, cups, plates etc.. in short, excellent service. The pizza was piping hot, I don't know how they did it. The salad was cool and crispy. And the price was reasonable. I highly recommend their catering service.
