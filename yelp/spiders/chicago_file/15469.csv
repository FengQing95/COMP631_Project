Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is pretty good pizza, I had the all veggie deep dish pizza. I think my expectations might have been a little too high. But their chicken wings were surprisingly good, they had some of the best buffalo sauce I have ever tasted. Plenty of seating, not an issue getting a table.
