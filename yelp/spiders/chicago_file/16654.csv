Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Quality deep dish pizza. My husband and I went around 6 p.m. on Saturday night and it was already getting crowded. We were lucky to get a table for two outside pretty quickly, but by the time that we were done with our meal, there was a line down the block and the wait for a table was nearly an hour. For those waiting, however, the hostesses were very organized and even allowed tables to place their orders before getting seated. Once we were seated, the pizza took about forty minutes, but our waitress was honest about the cooking time, and we were able to enjoy the spinach salad while our pizza cooked.
