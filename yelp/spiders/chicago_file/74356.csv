Little Goat Diner////Im spending only a few meals worth of time in Chicago and went looking for 'Girl and Goat' on a friend's suggestion.  I know what you're thinking, this isn't a review for Girl and Goat...But just so we're clear...This place has a giant spinning goat head on the roof and very little additional signage.  If I wanted to front like I was another restaurant maybe I could spin a giant golden M in front of my house and call it a McDougals Diner.   I didn't discover this major red flag until I commiserated with a local on how bad my food was.
