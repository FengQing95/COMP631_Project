Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I need to give this place another try because it's a Chicago favorite to many and I didn't love my first experience. You see, the group you go with makes alll the difference in the world. It's served tapas style and if your table isn't hiving with your tastebuds you could end up with some mediocre combos.
