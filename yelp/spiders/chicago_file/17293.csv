Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My friends and I came for a pre-dinner dinner (don't judge) with the goal of "just one" slice and maybe a beer but I soon realized that it was all silly diet talk. After one forkful of that ooey gooey cheesy magic, I couldn't stop. Not only did we finish a pie that was probably meant to feed an army, but I wanted to order another one and another one and another one.
