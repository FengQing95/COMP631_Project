Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Other than the "ribs," everything else seemed to be priced okay.  The desserts were small and only cost $2.75, which was perfect.  I wish all restaurants did that.  By the time I've had my fill of dinner, I don't have room for a slice of cake the size of my head - I just want a little sweet taste!
