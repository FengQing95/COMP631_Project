Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Last Saturday, I went to the Malnati's carry out in Palatine expecting the usual delicious pizza I know & love. The pizza was horrible. It tasted like they completely forgot to add any spices to the sauce and just used bland tomato sauce on the crust. Now I'm back home in Chicago & the memory of that flavorless pizza keeps me from visiting their establishment. With so many delicious pizza choices in this city, it doesn't make sense to take the risk
