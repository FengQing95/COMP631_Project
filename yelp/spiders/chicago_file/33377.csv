Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////the food was simply amazing.  i had the short rib papardelle. i am not a particular fan of red meat but it was mind blowing.  it had a slight carmelization to the outside and the meat was so tender and juicy.  the pasta was clearly hand made and the sauce outstanding.  we started out with the foie gras.  i thought it was a little pricy at 18.50 but changed my mind once it came. it was served wrapped in the duck fat - which sounds gross but is actually amazing. it was also served with blackberry sauce.
