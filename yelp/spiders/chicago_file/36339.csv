Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We kind of hung around the bar until 2 booths opened up and we squeezed our groups into them. We ordered some French press coffee, a raspberry cheesecake and chocolate pie, also a couple others I don't remember at the other table. Everything was just so succulently delicious. The coffee was probably some of the best I've ever had, cream and sugar would have polluted this nectar of the gods.
