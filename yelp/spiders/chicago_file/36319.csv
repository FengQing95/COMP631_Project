Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Peppered Duck and Goat Cheese Terrine with Apricot Mustard and Toast:  As my sister does enjoy the texture of foie gras I passed on the pure foie torchon and opted for this - a tough choice on one hand, but at the same time perhaps a good call as this terrine was outstanding and enjoyable to the both of us.  According to Erik also sporting some foie intermingled with rough cut and pressed roast duck plus chunks of funky chevre this terrine was at once smooth and meaty, peppery but balanced, and entirely spreadable on the lightly charred bread.  Hefty to be sure but nicely tempered by the sweetness of the apricot spread and served in ample portion this is definitely a dish to share.
