Art Institute of Chicago////I wasn't that excited to visit the Art Institute on my weekend trip to Chicago, but I have to say it was my favourite visit out of our entire 5-attraction City Pass. Oddly enough, I think my favourite part was the Miniature Room exhibit. I didn't think I would care about it so much, but they were just so cool! Such craftsmanship for such teeny tiny pieces-- I was in awe. I took a photo with my phone against the glass and everyone I sent it to was tricked into thinking it was a real, full-size room! We spent hours here, and probably would have stayed longer if we didn't have to catch a flight home. Obviously there are also numerous famous works here worth seeing. A must-visit museum, for tourists and locals, in my opinion.
