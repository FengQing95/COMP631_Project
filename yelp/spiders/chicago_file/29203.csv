Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Iconic. Best Chicago-style pizza. But my favorite thing is their thin crust! It is so underrated. They only use the best, fresh, and high-quality ingredients. You can taste the difference. It's a great result. Their wings are also very good. I was a bit surprised. Overall, it's just a great experience. Always friendly staff. Super awesome
