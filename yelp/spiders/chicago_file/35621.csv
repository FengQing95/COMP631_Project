Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We were promptly seated for our late evening reservation. Unfortunately we sat for 20 minutes without service even though the tables around us were well taken care of. The room was roughly 2/3rds full and there did not seem to be a lack of staff. We elected to leave and informed the host stand of the reason for our departure. I wish I could say this was an isolated incident here but the service on a previous visit felt lacking as as well and recent experiences at adjacent Gilt Bar have similarly disappointed. Given the rapidly expanding options in the city it's become difficult to justify return visits even though we love the food.
