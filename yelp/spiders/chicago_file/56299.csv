Smoque BBQ////The baby back ribs rivaled ribs I've had anywhere else, but the real star for me were the St. Louis ribs.  They were meatier and juicier than their baby back equivalents and with extra barbeque sauce they were to die for.  The brisket was excellent as well, fall apart tender with great smoke and beef flavor.  I was also a big fan of the vinegary sauce that came along with the brisket.  As for the sides, I enjoyed the mac and cheese which was cheesy, creamy and everything a good mac and cheese should be.  However, the side I enjoyed the most was the peach cobbler.
