Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were so incredibly excited to have deep dish and definitely picked the right place! We got there early, around 11 am to beat the crowd. People started piling in around noon and by the time we left around 1 it was swamped so get there early if you don't want to wait. But really, their pizza is worth the wait. We are coming back to Chicago this week and debated trying Gino's but thought, why get something else when we know Lou Malnati's was so good!!! We also had wings that were great. Wings are often something that places either do really well or really poorly and Lou Malnati's has great wings for a pizza joint.
