Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////And I'm glad we stayed! We pre-ordered our pizza (I think just something to make us feel better as I don't think it made a bit of difference), took our plastic blinking thingy and headed to the bar where we had a delicious $8 Gold Coast Old Fashioned. Super friendly bar staff.
