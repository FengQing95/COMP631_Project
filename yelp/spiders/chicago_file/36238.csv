Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////-Forget the weekends- just come on a weeknight! Just as lively and busy as this is a popular steak restaurant and it'll just be easier to get reservations. Also, just come in for a huge sharable salad and order a delicious cocktail or a bottle of wine and relax. The comforting restaurant is featured with hints of vintage and a romantic ambiance. I love the cozyness style of elegance. As fine dining as it is, the waiters/waitresses are not in uniform and they are friendly and personable while holding a professional demeanor.
