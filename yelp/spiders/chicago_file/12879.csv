Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Being a visitor to the Windy City, I had to try the infamous deep dish pizza! This place was recommended to us & based on the reviews, we decided to have lunch here. On a Thursday afternoon at 3pm, we were seated immediately. It takes 30-40 minutes for your pizza to come out, so we ordered ASAP upon sitting down. The 3 of us split a medium Chicago classic (sausage & tomatoes) & added mushrooms ($20 all together). When the mega pie appeared, our eyes lit up & we were ready to dog in after the long wait (it really built up some anticipation!). After my first bite, I wasn't sure how I felt about it. The crust was buttery & perfectly crunchy underneath all that pizza. There was a really thick layer of cheese, which was awesome, & a thick layer of sausage, topped off with slightly sweet chunky tomato sauce & mushrooms. After more & more bites, it really grew on me & by the end I really enjoyed it & was ready for my second slice! However, the pizza was so filling none of us could finish our second slices. So unless you have the option of taking home leftovers, order modestly because this pizza is heaver than your typical pizza! All in all, I think it was a great introduction to my deep dish pizza weekend. Affordable, tasty, & filling!
