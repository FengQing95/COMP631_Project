Art Institute of Chicago////Easily four stars. Not sure how to post half a star yet to make it four and a half but this place is really, really good and well-executed. The restaurant in the Modern Wing leaves a lot to be desired but this one off the courtyard in the center of the Art Institute is excellent from greeting to service to food to returning to the galleries. Highly recommended!
