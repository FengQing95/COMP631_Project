Art Institute of Chicago////Art engages me, and it inspires many ideas and really verse in me, but rarely do I feel like I have found a companion, a piece that I think I could add to. Because art is not a monologue, like literature- art demands the readers time and elicits a response, visual arts pleads to be understood. On my walls, I have five pieces of original artwork ( not counting my daughter's work that is everywhere). As I wrote that number I had to keep deleting, as another piece I bought came to mind. Below is one of two, I bought last year. The medium is a back to an old choir chair from my church. It's called "Cloud keepers." It's above me as I write this. Its sister is in the other window sill. And next to me is a charcoal drawing of a cat and a print of a cacti in the style of the Roycrofters hangs to my left. I just bought another print, that's in the hall, I am still trying to place it.
