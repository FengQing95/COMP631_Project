Smoque BBQ////My cousin turned me onto these guys. His wife was from Texas where there's some of the best BBQ you can get anyways her opinion was that is the best bbq outside of Texas. So I tried it and it's fantastic. They've got great food with some killer sides needless to say they immediately got put in my rotation of places we go. I usually go with the brisket But there's chicken as well as ribs among their main items
