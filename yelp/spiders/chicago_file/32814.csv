Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I really wish I could give it more Â stars. My favorite steakhouse anywhere. It begins with the speakeasy vibe when you walk in and continues with the 1920's style music... Finally the food is as good as it gets. I had the bone in ribeye and it was outstanding. All the sides were amazing as well. Love this place !
