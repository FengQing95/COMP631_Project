Smoque BBQ////First time at Smoque for lunch was a great experience. What a gem for some great BBQ! The smoke flavor and ring on the ribs was perfect, no sauce was even needed. The pulled pork sandwich was very meaty and the flavor was outstanding. The pulled pork plate was hearty and all our sides of slaw, bbq beans, and fries were so so good! Parking can be tough along the street, but it's worth it! Will definitely be going back when back in the city.
