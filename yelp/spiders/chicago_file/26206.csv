Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Last night while in Chicago on business I decided to go on an excursion (all by my lonesome - after hiding from the typical colleague steakhouse dinner) into the inner city in search of authentic Chicago style deep dish pizza. Initially I thought I might head out to the place that was featured on Anthony Bordain's "No Reservations", but once I realized it was about 40 minutes outside of the city I quickly changed my mind. I settled on the Lou Malnati's pizzeria. They have several locations, however this location seemed to be the most popular and it also happened to be in a part of town with interesting bars and lounges within a few blocks (check my other reviews for some good recommendations).
