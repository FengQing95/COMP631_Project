Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is easily my favorite restaurant in Chicago!!  I've been to Iberico and others, and although this may not be the most 100% authentic of them all, it has the atmosphere and food to blow the others out of the water!  Expect to wait at least an hour, but always knock about 30 mins off of the time they tell you..there has never been a time that they say it will be a 2 hour wait and it ends up only being 90 mins!  It's well worth the wait, the bar is awesome with to-die-for sangria!
