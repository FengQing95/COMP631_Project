Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ok, I chose this place because of all the yelp reviews but I don't get why it's so highly rated. The pizza was ok but not 4 or 5 stars good. I went here twice on a recent trip to Chicago. The first time I got the classic with sausage tomatoes and the butter crust. I was super underwhelmed. The crust had hardly any flavor. The sauce and the sausage were flavorful but overall I just thought it was kinda boring and not at all exceptional.
