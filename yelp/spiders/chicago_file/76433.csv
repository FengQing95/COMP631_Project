Little Goat Diner////Beautiful cozy place with great service! Food flavors are different, you can get a combination of sour and salty in one meal. They serve a local roasted coffee Dark Matter, so good coffee as well. Our friendly server Carl was very helpful explaining all the ingredients that we couldn't understand. Â You'll have a great experience at this diner.
