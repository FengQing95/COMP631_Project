Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As we left we asked for the manager again. She offered many apologies and this time gave her personal email as we made complaints. I would really like to have had great things to say about this place because it is so nice inside but real is real and fair is fair. The downstairs was really nice and cozy for couples and I was surprised by the old school hip hop they played that would have gotten them a 5 stars. But instead..... maybe it was just one of those nights.
