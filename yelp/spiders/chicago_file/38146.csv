Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////But the service! The service! Barbara, our server, was professional, friendly but not over-friendly, attentive and empathetic. Their tiny firework add-on for the birthday was the right amount of celebratory touch. Then, we encountered a mini-crisis, which can really test the level of customer service. The swift coordination between Barbara and Pim, the manager on site, and the way it was handled amazed this picky and demanding customer. No wonder it is packed on a cold Monday night.
