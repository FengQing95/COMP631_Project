Smoque BBQ////I just visited this place last weekend with a few friends on a Saturday night.  We ordered the pulled pork, baby back ribs and brisket.  The brisket and baby back ribs were the best.  They gave you more than enough bbq sauce to enjoy your meal.  The place do gets pretty pack on weekend.  Definitely one of the best bbq joint in the city.  Could use more space to sit though
