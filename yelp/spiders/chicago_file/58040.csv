Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I'm such a huge fan of Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!! I made a lunchtime reservation a few days in advance. The restaurant seems small from outside, but it actually extends super far into the back. I loved the natural lighting in the main dining room! My waitress was super sweet - I wish I had gotten her name. She offered great recommendations and checked up on me a few times. I got handed a huge basket of delicious warm sourdough bread and couldn't stop eating it haha
