Little Goat Diner////Off the bat, I noticed the Asian inspiration in several of the dishes which I thought was unique and fun for a diner. To start, we ordered the fried pickles which were out of this world. They were fried almost like tempura style and were actually quite light. I ordered the Banh Mi style burger for my main course, and opted for the goat burger and a fried egg on top. It was absolutely excellent. I especially loved the addition of mint. It offered such a unique flavor which isn't typical for a burger. I would absolutely visit Little Goat Diner again. Hopefully next time they aren't out of the cinnamon buns :)
