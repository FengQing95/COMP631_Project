Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My husband and I like Pizza Uno better, because we like their crust better for the sweetness and gooeyness.  It's a matter of preference.  The good thing with Lou's is that there many locations so the wait is not as excruciating when you're really hungry.  It's also a lot brighter and not as intimate as Pizza Uno...so it's probably better for small groups and casual eating.
