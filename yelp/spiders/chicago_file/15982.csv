Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Saw Lou on Bobby Flay's Throwdown (Lou won) and decided to try it.  We got a pizza from a number of different famous Chicago pizzerias, all deep dish.  My favorite was Lou Malnati's.  Their crust is just phenomenal and I liked that the pizza wasn't so thick and gooey that I was gagging from cheese overload.  It really was the best deep dish I've had in Chicago.
