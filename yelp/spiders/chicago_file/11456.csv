Art Institute of Chicago////I have always loved this place growing up. My boyfriend and I recently came back and WOW I forgot how huge this place is. Granted we were in time crunch but, there's so much to see. Classics, modern, contemporary, this place has it all! We will have to come back when we have the whole day to kill but, if you love art or you're out of town..please stop in!
