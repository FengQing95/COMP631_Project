Little Goat Diner////We were back in town so decided to check out one of our favorites of our old neighborhood. I ordered the pork belly pancake and brussel sprouts and the hubby ordered the skirt steak...and we were so pleased with our food that we ordered the apple pie and mac and cheese to go for late night cravings in our hotel room. Ambiance - awesome, food - extremely memorable, service - a little slow but friendly. Left as happy campers and thankful that Stephanie and her team are keeping up the quality even 5 years after opening.
