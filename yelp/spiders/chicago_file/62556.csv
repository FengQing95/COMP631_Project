Smoque BBQ////Wow what a meal! I usually don't like eating a lot of meat mostly because I've had experiences where the meat is really chewy. Despite my awful experiences, I decided to give this place a try. I got the sliced brisket sandwich which was fantastic so tender just melted in your mouth. The bun they used was simple not too dry or moist just perfect. The fries had a good crisp to it no oily or soggy fries! The BBQ beans were a good side to have. They have excellent customer service surprised to have two different ppl check up on us. They even suggested the spicy BBQ sauce and sweet jalape√±os which they have generous samples of. After that amazing feast we had their peach cobbler pie which was an explosion of juicy flavor with a piece of granola crunch just perfect! Loved it! Great experience! I would suggest they improve their coleslaw and add mashed potatoes to their sides!
