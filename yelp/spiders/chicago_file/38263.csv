Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////So good and classicly classic! If that makes sense. Upstairs big booths , dark, great bar and amazing food (steak house food) this isn't fu fu food. The downstairs bar is where I prefer to eat. Super dark, music, loud talk feels really oldschool. Will not leave here disappointed unless u are 1. Cheap 2. On a romantic date 3. Looking for little shitty dishes or 4 . You are a PU@@Y
