Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I would rate this 10 stars if I could!   Hands down the best restaurant in the city of Chicago.  The bacon on the roasted tomato salad is to die for.   The filet mignon is cooked to perfection and never disappoints.  Goes great with the corn and fries.  Dont shy away from the Martinis either.  Very potent.  Staff is extremely friendly and knowledgable.   The downstairs is much more of an intimate experience and cool vibe.   If you have never gone to Bavettes you are missing out.  Only con is getting reservations on the weekend...its always packed.
