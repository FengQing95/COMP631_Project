The Purple Pig////I was staying across the street and decided to pop in for dinner with a few coworkers, not realizing how popular this place is. We were able to get seated in the back, at a bar-top overlooking the kitchen/prep area, which ended up being pretty cool because we got to see just about everything on the menu. The bone marrow is a pretty popular choice here, however we opted for the pork belly, "pizza" and ribs. Everything was great, despite service being a little slow. Highly recommend!
