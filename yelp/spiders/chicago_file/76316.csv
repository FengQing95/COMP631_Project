Little Goat Diner////Service is excellent, although it did take a little bit for the waiter to notice me at the bar. He had other tables, but once he is there, he is sure you get your food as quickly as they can. Also, the host/ hostess doesn't always provide a drink / cocktail menu so make sure you ask for it!
