Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The service is similarly wonderful; every hostess/waiter/waitress/busser that I have spoken to (keep in mind, I frequent this place monthly) was very pleasant and had a smile ready--even in the worst of the dinner rushes. I have even been offered free desserts a couple times because the staff recognizes me from previous outings, and wanted to "pay me back" for my patronage. How cool are these guys?!
