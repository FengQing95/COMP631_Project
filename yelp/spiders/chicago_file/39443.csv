Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////If you don't order the mashed potatoes, you're doing it wrong. The steaks are absolutely delicious, but the mashed potatoes are HEAVENLY. My husband insisted on trying their lemon meringue pie and we were surprised by the height of the meringue. You really can't go wrong with anything at Bavette's!
