The Purple Pig////The interior is decorated nicely. The space is a good size-doesn't feel overcrowded. Didn't love the overall aesthetic-some of the decor doesn't go well with each other, but regardless if the food was great it is easily something that could be looked past. With that said, the food was TERRIBLE and the service was below average. To start, we ordered the pig feet, Brussels sprouts, lamb, and the octopus. The pig feet were extremely salty, to the point where I felt I needed to chug my entire water glass. I could not finish it. The Brussels sprouts were good. The lamb was not good at all with chunks of cartilage that my boyfriend literally was spitting out at points. The octopus was too chewy and the sauce was not tasty.
