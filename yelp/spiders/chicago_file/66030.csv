Smoque BBQ////I've been going to smoke for years. Every single meal there has been consistent fresh heart and delicious. They're always extremely busy but the people that work there are always very good with handling the crowd. They always keep everybody calm and there happens to be a long wait which is well worth it. Are usually get the brisket pulled pork or the ribs. They are all equally delicious. Their mac & cheese side is awesome as is the peach cobbler. They give you a nice choice of sauces on the side and they are not chin see what their french fries. When you get an order to go it is packed very well hot and is always right with no mistakes. They have a very good system now especially with pick up they have people waiting outside you give them your order number just pull up in a marked off area and they will bring your food right out to you. One of the best barbecue places around. You have to go in and try the food especially if you love barbecue. I can go through the menu item by item but it won't do it justice you have to go in and experience it yourself you won't be disappointed go in there and enjoy or bring it home and enjoy thank you for reading.
