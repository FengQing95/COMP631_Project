Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////You're either partial to Lou Malnati's or the other G pizza. I'm more than partial to Lou. Great pizza and great place. Can get very crowded with a bit of a wait, so come with patience. The good thing is, you can pre-order while you wait for your table. We waited at most 40 minutes but got our pizza very quickly once seated.
