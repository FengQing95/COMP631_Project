Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The best Chicago deep dish pizza. Yes it takes a while to get the food since it is deep dish. We decided to order the bruschetta while we waited. OMG best bruschetta I have ever had it was yummy. The beer was really good too a change from what I'm used to but so good. Wish they had that in cali. Which they had this pizza and bruschetta in Cali. Everything was amazing. The service was great. They even brought be desert since it was my birthday. Can't wait to go back this place is beautiful on the inside really has an older restaurant vibe.
