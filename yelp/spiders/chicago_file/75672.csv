Little Goat Diner////giver them it a 2nd chance.  My husband said he wasn't feeling well and barely ate anything.  It turned out he didn't want to disappoint me because I was so excited about the restaurant. His pork sandwich was so thin it seemed be more breading than pork & a bit overcooked. He took it home because he couldn't really eat it all and it was horrible reheated even w/ some steam to keep it from drying out further.  We'll give it a 2nd chance. The staff is fantastic.
