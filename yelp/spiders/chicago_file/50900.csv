Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tapas galore! Café Ba-Ba-Reeba is as fun as the name sounds; with its festive Spanish décor, flamenco music, and flavorful foods. I went here for a much needed girls' night the other weekend and it was a great experience. We got a pitcher of red sangria (naturally) and thoroughly enjoyed it. I also tried a taster of the pear sangria which would be perfect as a refreshing summer drink.
