Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I usually get a petite filet but he said their bone in filet was his favorite and he preferred it over the bone in rib eye which was the direction my boyfriend was headed until he told us the bone in  filet was out of this world, he wasn't wrong. This was the best steak I have ever had. Perfectly cooked to my medium rare plus request. I had the roasted garlic on mine and the BF had the bone marrow on his, we were both in steak heaven w/ our orders. There is also a fab fancy salt and pepper mix they bring to the table. I thought the addition of the pinch of that, put it over the top, I ate the whole thing and it was probably almost twice as big as the petite I usually get when I go to a steak joint! I felt glutinous but loved every bite. We had the truffle Mac as a side, very good but I left that mostly to my BF as I was too into my meat. John meanwhile, was spot on w/ the wine pairings for our steak and gave us a mini wine tasting so we would have the absolute perfect match with our steak, and this place was buzzin, he never made us feel like he was rushed or too busy and he was slammed but handled it all so well. I only say this  because I work in the service industry and take notice of things like that, he really is a natural at what he does and what he does is make you feel like you are the only guests in an extremely busy restaurant! Way to go John!!  I saw so many more things on that menu I need to try and I just so happen to have moved across the block from Bavettes, they're going to get sick of me!
