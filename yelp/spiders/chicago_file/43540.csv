Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago...and to be honest  I am not the sharing type. I have been here 30+ times and I love the  fluttering yuppie vibe, the outdoor patio (in the summer) and I especially appreciate the food. My menu favorites include the patatas brava with alioli sauce,  the stuffed mushroom caps and the baked goat cheese. I am a vegetarian, so this is about all I can eat from the menu... yet I dream of these potatoes. I have, on occasion, even ordered an extra carry out of potatoes before leaving!
