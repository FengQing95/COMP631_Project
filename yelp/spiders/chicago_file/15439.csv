Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As a new Chicagoean, I can't say I know where you can get the "BEST" deep dish--but I must say this was pretty damn good. We ordered The Lou (spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes + mozaarella, romano, & cheddar cheese), and it was DEE-LISH-USHHHH. The crust was crisp and buttery (probably why it was so damn good), and the toppings fill your mouth in a cheesy, scrumptious mess. It's not overwhelming like some of the deep dish I've had in the past. I only have Gino's East to compare this to---and I liked Lou Malnati's WAY better! =P''
