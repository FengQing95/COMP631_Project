Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute is an encyclopedic museum and it holds many iconic works.  If you don't know where they are, just follow the cell phone trail where you'll find folks taking selfies in front of their favorite Van Gogh or that famous rural couple in 'American Gothic'.  Like any great art museum, this place gets packed.  If you want some alone time with your favorite paintings, map out your route and get here when the doors open.
