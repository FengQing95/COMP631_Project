Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////If you want to have the best bone-in ribeye in the city, come here!! I've tried almost every fancy steakhouse throughout Chicago and I keep coming back to Bavettes. The atmosphere and cocktails are super great too. It gets really busy so if you don't like to wait you'll definitely need a reservation. However, if don't mind waiting you can put your name in when you arrive and sip on a nice cocktail (they make the best dirty martinis) while hanging out in upscale loungey area and have an app or two!
