Art Institute of Chicago////This place Never disappoints. I love every inch of it.  I am a HUGE art fan.  The scope, the diversity, the quality, the simplicity of raw expression through particular and carefully chosen media is what I live for and that with which I make my living.  There is nothing to me like exploring this amazing, first rate collection of some of the worlds finest treasures.  What is most notable about this place is the inability to truly describe the art you see.  These are items you MUST see and sense to truly behold.
