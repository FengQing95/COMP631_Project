Little Goat Diner////Absolutely horrible. My chicken was undercooked. A manager and waiter insisted that it's just the way it's served. Both manager and waiter opted to give me a lesson in their way of preparation.. I'm leaving the restaurant with flames coming from my ears. I'm hungry and disgusted.
