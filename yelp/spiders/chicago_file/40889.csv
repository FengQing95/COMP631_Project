Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is loud, crowded and fun. The tapas are delicious (don't pass up the bacon wrapped dates) and the drinks are great (especially the sangria). The waitstaff is helpful and entertaining. I really enjoyed my night out here. The only negative was the long wait for the food, but that can be forgiven.
