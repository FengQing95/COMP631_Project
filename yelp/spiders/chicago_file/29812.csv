Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Finally!  I've been to a number of Chicago pizza places and Lou's is the first one that I will definitely be going back too!  We got there when there was a rush so we put our order in and headed down the street for some bevys. A short while later see got the text and headed back. The 'za was delicious and most importantly HOT!  I have no problem waiting for food as long as it's done well and this was. You should give it a try!
