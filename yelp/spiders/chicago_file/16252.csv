Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////He figured it out when I could not place my finger on it.  The crust was not fully cooked.  It was actually more yellow than a toasty brown.  It was Lou's special, and I regret not ordering plain pepperoni.  I will say that I could certainly taste the fresh mozzarella.  It's just that I also tasted a lot of "yeasty/doughy" which wasn't appealing.
