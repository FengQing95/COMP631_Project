The Purple Pig////This is my very Hubble opinion, but I'm very torn. I love the food, but miss the atmosphere of the old place. However, The quality of Chef Bannos's menu has not waivered. I miss the communal and intimate feel of the old place. I enjoyed sharing a table with other patrons and having good conversations and I miss how cozy it was. That being said, I completely understand the need for progress and expansion to fill the demand for his food, and with COVID that definitely wouldn't be happening. The atmosphere now feels just like an everyday eatery. I'm happy to say that quality and flavor has not been sacrificed.
