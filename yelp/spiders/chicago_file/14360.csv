Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Sat down in what I thought was the bar area, but apparently you have to wait for a table there too.  Waiter was nice - energetic and helpful.  We placed an order for the cheesy bread appetizer, which took a lot longer to get to us than I thought it would - but it was fairly busy so we understood. Waiter forgot my drink for like 15 minutes, but ended up bringing my date a free beer, which was nice.   Pizza was good, nothing to write home about, but good.
