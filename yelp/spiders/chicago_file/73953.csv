Little Goat Diner////After dinner, we went upstairs to check out their rooftop since I read about it in one of those billion Chicago blog articles about the "best rooftop bars in the city".  It was decent but definitely didn't wow me.  The bartender was courteous enough but not that friendly towards us.  It's also pretty dark up there and I wish they had a little more lighting so you could see who you were talking to.  Overall, it's a nice rooftop bar but I think I'll be checking others out first.  Little Goat lived up to its name and I will be back!
