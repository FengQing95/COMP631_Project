Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Something wasn't mashing with my tastebuds. I ordered the Malnati's Classic (not pictured). Bread crust was soggy and the tomato/marinara sauce was bland. I did like the extra mozzarella cheese embedded in the pizza. I'm glad I ordered a personal size because I would have hated to trash the whole thing.
