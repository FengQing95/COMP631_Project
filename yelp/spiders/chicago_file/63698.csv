Smoque BBQ////Every time I drive by Smoque the line is out of this world. Yesterday driving to another restaurant my husband pointed out there was no line, and just like that we finally made it happen! The food is as delicious as other reviewer have said, and the best part was the price! They have very reasonable prices and large portions. I had the half rack or ribs with fries and mac and cheese, and my husband had the brisket. Everything was delicious. I wouldn't wait in line though, because I've been to other places in the city that I find equally good or better (tone honest). If you're in the neighborhood and you're lucky enough to get in without a wait...go for it!
