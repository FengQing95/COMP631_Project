Little Goat Diner////In Short: Great food, semi-affordable prices (good for the West Loop), cool ambience, great for young people (very few middle aged-old people here), good for mid sized groups (3-5), menu has nice variety, innovative and creative takes on classics, easy to get into (although i usually try to make a reservation if its the weekend).
