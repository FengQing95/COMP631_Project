Little Goat Diner////Stopped here for a semi-quick bite before going to the Blackhawks game.  Very lively and Modern environment. There was about a 30 minute wait, but because we were a party of two we were offered immediate seating at the countertop.  I was drooling over the possibility of ordering their chicken pot pie, however time was a factor, so we opted for quicker items. Their nachos were delicious! Pulled pork, pickled peppers, cheese, cream fraiche, and homemade massa corn chips were a divine combination.  We could have skipped the entrées all together because this appetizer was large and hearty.  Nonetheless, I truly enjoyed the chickpea salad (it was a different take on a falafel salad).  The falafel was not dense and dry as traditional falafel would be. Inside the falafel was a mix of broccoli, cauliflower, and other vegetables.  It was served over a mild kale, pickled onions, and included a very flavorful whipped Tzatziki.  My husband ordered the beef stroganoff. He did not enjoy it, because it wasn't as rich and creamy as he would prefer. He also did not like the taste of the meat. I, on the other hand, did like the taste.  It was more of a wine reduction base and I liked that it wasn't heavy.  Overall, we had a great time  and enjoyed attentive service and delicious food!
