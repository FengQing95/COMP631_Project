Smoque BBQ////Great Pulled Pork.  Love the mustard sauce.  The wedge is always a starter for the meal.  Like this place a lot.  Best BBQ in the city???  I would say always a consistently good meal.  Owner is really nice and always checking on your happiness. Staff is friendly and attentive.  Beef ribs tender and rank with other Q places in the city.   I always leave happy.
