Smoque BBQ////So you've heard the hype about Smoque and you're deciding whether or not it's worth the line. Let me help you out...you should already be standing in line deciding what yumminess you'll be partaking in. Are you there yet? Hurry up, you'll likely have a while to wait once you arrive if you're planning on eating there. On the other hand, if you're not there yet, stop and pick up a 6 pack to enjoy with your meal. This spot is BYOB (if you're eating inside)!
