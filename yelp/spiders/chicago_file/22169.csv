Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The seating area and location here are phenomenal. The staff is adequate, nothing note worthy. In regards to pizza, Lou malnatis has a very distinct taste unlike any other restaurant. I feel like you're either going to really like it or really hate it. For me, I'd say I'm more on the hate side. I just find it a tad too greasy, and I'm just not a fan of the taste that much. I also think there's not much of a balance between cheese and sauce. They put a ton of tomato sauce and very little cheese. I'm much more of a giordanos person, the pizza there is phenomenal.
