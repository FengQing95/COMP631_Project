Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Try this place the food is all the craze, all the spices and deliciously marinated chicken, steak, shrimp, escargot and so on will leave you wanting more! Make sure you grab a glass of wine with that as well, it might be tough to choose however since most of their wine complements food uniquely but in abundance and choices aren't narrow!
