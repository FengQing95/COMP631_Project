The Purple Pig////Made a last minute decision to come here.  I called and they said there was no wait.  I took a lyft here and a couple inside said they enjoyed their meal there 2 days ago.  I asked the waiter which meal was popular and he said the octopus.  I tried that and it was awesome.  I then asked for an appetizer recommendation and he recommended the ribeye meat with a funky cheese.  That combo was off the hook!  Best combo delicious meal I've had.  It was the perfect marriage of flavors accompanied by sweet pickles and jelly.  The flavor of stars aligned s wow.  I will be back there before I head home.
