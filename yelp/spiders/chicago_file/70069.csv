Little Goat Diner////The kitchen was bustling, of course with Stephanie right alongside everyone back there, flipping pancakes. Our waitress was a doll.  There were children EVERYWHERE.  Which I was surprised at, but upon further paying attention, it seems that was expected.  They had their own goat coloring activities and goat sippy cups for their drinks.
