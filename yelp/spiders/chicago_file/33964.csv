Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Went to Bavettes because I plan on trying every major steakhouse in Chicago, and it was Bavettes turn on the list.  The sat us at a cramped little table on what felt like a runway, so obviously I asked to be moved, they were very accommodating, and moved us to a booth in the lower level which I know sounds a bit sketchy, but it was honestly the best decision I made.  The service was phenomenal and the food was great as well.  The waiter didn't interrupt our meal once, but made sure we were taken care of.  I would definitely return to Bavettes
