Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////For the main entree we ordered chicken and veggie paella which was 'okay' , it could be better , specially being their 'specialty'. Lastly, our dessert, I ordered caramelized banana with ice cream it was good and light, I can def see eating this again in the future. And the bf ordered chocolate truffled cake it was rich in flavor, it was good but I'm not really into that for my dessert specially eating a lot of food. and then his friend ordered apple empanadas , I didn't try it but his friend said it was good!
