Art Institute of Chicago////One of the best museums I've ever been to!  They have all the greats here!  It is awesome (in the true sense of the word) to turn a corner and come face to face with paintings you've only seen in school books and in movies.  Just amazing!  Brings a tear to my eye every time just being in the presence of so much talent and history.
