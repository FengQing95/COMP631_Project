Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I also tried the fried chicken (moist, but the batter could use some tweaking as it basically burned), the beef stroganoff (very flavorful, generous helpings of braised beef), the corn elotes (a must get), and of course the Golden Sundae (with a 'magic shell' chocolate coating and whiskey gelato courtesy of Black Dog).
