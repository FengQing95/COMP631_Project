The Purple Pig////Came here on a friend's recommendation. We stopped by between 3-4pm on a Monday and didn't have to make reservations or wait for a table. Since it was a rather random time to eat, we just ordered a few items: pork belly, chicken kebabs, fried manchego, and pig ears. The star of the dishes was probably the pork belly since the taste was a little more complex, but the chicken kebabs is a good and safe runner up. While I'd come here again to try other items on the menu, I would not recommend the other two dishes.
