Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I have made it my personal goal to try every steak house in Chicago. The dry aged bone in rib eye is possibly the best steak I have ever had. I set up a reservation as I was leaving the food was so good. The only bad thing is it's three month wait to get a reservation on a Saturday.
