Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The boyfriend and I were visiting from out of town, and after some researching, decided to try out the lou Malnati's deep dish pizza. I hate waiting in lines, and the restaurant doesn't take any reservations, although you can order online ahead if time, so we actually came just right after it opened, at 10:40am. The restaurant was empty and we are quickly seated. We can were told that the pizza takes 45 minutes to cook, so we started with a salad, which was surprisingly tasty (I guess that's what happens when you put bacon into anything). We did indeed end up waiting 45mins for our pizza and ate at 1139, so despite coming super early, ate at a decent brunch time. We had a small (more than enough for two people as long as you're not famished) and they kindly did half "the lou" and half classic". The pizza itself was ok- it seems like they are known for their buttery crust, which it was, although I found it a little hard. The flavors were okay. I've never had a deep dish pizza so I don't have anything to compare it to, but it wasn't terribly memorable.
