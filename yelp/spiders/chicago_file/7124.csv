Art Institute of Chicago////An impressive exhibit of over 160 works including paintings and sculpture.  The works span a range of artistic periods and also includes some rarely seen works.  Lichtenstein's style is easily accessible to young and old, ranging from comic panels to reinterpretations of other artworks such as Picasso, Monet and Matisse.  This is an awesome collection!
