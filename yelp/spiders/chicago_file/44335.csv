Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I haven't seen my buddies from college in 5 years so when I finally got back to Chicago, we decided to eat here.  Unfortunately we didn't make reservations so we arrived around 7pm and waited 2 hours.  But, there was a Cubs game on tv, and we kept ourselves busy drinking about 5 pitchers of sangria.
