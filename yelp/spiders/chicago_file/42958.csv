Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Usually my wife and I get about 6 different plates depending on the size of each. My favorite so far are the sweet potatoes which are AMAZING!!!  They usually come in a big order and are cut like fries but don't have the dryness or texture of fries. Instead they are kind of gooey and extremely delicious.  They also come with a dipping sauce that is unlike anything I have ever tasted, but still extremely good.  My other favorite there is the beef tenderloin plate. It is cooked perfectly and topped with blue cheese. Definitely try the sangria while you are there too, you won't be disappointed.
