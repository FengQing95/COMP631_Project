Smoque BBQ////All in all I am having a difficult time rating Smoque.  It is definitely a "thing" and overrated by barbecue starved Chicagoans, but that does not make it bad.  Ms T would not return while I would, but hopefully on a night with no significant wait.  I would try ribs again and see if over cooking is systematic.  I would order chopped brisket as a platter.  I don't know what sides I would get.  It breaks my heart to not be able to get onion free slaw.  OK, I made up my mind, the slaw tipped the balance to three stars.  I really would go 3-1/2 if I could.
