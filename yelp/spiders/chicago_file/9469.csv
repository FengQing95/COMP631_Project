Art Institute of Chicago////Magic. We lived in Chicago for a few years and one of our best decisions was to become members. Go for an afternoon, go for an hour, take a 15 minute break to see a painting or two; you won't be disappointed. Stunning art in a truly beautiful architectural feat. This museum is one of my favorites in all the world. Stop by the downstairs cafeteria for a great lite meal (if you're a member, head to the member lounge and have a glass of wine or two) or head to one of the many surrounding restaurants for a true dining experience! A great reprieve from the winter. I can't wait to go back the next time we visit Chicago.
