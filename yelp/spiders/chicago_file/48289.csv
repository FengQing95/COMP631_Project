Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The staff was very accommodating. We didn't have a reservation and there was a two hour wait but the hostess told us about their full service bar area and we were able to find a table. Cafe Ba-ba-reeba is cute. It looks small from the outside but much bigger once you go inside. There is an outside area that's covered. Food is tapas style. So we started with spicy potatoes with alioli, goat cheese baked in tomato sauce with bread, grilled hanger steak with charred green chili chimichurri & fingerling potatoes, shrimp with garlic, olive oil and red pepper flakes (least fav), buttermilk fried chicken thighs, piri-piri sauce and shaved vegetable salad (my fav). We also ordered the chicken paella which takes 40 minutes to cook and it was so good! Usually places only have seafood paella or paella with pork...they have those plus vegetarian or chicken so I had to try it! Cafe ba-ba-reeba is located in Lincoln Park. Overall an enjoyable experience. I will go there for Spanish food any day!
