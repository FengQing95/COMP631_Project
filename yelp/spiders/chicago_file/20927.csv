Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I had my Lou's delivered and it was fast and fresh. We got a large deep dish and we where able to eat off of it for 2 days. It reheats great. The crust along the top was crispy and there was plenty of cheese. The flavors are amazing. We just had pepperoni but it tasted like the world was on it. You must go and experience for yourself.
