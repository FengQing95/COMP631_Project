Little Goat Diner////First, the sandwiches are HUGE. Like, bigger than my face huge, and served a la carte - not that you would need any more food with it. I'd recommend sharing a sandwich and ordering The Fattoush salad to share, so you can try more things. The Pork Torta and Sloppy Goat were both so generously piled with meat and toppings - and equally delicious and satisfying.
