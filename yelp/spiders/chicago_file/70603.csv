Little Goat Diner////I'm not sure if I picked the wrong dishes but still, it was pretty mediocre and would not go back. Springy shrimp and pork belly was way too salty and the sauce the waitress spoke highly of was unimpressive. Friend got a bbq pork sandwich and it didn't have much taste and was just ok.
