Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Why the econ 101? Because this past weekend, I waited for a table at Wildberry Cafe for 45 minutes. My normal weekend brunches usually last 45 minutes. Now, there are things (foods in particular) that I will happily wait in line for - most of them in SF (hello Bi-Rite Creamery, Tartine & Hog Island!). Or, even in the city, I could be found in line at Hot Doug's, or m henry, and especially Victory's Banner. The general rule of thumb: I wait for things that are exceptional.
