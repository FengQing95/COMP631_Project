Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////One minor, but really classy touch was while we were seated in a waiting area for one more guest a waiter came over and poured two glasses of water for us, just like we would have been expected to be treated if we were at our table. The only other place that I have been treated like that is a the 4 star Grace.
