Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Chicago style pizza with their signature sausage topping, extra cheese, and tomato sauce 2/5: The pizza took 40 min to make but was served room temperature. The cheese was solid and not gooey at all. The sausage was very underwhelming considering it is what the restaurant is known for according to the waitress. The tomato sauce has a nice flavour to it but due to the temperature the pizza was served at it was underwhelming
