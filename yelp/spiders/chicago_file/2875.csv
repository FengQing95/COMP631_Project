The Purple Pig////The wait wasn't bad as we thought, but we were seated at the high top sharing table, Â which no one told us we had to specifically request for a regular table. Food was awesome! Loved the half duck, grilled calamari, and pork shoulder! Everything was sooo good! Well definitely come again next we're in Chi-town!
