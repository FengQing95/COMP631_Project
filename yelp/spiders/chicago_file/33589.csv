Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Restaurant lived up to all the buzz.  Arrived with a gluttonous appetite and ordered the bone in filet, bone marrow, bolognese, crab cake, crab legs, side of corn and frittes.  Wow!  Waiter enhanced the wonderful dining experience with his knowledge and recommendations.  Pleasant, welcoming atmosphere that is casual and sophisticated.  I can't wait to return.
