Smoque BBQ////If I ever dine out at a restaurant that has macaroni and cheese on its menu - in any form - I will order it.  It is my all time favorite food, and I am on a constant quest to find the good stuff!!.  Smoque is the real deal.  The perfect amount of cheesiness and creaminess, topped with the tiniest, crisp breadcrumbs that just melt in your mouth.
