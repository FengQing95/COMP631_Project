Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The only hiccup I experienced at Bavette's was the server forgetting to put in some of the sides we ordered. So, our entrees and one side came out with a delay of the other sides. However, the server took full responsibility, apologized, didn't charge for the late sides, and bought us three desserts. He more than compensated for a minor mistake that was not even a huge deal.
