The Purple Pig////The daughter suggested the Purple Pig for dinner. Purple Pig? The name brings to mind the, "Pork. The Other White Meat." advertising slogan from the mid 1980's. It makes me think that things may not have turned out the same with, "Pork. The Other Purple Meat." In advertising, tag lines are important. Just sayin.
