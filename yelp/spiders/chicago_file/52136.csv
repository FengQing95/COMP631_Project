Smoque BBQ////Brisket = so good.  I want to try everything but I don't know if I can get something else now!  I've never had brisket so tender, and the BBQ sauce on the side is incredible.  Need to get extra next time.  The portions and price are also fantastic.  As far as the sides, the mac n cheese which people seem to be raving about here is worth all the attention.  I also had cornbread and cole slaw, neither of which really blew me away, but it was certainly still an excellent meal.
