Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is one of my favorite neighborhood restaurants in Chicago. Red sangria is the BEST I've had, the blue cheese and steak tapas dish and the potatoes are delicious. Frankly everything is so good, it is hard to decide what to order. Get a reservation or you'll be waiting all night.
