Little Goat Diner////An upscale diner with pretty bold food combinations. Definitely fulfilling, different, and something you probably won't find at any regular old diner. I came in for brunch on a Saturday. While we waited to be seated, we went to the Little Goat Bakery and I got The Little Goat coffee (espresso, steamed goat milk, whipped cream, marsala) and the flavors combine in a really unique way-- hot, a kick of spicy, and sweet.
