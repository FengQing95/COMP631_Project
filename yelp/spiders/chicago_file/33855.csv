Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Oh. My. God. This is probably the best steak, wine and service I have ever had in Chicago. My husband and I went for our wedding anniversary and we were not disappointed. From the moment you walk in, it is like a beautiful throw back to 1920s Paris. It's completely adorable and oh so romantic. Our server was not only super helpful in our selections, but very courteous as well. We had the shrimp cocktail and crab cake. All I can say is, if you come to Bavette's, GET THE CRAB CAKE. The best I've ever had. I had the Duchess Filet and my husband the Rib Eye. We ordered mashed potatoes and the elote. Both spectacular. No dessert for us, but 2 bottles of wine did the trick. I can't wait to go back. Bavette's is officially one of my top 5 restaurants in Chicago! XOXO
