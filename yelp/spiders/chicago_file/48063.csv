Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////As for the food, I've had better tapas. We got the Paella Valenciana and the seafood Paella. The verdict was split between the two on which was better but it seemed if you liked seafood you liked the seafood paella. We also got the bacon wrapped dates which I think was the better deal than the Pintxos version where you only get one for $2. The endive, blue cheese, walnut salad was too acidic for my taste and it took awhile for that dish to go away. The other dishes weren't that memorable unfortunately. That's why I give it a 4 out of 5.
