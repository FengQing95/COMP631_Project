Smoque BBQ////We came here on 5-3-14, On a Saturday late in the day. We were running errands & drove past the place and saw the long line outside the door. We actually waited 55 min but the line moved kinda a quick. I was worried that we might not have a place to sit down and eat, the older gentleman found a small place for us 2 cleaned it off for us. I had the Chopped Brisket A-La-Carte w/ 2 Slaw & 2 sides So I asked for French fries & Mac & Cheese. I had to try the cornbread. My sister had the 1/2 slab of ribs w/ slaw & 2 sides Mac & Cheese ,BBQ Baked Beans. We were both stuffed to the gills. It was really good BBQ. Looking for parking is a diamond in the rough, we drove around 2 times then finally find it in the parking lot behind the place. I would visit again. Also try something different.
