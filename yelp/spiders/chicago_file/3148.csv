The Purple Pig////This place was heaven. I was on a business trip on Mother's Day and decided I should treat myself to a nice meal. We went between lunch and dinner - walked right in and sat at the bar. The food was delicious- the cornbread app was everything . I also had the octopus. The service was spectacular and so was the ambiance . I am looking forward to going back to explore more of the menu.
