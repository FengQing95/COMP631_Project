Art Institute of Chicago////We stopped by the Art Institute of Chicago because of many recommendations and it was included on our CityPass.  It is split into two separate buildings, with one being more traditional and one being more modern.  Each building has multiple floors housing a ton of exhibits as you weave your way through all the hallways and corridors.
