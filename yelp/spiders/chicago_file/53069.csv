Smoque BBQ////I don't quite concur with a friend who calls Smoque the best BBQ in Chicago, as I don't think their ribs really even compare to Carson's, but Smoque's Chopped Brisket sandwiches is one of my favorite sandwiches in the city. Accompanied by excellent fries, it makes for a great meal at a good price ($6.95/$8.95 with slaw & one side).
