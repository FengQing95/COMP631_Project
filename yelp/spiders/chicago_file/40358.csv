Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food was incredible at Bavette's! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago.
