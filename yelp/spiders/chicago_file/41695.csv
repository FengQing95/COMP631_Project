Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My girl, BFF and I all went here last night to watch flamenco dancers and have some tapas. I haven't had tapas in a long time so it was good to have them again. We tried sooo many dishes and they were all pretty good. My faves were the chocolate tres leches, shrimp and lobster dip, spinach and cheese stuffed mushrooms and shrimp with red peppers in olive oil. They really liked the chicken empanadas, but I like the way my mom makes them so it wasn't as good to me. There's a lot of hot and cold dishes to choose from. The dancers were really good too. They were pretty entertaining. It was an awesome experience to watch dancers while we dined. We will definitely be returning here!
