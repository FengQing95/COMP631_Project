Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////But the paella was a big letdown. I make my own paella and so was interested to see how it compares and it didn't come close. I use dry white wine and sherry vinegar in my paella as wall as bomba rice. The wine gives it a slightly sweet taste; the bomba rice absorbs all the juices and moisture and gives nice texture to the dish. The paella at Ba Ba Reeba had none of these things from what I could tell - it was a huge portion of very salty rice that didn't appear to have much flavor except salt. I am 95% certain that the rice they use also isn't Bomba rice. I'll give the restaurant credit for truth in advertising - this dish could easily feed 2-4 adults. Honestly, I would have preferred getting half the portion but twice the quality. Considering I spent $32 on this and am seriously considering throwing out the 75% I wasn't able to finish, tells you how underwhelming this is. 1.5 stars out of 5.
