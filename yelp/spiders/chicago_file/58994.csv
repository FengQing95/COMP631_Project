Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Service and staff were really good. They were very helpful and polite. The food was presented well. The lighting was a nice romantics dim so it's perfect for dates. Tapas were different from what I'm used to but we enjoyed it. We got the stuffed mushrooms, spicy potatoes, empanada, and calamari to start off.
