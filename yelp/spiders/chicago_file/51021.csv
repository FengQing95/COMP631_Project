Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My favorite place for brunch in the city! I've been here at least 10 times and each time is just as wonderful as the last. Their brunch menu is amazing. Not only do you get the full dinner menu, but all of the brunch options as well. I always have to get the potatoes and bacon wrapped dates, but every dish is excellent. The bloody marry bar is an added bonus to the great food!
