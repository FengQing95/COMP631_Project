Smoque BBQ////The location was very crowded but the line moved fairly well.  We left after 8 and the line outside was just as long as when we arrived.  I will say that once inside I didn't feel crowded nor did I feel rushed.  I noticed people brought in their own beer and wine.  Apparently there is no corking fee.
