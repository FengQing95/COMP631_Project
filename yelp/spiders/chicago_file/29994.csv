Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We wanted to try both the Lou and the Malnati's and so the two of us got a personal size of each. The pictures looked small online so we were worried we'd still be hungry but we were both very full by the time we were finished (I'm sure the bloody mary had something to do with that). I preferred the Lou over the Malnati because it reminded me of a margarita pizza since it was vegetarian and had a good amount of tomatoes.
