Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////2) Southern Fried Chicken: This dish came out incredibly hot temperature-wise, which really tested our patience as our first scorching bites were delicious. The chicken was perfectly breaded and crunchy on the outside and the chicken was very moist and flavorful on the inside. The homemade buttermilk ranch and bottle of hotsauce really kicked up the flavors in the chicken, making it some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. The only "odd" thing about this dish was that it seemed so out of place with the other offerings on the menu and the classy atmosphere of the restaurant. That aside, I'd gladly dig into a plate of piping hot fried chicken at Bavette's anytime.
