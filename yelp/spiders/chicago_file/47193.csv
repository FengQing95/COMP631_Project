Smoque BBQ////This place serves food so delicious it could make me lapse into cheezy double entendres: holy smoque! for example.  I love this food, but I've never actually gone inside, making this a half-assed review, having only picked up to-go orders. But I sat in the car while my friend ran in, and even THAT was great!  Anyway, we enjoyed delicious pork-n-beans, cornbread muffin, and pulled pork sammy with uber delicious slaw. You will love it, I guarantee. It makes me embrace my inner redneck, after all these years. Need more joints like this in my neighborhood. Be prepared to consume massive amounts, you barbeskue loving carnivores.
