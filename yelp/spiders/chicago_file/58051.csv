Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We were looking for a last minute place to brunch and many of the common go-to spots were booked for reservations. Ba-Ba-Reeba had openings for us so we tried it out. We sat in the patio and it was absolutely beautiful with the indirect sunshine coming through.The Bloody Mary bar was totally worth it - the spread of add-ins was unbeatable! We ordered from the brunch and regular menu of tapas. My favorites were the grilled octopus, citrus cured salmon, and the brunch menu paella (photo attached). The bread service was top quality. I'm definitely coming back to try the other tapas options. One thing I wish was different - I wish the food came out all at the same time.
