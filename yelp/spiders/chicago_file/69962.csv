Little Goat Diner////Really, all I would be doing is echoing the thousands of others that love this place.  My buddy and I were in the neighborhood and started at Haymarket, where we were told that the wait was about 40 minutes.  We headed to Au Chevel, and got the wait down to 35 minutes.  Took a stab at Little Goat, where the dining room wait was 30 minutes, but we were invited to try our luck at the bar.  While crowded, we were able to get a couple stools together.
