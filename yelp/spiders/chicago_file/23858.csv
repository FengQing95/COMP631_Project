Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Welp I expected more from this place, I don't know if it's cause we're from Cali and we have really good pizza but to be honest I've have better Round Table and Mountain Mike's than this, def not worth the 1 1/2 hr wait it took. Pizza was salty and dry, more sauce would have been nice. Our salad was better than the darn pizza lol. P.s not too many topping options either
