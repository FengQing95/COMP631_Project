Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We went here on a Thursday night around 8 and there was no wait. We ordered calamari for appetizer and a medium famous deep dish with sausage and mushrooms. The appetizer arrived shortly and it was delicious. The pizza took about 25 minutes (on the menu it says it'll take about 30 mins), and it was definitely worth it. The pizza was really cheesy and meaty and really filling. I love pizza and could almost eat a whole pizza by myself but only 2 slices of this pizza and I was full because it was so packed with cheese and sausage.
