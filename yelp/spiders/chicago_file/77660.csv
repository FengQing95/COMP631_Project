Little Goat Diner////I decided to get the Los Drowned sandwich (or sammiche as they call it here) and my friend got the Pork Belly pancake. Both of our sandwiches were SO SO DELICIOUS. I mean the flavors were on point and unlike anything I've had before. I could see a lot of Asian flavor influences on the menu like in the Pork Belly pancake (which was an open-faced scallion pancake topped with lots of pork belly chunk goodness, a nice citrusy/acidic bok choy salad, and some crunch) and the "kimchi" mayo in my braised beef sammiche. The cut of beef was so tender that I thought I was eating a quality prime rib sandwich! Generously large sandwich. It was served with au jus, which I've never had before so I might be wrong, but it tasted a little bland and greasy.
