The Purple Pig////Crispy Pig's Ear - this took me by surprise! It's vastly different from the Asian style pig's ear with chili oil. It almost tasted like zucchini fries (I would've never guessed that it's pig's ear). It was fried with kale and topped with a sunny side up egg. The kale was SO good which totally blew me away because it was savory rather than bitter.
