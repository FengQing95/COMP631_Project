Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ordered the pintxo platter which was pretty good. I was pleasantly surprised by the tuna. We also got the individual portion of the valencia paella. It was ok but not my favorite. There were no crispy rice bits!! I was very disappointed by the potato salad. It was gross, very mayo-y and not garlic-y enough. The grilled chicken skewer with chickpea salad was great. The beef skewer with horseradish was tasty. The chicken empanada was good but under seasoned. The meatballs were delicious and the fried calamari was amazing....some of the most tender I've had.
