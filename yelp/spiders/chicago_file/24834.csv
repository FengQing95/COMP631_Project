Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Deep dish pizza was on my mind before I even hopped on the plane from Vegas to Chicago. Just like in New York, Chicago is no exception when it comes to pizza joints battling out to claim themselves as the best pizzeria for deep dish. Fortunately, based on the helpful suggestions of several locals, my friends and I chose Lou Malnati's as our culinary introduction to Chicago.
