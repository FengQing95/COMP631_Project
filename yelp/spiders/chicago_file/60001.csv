Smoque BBQ////From where I live Smoque might as well be in Wisconsin.   However, as far as Smoque seems to be from my house in the West Loop, it really doesn't take that long because its right off 90/94 at Lawrence.   Well, that is if there isn't traffic.  Luckily both times we went the highway was wide open.
