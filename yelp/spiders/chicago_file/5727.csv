The Purple Pig////Honestly wish we had a different server (the other server working seemed really friendly), as unfortunately, this ruined the experience for us and we ended up going somewhere else for dessert because we wanted a more positive experience. Literally bare minimum of answering questions and a smile? If the service was better, I most likely would have given 5 stars. I don't think I'll be back.
