Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The Deep Dish aspect in itself wasn't bad, and that was the only aspect that worked for me. The crust is great. Also, it wasn't veryyyyyyy cheesy and had a good sauce flavor. However, I'm not into a plain Margherita style pizza so the lack of enough toppings didn't do it for me.
