Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you want a Chicago deep dish pizza with a local unpretentious crowd, this is it! We got there around 4 it was very mellow. We ordered a salad and pizza for two and the portions were more than enough. The crunchy crust was my favorite, and the toppings tasted fresh. If you're an out of towner, this is the place to try. The walls were decorated in sports memorabilia and tv's. You'll feel relaxed and at home.
