Smoque BBQ////But alas. I have found my oasis of southern BBQ in Old Irving, right in the middle of the North side. Bonus points for the blue line. Bonus points for the 24 hour Pulaski bus. More bonus points for a short bus ride to a short bus ride to the HIP (just in case you wanted to shop til you drop as the food coma kicks in).
