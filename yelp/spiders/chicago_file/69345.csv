Little Goat Diner////Delightful meal!! Great portion sizes and gracious service. Don't let the diner label misguide you! The food here is superb and the quality of the produce, coffee, dairy, and meat is amazing. Even if you are starving when you come in, beware of the generous portion sizes. Share your food!! Even if it's just to try as many items as you can! (Personal vegetarian favorites / hash browns and vegetarian quesadilla)
