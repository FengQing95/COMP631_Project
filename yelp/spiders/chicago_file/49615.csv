Smoque BBQ////I have been going to Smoque since it opened and I am a super fan and so is my entire family.  We go regularly.  I love evrything in this place.  my only objection is that the pulled pork is not for carry out.  I would recommend having it at Smoque's which is a challenge give the cult following the place has gotten.  oh, and no sweet potato fries.  WHAT!?!
