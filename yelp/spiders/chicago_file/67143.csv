Little Goat Diner////+How is the decor? Â It's pretty inside- actually reminds me a little of Maude's Liquor Bar down the street, with the white subway tile and white hexagon mosaic tile... very modern and elegant without being stark as it's offset by reclaimed wood and old school light fixtures and a large french style mirror (in the bakery above the bar). And the centerpiece light fixture suspended from the skylight of the diner was purdy too.
