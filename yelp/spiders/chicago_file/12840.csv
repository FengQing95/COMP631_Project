Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As a Chicagoan, I have to say that this is NOT the best deep dish pizza in the city. Cheddar cheese does not belong in deep dish, and I don't think they use the best tomatoes here for the sauce. It was really acidic, and didn't really balance well with the crust and cheese.
