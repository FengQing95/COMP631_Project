Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've been there once before, and had a steak, which was good. Better than the rest of the Chicago steakhouses in Chicago? Not really, but good. The night I dined, I was really just looking for something lighter than a big steak. I ordered the Shaved Prime Rib sandwich. It was good, but certainly not worth the hype the server dished out. Kind of an expensive beef sandwich on a nice crusty baguette. We ordered that with the frites & the garlic aioli. For $7, how about some double or triple fried frites? Hand cut? The fries tasted no better than your average fries that you get with the local gyro sandwich. There certainly could have been more thought put into something as simple as frites, especially at Bavettes. I wouldn't go to a restaurant based on frites, but c'mon, you can do better than these.
