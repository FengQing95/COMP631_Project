Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time trying deep dish pizzas in Chicago. The classic deep dish pizza definitely lived up to its name, very simple and straight forward, but I can't help but feel that there was something missing. The sauce was good and the lean sausage was excellent. I really enjoyed it but I wasn't super amazed. It's a great simple deep dish pizza though. The pizza chips (I think that's what it was called) were good to share. There were three dips- one garlicky, one creamy, and one like hummus. Those were quite nice with the freshly diced tomatoes on top.
