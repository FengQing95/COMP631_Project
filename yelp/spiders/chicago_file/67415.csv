Little Goat Diner////I am trying hard to love this place, but right now I'm stuck on liking it just okay. Okay enough to return, since it's on the same block as where I work (another restaurant) and I can always snag a counter seat in the later afternoon for a salad and coffee before my shift starts at 4:30.
