Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Im glad I read previous reviews about the long wait time I ordered a house salad to start to hold me over. Let me tell you, it is definitely worth the wait! So freaking good. They are very busy here so everything takes a while to get but try the local beer selection! You won't be disappointed:)
