Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm not a pizza snob. We don't have a real "Chicago Style" shop in Grand rapids so I was looking forward to this stop. We were on a layover stop on the railroad waiting to board the "City of New Orleans" to head south. We grabbed a cab at the station and told the driver to take us to the BEST pizza place in the area. WE HIT GOLD!
