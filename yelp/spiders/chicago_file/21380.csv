Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Omg no.  Maybe I'm just not a big fan of deep dish pizza but I don't understand the appeal here at all.  I was visiting Chicago for the first time and was urged by numerous acquaintances (I am reluctant to call them friends now) to visit this place for deep dish pizza.  We came here on a Sunday afternoon, and had no wait.  Ordered the Malnati Salad to start, and that was fine.  No qualms there - it was your standard chain restaurant salad.
