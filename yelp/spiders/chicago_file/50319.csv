Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is by far the best tapas restaurant in the Chicago area. We had the garlic potato salad, ham and chicken croquetas, seared Spanish sausages, chicken empanada, and to top it off mini ice cream sandwiches(pumpkin ice cream filled). I'm giving this place a 5/5 because the service, food, and drinks were on point. Will be returning as soon as possible.
