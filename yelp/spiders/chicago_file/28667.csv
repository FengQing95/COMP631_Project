Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The Lou has mushrooms, spinach and garlic which gave it a lot of flavor. The classic was tomato-y with tasty sausage baked in. The cheese was melty and gooey (obviously delicious!). The crust was buttery and tasted like the best carbs i've had in a while! I wanted to try the chocolate chip cookie pizza but we were too stuffed (we had a stan's donut appetizer right before). Next time chicago!
