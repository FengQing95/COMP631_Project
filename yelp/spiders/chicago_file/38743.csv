Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I enjoyed the food but in Chicago there is better. We ordered oysters, bone marrow, and shrimp de jonghe to start off with. All were very good. I ordered the petite filet mignon Oscar style. I didn't really care for the sauce that came with the King Crab/Oscar style option. We also ordered a side of mushrooms but there was too much salt. The lemon meringue pie was fine.
