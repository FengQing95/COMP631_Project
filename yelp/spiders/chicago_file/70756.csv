Little Goat Diner////Absolutely love this place. Never had a less-than-stellar experience no matter the time of day, length of wait, or how crowded they might be. Staff is always helpful and personable, and more often than not, hilarious. Flavors are perfectly balanced and make sense after they hit the palate, though they may sound slightly insane on the menu. I'm as gluten-free as I can be, and the staff is typically very open to helping me figure out ways to modify dishes as needed. Nary a blink of the eye with questions about what might be in a dish or with requests for no bun on a bahn mi burger. Totally worth the wait for Sunday brunch, too.
