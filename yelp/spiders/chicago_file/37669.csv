Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For the main course, we all ordered different cuts of steak. I had the petite filet mignon cooked well (I know, I know, but Bavettes didn't even blink an eye and made the steak to perfection!!) Even though it was well done, it was melt-in-your-mouth perfect! My fianc√© ordered the traditional filet mignon medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. He stated this was the best steak he's ever had! My family ordered the Dry Aged Bone-in Ribeye to share (because its 22 ounces!) and they stated it was an amazing experience.
