Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Recently ate at Wildberry Cafe for the first time and really enjoyed it.  We went at noon on a Saturday for a late breakfast/brunch.  We had a group of 6, so we were able to call ahead.  The place was PACKED and we still had to wait about 20 minutes for a table, but I expected to wait longer, given how busy it was.  The service was good and the food was excellent.  All 6 of us enjoyed our meals and said we would return.  All in all, a really good breakfast spot that I would definitely recommend!
