Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Shortrib Stroganoff - Since we were all getting steaks as our entree, we just ended up getting this as our appetizer since its a popular dish that we all wanted to try. The shortribs had a good bold flavor and were fall apart tender. The stroganoff had a real rich, creamy sauce that we ended up sopping up with the leftover bread. Goddamn my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Definitely recommend trying this entree.
