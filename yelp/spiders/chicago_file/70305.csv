Little Goat Diner////Though we didnt think every dish we ordered was out of this world, I wouldnt hesitate to go back. Especially for an iced coffee and scone - I cant emphasize enough how well executed these two simple, easy to overlook menu items were. That type of fare seems to be where Little Goat shines.
