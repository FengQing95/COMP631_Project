Little Goat Diner////Came here with my parents and boyfriend on Sunday, after the Hot Chocolate 5k. As to be expected for a party of four near 11 a.m., we were quoted a two hour wait. Luckily we were seated after forty minutes. Food and service were both great, I ordered the Parathas Burrito while my boyfriend ordered the Everything is Everything Crumpets. Both were great without being overwhelmingly heavy, although I couldn't finish my order.
