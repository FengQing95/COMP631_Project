Little Goat Diner////Last but not least, there is most likely going to be a long-ish wait for a table (no reservations accepted). However, they have a really efficient system where they text you when your table is ready. It also gives you a personalized webpage where you can periodically check the status of your wait. We had just enough time to walk down the street to Haymarket to get a beer, and were immediately seated after getting the text / returning to the restaurant.
