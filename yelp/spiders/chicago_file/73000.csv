Little Goat Diner////I also got the turkey sandwich to go.  The turkey sandwich was good.  It had roasted almonds on it and a blue cheese that gave it a very unique flavor.  That being said, the bread was pretty unimpressive, and considering that they are baking it fresh, it was a big disappointment.
