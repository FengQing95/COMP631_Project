Art Institute of Chicago////The Modern Wing is beautiful with its natural light but the post-1940s collection is broken up with some there and some in another location in the main building (near the Special Collections, upstairs from the marble sculptures). The no-mans land which has always existed (on the east side of the courtyard, formerly housing the Hindu and Islamic arts) is still struggling for foot traffic. The photography exhibits are easily forgotten in their basement-level, dark space and the armory well, I'm not even sure where all that went.
