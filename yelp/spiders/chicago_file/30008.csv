Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place is BEAUTIFUL. I love how industrial, yet inviting it is. The name caught my eye, but the inside was just so cute and authentic. A very family- oriented, yet fun restaurant. The downstairs was bustling with people, but the upstairs was better suited for larger parties. The restaurant looks like you're in an Italian home. The service was amazing and the food was great too. Very fresh and yummy. I even asked for plain pasta that wasn't on the menu (I'm picky) and the waiter accommodated me. Would go again!
