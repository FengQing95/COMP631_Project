Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The second minus regards one of my orders.  I ordered the rioja short ribs with mashed potatoes.  Pluralizing "rib" was misleading, because I got one tiny slice of meat that was about... 1" x 6'" and 1/4" high, with maybe a 1/2 cup of mashed potatoes, and it cost me $8.50.  I respect and revere the animals we eat, but I expect a little more out of $9.  Wouldn't you?
