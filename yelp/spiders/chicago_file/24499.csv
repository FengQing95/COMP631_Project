Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My girlfriend and I always get a plain cheese pizza, although this time she requested anchovies on the side (I can't stand them). Understandably, the staff accidentally put them on top of the pizza. We wouldn't have even said anything, considering how weird our request was at such a busy time, but manager (owner/etc.?) Matt came to personally apologize to us, bring us a SECOND pizza free of charge (both ended up being free) and even personally served the pizza to us. We couldn't believe how nice the staff was about such an understandable mistake. Great pizza and great people.
