Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Waited in line over 1.5 hours after placing pizza order. A table sat empty where we were standing, they would not seat us. They lost pizza order and was about at least another hour before pizza came. Sausage like a pizza patty in the pizza will not be back. Service fair no smiles or welcome. We felt in the way.
