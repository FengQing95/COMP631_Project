Little Goat Diner////We got the machos nachos to start and those were great! The nachos are loaded and the chips are thick and crispy. For my main dish I got the Little Piggy Went to China and it was reallyyy good!! I'd definitely recommend getting this dish since the Sichuan flavors with a classic cheddar biscuit pairs so well together. I also got to try some of the shrimp and pork belly noodles and this dish was good too. I liked how mushrooms were mixed in with the noodles to give it more flavor.
