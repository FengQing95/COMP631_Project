The Purple Pig////We were worried about having to wait for a long time, so we went around 2:30 on Friday. We were surprised when it was very busy, and the woman told us that we would be seated around 20 to 30 minutes. So we just decide to get a drink at the bar, but before we received our drinks, we are already being called for seating. Sweet!
