Smoque BBQ////Smoque was exactly what I thought it would be - a BBQ joint, no frills, divine brisket, ribs, and sausage (and probably pulled pork and chicken but they ran out due to the abundance of Super Bowl orders received), delicious sides, and it's BYOB so I got to enjoy it all with some Begyle American Pale Ale, and a Hop Whoopin'.   Honestly guys, the brisket was the best I've had in Chicago no contest...perfectly smoked and tender with delicious burnt bits here and there.
