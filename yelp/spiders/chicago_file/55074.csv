Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I'm not sure why people rave about this place - food is mediocre. I've been coming for years, it was better 10 yrs ago - the quality of the food has diminished, seems more fast food - churning out lots of product for the masses. Today we ordered deviled eggs, which were $2.50 EACH little half, they tasted ok; got the empanada, Brussels salad, spicy potatoes (which were super salty and too much paprika) but the worst was we ordered the grilled octopus and upon arriving at the table you could smell the octopus was bad!!! Â The waitress came over to check on us and she could smell the bad octopus! She took it off the bill, paid and left.
