Little Goat Diner////Lastly the service was phenomenal ... Water was always refilled the moment it got to half.  A friendly passing of the staff to make sure everything was good happened throughout the night but it never felt intrusive.  Just a gentle pulse to make sure everything was perfect.  I do admit the speed of service was incredibly fast.  I think we got the tuna melt I under 5 minutes.
