Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Honestly it isn't THE best breakfast place, but I still like it. I loved the decor, simple and cute. I ordered a waffle with strawberries and a side of bacon. My friend had an omelet we both enjoyed our meals and the waiter was nice. The only thing that would keep me coming back is knowing that I will be treated nicely. This place is like, I want breakfast and I'm in the area. I will back someday even though I have my other top choices for breakfast.
