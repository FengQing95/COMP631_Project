Smoque BBQ////I'm from the southeast, home to the kings of BBQ.  Trust me, I wanted to knock this place a little because of it's distance from the true BBQ capital but I can't.  What I ate here, my god, I hate to say this but I've had the best BBQ ever and it didn't come from the south.  It came from Smoque.
