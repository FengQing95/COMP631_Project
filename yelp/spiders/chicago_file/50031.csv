Smoque BBQ////We had the pulled pork, ribs and sausage.  I would say that the pulled pork and sausage were excellent with a lot of smokey flavor.  The ribs were fairly bland even though there was a nice crust on the top.  The sauces that accompanied the meats were very tasty so, it is a must to have them with the ribs.  Macaroni and cheese were so so and the cole slaw was more salad than slaw.  I would definitely go again and go all out with the pulled pork!
