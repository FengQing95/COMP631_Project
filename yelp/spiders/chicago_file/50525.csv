Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My first experience with Baba was in 2000. Wow! So long ago and I've been coming back ever since. I've tried some of the other popular Chicago Tapas restaurants such as Emilio's and Iberico and they don't compare in terms of taste, ambiance or even service. Not to mention that Babareeba has an awesome happy hour every day that is a steal.
