Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Once we were seated our waiter attempted to take our drink order again but finally we communicated that we already had an order and eventually got the drinks. We had to ask him about recommendations though... He didn't offer them up until we asked.  We started ordering a starter (duck terrine) and the waiter tool my husbands menu away!  So we then had to share a menu to decide what to order.
