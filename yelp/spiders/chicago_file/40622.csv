Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Foodwise, the steaks were delicious. We ordered the steaks and frites and the filet mignon. Both cooked perfectly at medium rare. The frites were so delicious, if you don't order the meal, would recommend getting them as a side. We also ordered the mushrooms which were good though a bit over seasoned. We had the chocolate pie as dessert, and they were so sweet they added a surprise candle.
