Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My boyfriend and I returned for Sunday brunch and were very pleased with our experience here. The specialty mango sangria was incredibly tasty. We split some veggie-friendly dishes such as the potato omelet, the eggs benedict, and the stuffed mushrooms. Though my boyfriend isn't vegetarian, he thoroughly enjoyed these dishes alongside me. Jane was our server and was very attentive and friendly. We're happy we gave this place a second chance and will likely return.
