Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Owners of this place also own a couple of other nearby establishments--Gilt, which like Bavette's, has a 1920's /Capone speakeasy vibe, and Donut Vault. Highly recommend and conveniently located behind the Merchandise Mart on Kinzie and real close to the Wells Street bridge,
