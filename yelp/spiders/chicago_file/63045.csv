Smoque BBQ////I have never had better. Wow. Anyways, what's cool here is if you are an indecisive eater like me here you can have the 1/2 & 1/2 which features half an order of the pulled pork and half an order of the brisket. This also comes with 1 side. I tried the mac 'n cheese which was also heavenly. It was simple yet refined. One of the best m'n'c's that I've had. No fancy schmancy cheeses here but I swear tastes amazing. I also opted to try the cornbread, which was nothing special. I personally prefer my cornbread on the sweeter side. I wish I ordered myself the peach cobbler bc it looked delish, but oh well next time.
