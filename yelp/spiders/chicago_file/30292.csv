Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I loved everything about that pizza. So thick and unlike any pizza I've ever tried before. I am so sad that I've waited so long to try this style pizza but I am so glad it was at a place that clearly is doing something right. To make it clear, I am no expert on Chicago pizza but I am certainly an expert on pizza in general...and by expert I mean I eat a lot of pizza. Hehe.
