Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Amazing food, great variety, delicious sangria, and romantic atmosphere.  This place is great for a date night with your SO or dinner with a group of friends!  I recommend trying a little of everything and also asking the waiter/waitress for their recommendations.  The goat cheese with tomato sauce is one of my faves- simple yet so delicious!
