Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////i moved to Chicago about 3 years ago and could not try the pizza fast enough that every one talks so highly about. it was different than florida pizza being that it was so thick and takes 45 minutes to cook. but it was well worth the wait and now Every time I visit Chicago i always have to stop by and have some of their original deep dish pizza. Â  It is by far the most delicious pizza I have experienced.
