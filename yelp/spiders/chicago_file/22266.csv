Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza itself was delicious I loved every bit of it. It's definitely more of a pie or cake, which is to be expected since it's a deep dish. The layers of meat and cheese and sauce keep you coming back bite after bite. Before you know it you've had two slices and are like geez... I still have another slice left and I'm stuffed.
