The Purple Pig////So I'll start off by saying that the wait was atrocious and their open seating policy for the bar is aggressive and awful and that's literally the only reason this is a 4 instead of a 5. It killed 30 minutes of my time and was just super unpleasant. Of course the aggressive guys got seats before me even though they got there after me. Also, it's generally just rude to have people staring you down as you're finishing your meal. NOT a fan -- they are way too popular to have this arrangement.
