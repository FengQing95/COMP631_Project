Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The crust was really good and had crisp edges with good texture, the sausage was well seasoned and perfect in portion relative to the cheese. And boy there is a good amount of cheese, that was my favorite part. I loved how the cheese was really cheesy and every bite had a perfect portion of sausage, cheese, sauce, and that buttery crust. This pizza was well worth the trip. Now Chicago style deep dish here is very different from deep dish in California. In California there's more sauce and substance, where was in Chicago the content and cheese are the main stars. Either way, great dish and I would love to come back to eat here again when in the area.
