Art Institute of Chicago////We had about 6.5 hours to kill and went to see the Saints and Heros collection at the Institute. I've been to the Smithsonian many times so I have a high standard of what I expect. I was not disappointed. We went for the armor exhibit but I was smitten. I ran around that place like a mad woman snapping pics. I got to everything but modern art. I didn't get to fully appreciate it bc of time constraints but I got some wonderful pictures and will be reviewing them for details. I highly recommend it.
