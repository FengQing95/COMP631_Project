Smoque BBQ//// is in a very nice family neighborhood. maybe she was talking about the south side where maybe she is from. the food is really good and i have never had a dry cornbread or a dry mac and cheese. i suggest you go back on a different day so you can see what is a correct judgement! linda on the north west side.
