Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The appetizer bread was delicious and is great when accompanying the tapas. Absolutely suggest the sangria. I had the black raspberry sangria which was the most delicious sangria I had ever had. Extremely refreshing and not too sweet. I would definitely be back because there were so many things we wanted to try still!
