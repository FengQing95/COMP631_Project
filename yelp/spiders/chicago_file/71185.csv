Little Goat Diner////LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my shrimp and cheesy grit dish, with the homemade biscuit. Smothered this flaky biscuit with the creamy butter and yummy rhubarb jam. I had this for dinner - just what I was looking for when I was seeking out unique culinary dishes. Nice atmosphere and was served very quickly by our wait staff. Highly recommend this place.
