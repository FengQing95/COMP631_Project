Smoque BBQ////Their ribs: Carolina and St. Louis-style both use dry rubs consisting of spices, tomatoes and vinegar in a very balanced fashion. What's particularly special about these ribs is that you can really taste the smokiness of the meat. Unlike other popular styles of BBQ, the meat here do not come off the bone completely, which I learned that the chefs have done intentionally to give the meat more texture.
