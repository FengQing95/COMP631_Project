Art Institute of Chicago////Although the collection is quite good, the downside of this museum is that the interior is very confusing..there are 3 floors and most galleries are in the building but there is actually a separate building (this is helpful to know!) and just looking at the map, it is very difficult to figure out how to get there. Nighthawks is in the separate building so make sure to find it!
