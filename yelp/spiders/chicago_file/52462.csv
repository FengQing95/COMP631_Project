Smoque BBQ////Getting home with my bag'o'meat I hoped for the best and prepared for the average.  Below average is what I got.  I don't recall ever seeing such a skinny, scrawny bunch of ribs.  The pig was obviously an anorexic with self image issues.  The chewiness of the meat though was ideal - I don't believe that meat is supposed to 'fall of the bone,' I like something that fights back a bit.  The seasoning was only on the surface, not throughout the meat.  The smoky flavor tho was throughout the meat, and was quite nice.  But then there was the sauce.  It's cute how the sauce was served on the side as if it may ruin the majesty of the rub that was used.  Perhaps the reason is that the sauce was so...bad.  It was definitely better than Open Pit, but not as good as Sweet Baby Ray's, which is available on the shelf at Dominick's.   Still I was certain the brisket would save me.  Wrong!  Since when is brisket dry?  This is actually the worse brisket I've had.  I gave it to my cat but she wouldn't eat it.  However, if you like Smoque's brisket, know that the $3 taste portion is a generous amount.  The fries were excellent!  I haven't tried the pulled pork yet, but fear it may end up in the trash to keep the scrawny ribs company.
