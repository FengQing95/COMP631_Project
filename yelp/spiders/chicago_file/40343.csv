Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Went for Valentine's Day. It's very dark and romantic. There is a 1 hour 45 min time limit but they don't rush you. Bone marrow was amazing and a much bigger portion than I've ever seen; great for splitting. Wine bottle options are reasonable for a steakhouse, especially the house bottles. Steak was cooked perfectly. Pro tip- if you're sharing a steak, ask to have it sliced. Have been here 20+ times and will keep coming back. Never disappoints!
