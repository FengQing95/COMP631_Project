Little Goat Diner////As I was finishing up, chef dropped by to say hello and ask how I enjoyed the waffles.  Very much, thank you.  She then mentioned that she had made them herself.  How cool is that?!?  I told her that we love her places and live in the neighborhood.  I thanked her for all of the great craft beers on the menu and then she grabbed us tasters of her Haymarket collaboration Girl and the Goat 3 brew.  Cheers Chef, what a treat this was!  And let me channel my inner Brent Musberger, Chef's beaming smile and amiable personality set the tone for a great vibe.
