Little Goat Diner////Wanted to love this place, it wasn't bad, it just didn't live up to my expectations.  My girlfriend got the shrimp and grits which was more like a vegetable stew with a few shrimp and grits sprinkled throughout.  I got the bullseye french toast which was delicious, but almost too rich for my taste.  Portion size is fine, but I expected much more wow factor and bang for my buck at this price point.  We also tried the hot crab dip which was pretty good despite still having shells in it.  The waitress gets points for having good customer service and for bringing us extra crackers without us having to ask, because the 8 crackers it comes with aren't enough to take down a third of the dip.  This place isn't a bad brunch spot, but nothing to go out of your way for.
