Smoque BBQ////Comparing this place to Fat Willy's Rib Shack...I think the pulled pork at Fat Willy's is better.  And FW has pulled chicken, which Smoque does not.  And I think Fat Willy's BBQ sauce is better.  Plus, they give you two sauces and leave them on the table!  Score!  I have to say I like Fat Willy's better.  There is no drama with seating--you give your name and wait until you are seated.  The seating at Smoque is kinda a pain but they do a good job trying to manage it.
