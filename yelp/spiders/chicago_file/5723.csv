The Purple Pig////The Purple Pig would fit right in to the NYC food scene. Once we were in and seated, it really did remind me of a hip tappas place in NY. We visited on a Monday a little after the typical lunch rush. We were seated at the bar that literally looks straight into the kitchen so you can see exactly how dishes are put together.
