Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is exactly what I want in a steak house. Perfectly cooked steaks, delicious sides, large portions, a cool vibe.  The Chicago ribeye was fantastic.  The elotes and the broccoli sides were a perfect compliment to the decadent steaks. The crab stuffed avocado was a perfect opening to go along with the fresh sourdough bread. The drink list was well balanced and the fact that they had Pappy Van Winkle available made my night. Great service from friendly and helpful servers also made the experience even better.
