The Purple Pig////For a party of two, we ordered 3 dishes and shared. The servers recommended 2 dishes per person, however since we aren't huge eaters we decided on 3. We ordered the bone marrow, octopus, and pork shoulder. This was my first time trying bone marrow and I was not expecting it and did not enjoy it as much as others might've. The octopus was my favourite at around $20 a plate. It wasn't an overly large plate, but it was quite delicious. It has a mix of veggies and sauce and had a good char to it. The shoulder was tender and very soft, but to pair it with mashed potatoes on the bottom seemed like a scoop of mush.
