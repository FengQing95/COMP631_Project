Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We shared the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, which was really delicious ($8), and had a plate of soy-orange duck wings which were the special that evening and should go on the permanent menu, they were so tender and tasty. We attempted to order 1/2 a pitcher of the blood orange sangria (also a special for the evening) but apparently the server heard "HAVE a pitcher of sangria," and brought us a full one, which we didn't figure out til we looked at the bill. I thought it was a little generous for a half, but didn't ask! Oh well. Guess someone's gonna have to drink all that extra sangria. Shucks!
