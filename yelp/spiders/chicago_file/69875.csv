Little Goat Diner////Over priced , over hyped and just average food.   I will never make an effort to just go there, maybe if am close by?    Despite having a reservation on two occasions , we still waited 45 minutes for our table and for the mediocre food.    I expect more from a Top Chef winner who I support at her other ventures.    You can do much better, but seems like the folks who frequent here just want to trendy and will pack it and not demand better food.
