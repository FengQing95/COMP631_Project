Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Yesterday I was shorted two toppings that I ordered. I went over my order on the phone at least 3-4 times. But I didn't receive my onions or green pepper. The ingredients that I did receive were barely on there. I could count on two hands the amount of sausage crumbles I received.
