Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I would definitely suggest to check-in on foursquare as you get a free pintxo. Throughout all the times I've been for dinner, I've learned you can never go without their red sangria. You don't realize it at first, but after a few sips, it does you in for the night. The tortilla, patatas bravas (the BEST choice, esp for that damn good sauce), stuffed mushrooms, goat cheese baked in tomato, the calamari and octopus are all phenomenal.
