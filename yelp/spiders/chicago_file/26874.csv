Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Legit a$$ pizza!!!!!!!!! This place was last on my itinerary, but I wish we came here the first thing we landed in Chicago. Had to order to go since we were running a bit late to the airport for our flight back home. We ordered a personal "The Malnati Chicago Classic". Came out so fresh and it was perfect for two people to share, it was also perfect for my hangover that I had that morning. I really didn't expect much since I don't like New York style pizza's at all, but you MUST try Lou Malnati's. Believe the hype because best believe it is that amazing!!!!!!!
