Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This time we ordered the meat platter and the cheese platter, in addition to all the usual tapas dishes we get.  I finally found the membrillo quince on that cheese platter which make me a happy camper!  They used to serve cheese and these quince cubes on small skewers and I had this eons ago, this was taken off the menu on my later visits.  Over all the food was good
