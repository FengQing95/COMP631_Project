Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is the best Chicago deep dish. Cheese is awesome, crust is delicious, n sauce is perfect. There is Lou Malnati's then there is everyone else. Sausage is definitely recommended as well as spinach pizza but just cheese works great too. Their thin Chicago pub style is super tasty too when you wanna mix it up a bit or want something that's not so heavy.
