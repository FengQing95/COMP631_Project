Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've never had a single dish that is bad and this trip was no different. Definitely try to more traditional tapas - tortilla espanola, croquetas, patatas bravas, pulpo... it's making my mouth water just to think about it! My husband and I also shared 1/2 pitcher of the pomegranate sangria that was a feature and it was phenomenal. 1/2 pitcher was about 3 glasses each as they are short glasses. A couple glasses of sangria and some tortilla and you'll feel as though you've been transported to a bar in Puerto del Sol.
