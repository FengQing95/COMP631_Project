Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I have to say it up front, I love the speakeasy atmosphere.  Seems the chicago steakhouses all have distinct personalities.  This time tho, it felt like we had a creepy busser, adding to the "there's a murder about to happen" vibe from a 30's mystery movie.  I expected a woman's scream, a dropped plate, and someone yelling to lock the doors as the suspect responsible for the untimely demise of baron von something must still be inside.
