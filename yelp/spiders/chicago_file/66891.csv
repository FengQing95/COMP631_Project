Little Goat Diner////If you live in the West Loop area I would stop by and try this great New Dinner. I have eaten there twice and the food is amazing. The sandwiches there are so tasty, they are big so you will definantly have lunch tomorrow. If I lived closer I would eat here so much more, and most likely be 20 pounds heavier. Dont forget the biscuits or mac and cheese with your sides.
