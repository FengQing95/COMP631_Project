Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our server was very attentive which I liked, we told him about our diet restriction of pork and alcohol and he was well knowledgeable about what dishes had them and which didn't. We found out that everything fried in a pork fat which crossed half the menu even the Caesar salad as it had crispy chips instead of croutons, so we just skipped the appetizer and the salad.
