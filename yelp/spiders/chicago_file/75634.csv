Little Goat Diner////Service- I wasn't too impressed with the service. When the waitress first came to take our order I told her I couldn't have dairy and asked for suggestions, she said she'd come back to me. She came back a second time and I learned the dish I was looking at had dairy. She came back a third time with the dairy free menu- which I could have received the first time I mentioned I couldn't consume dairy (at the time I was not aware of the second menu). My friends all waited for me to get my food because it took so long for me to get my order in.
