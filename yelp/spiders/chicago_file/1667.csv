Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////We had the veggie skillet as well as the nutella crepes and some coffee.  All of which was really good.  We really didnt see much of our waitress, other than to take our order, and to ask us if everything was ok, but I can't complain because we were otherwise well taken care of and it was in such a great location to our hotel and all of the Chicago downtown attractions that if I ever make it back to Chicago, I will swing in here again.
