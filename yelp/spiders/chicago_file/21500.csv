Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The wife and I ate here two days in a row during our first time in Chicago early February. We've been in Houston our entire lives and never had a Chicago deep dish. Lou Malnatis was excellent. The buffalo wings were a hit. We will definitely make this a regular visit whenever we travel to Chi-town.
