Little Goat Diner////Kimchee & Bacon & Eggs & Pancakes - so eccentric and wonderful.  Neither of us had ever had anything like this dish before.  Typically I like my eggs with cheese, but this dish made me look at eggs a little bit differently and my love for cheese didn't even cross my mind.  It was refreshing and wonderful - I would recommend it to any outside of the box eater out there.
