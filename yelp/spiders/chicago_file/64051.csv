Smoque BBQ////Mac and cheese is good, so are desserts. I'm not a fan of ribs that don't fall off the bone like most Chicagoans so I don't care for them. Still haven't had good restaurant ribs outside of the south to date and I've had most of the hyped rib joint ribs near and far in the Chicago area. The smoked chicken is just ok, I've had it a few times but the real winner here is the smoked brisket.
