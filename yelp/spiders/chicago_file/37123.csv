Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////If you're visiting Chicago, this is a must stop.  It will be for us if we travel here again. Husband and I loved every thing we ordered. Chopped salad was even the best we've ever had.  Brussel sprouts were fabulous. And chocolate cream pie was perfect. Not too sweet.  House red wine was even very good.  Have no complaints.  Ate downstairs which seemed dark at first, but we adjusted quickly. Very cool experience.
