Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////our waiter was extremely helpful and friendly; never felt rushed out of there even though we did go on a busy saturday evening and stayed afterward to just chat. atmosphere was wonderful. great place for a first date or great place to go for great tapas with friends. prices were very reasonable as well! hosts friendly and all staff we encountered was very helpful! cant wait til i get to go again!
