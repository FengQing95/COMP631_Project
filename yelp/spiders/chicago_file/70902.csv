Little Goat Diner////Had a great breakfast here on a Sunday morning at 9:00. Definitely glad we had reservations. Staff was very friendly, quick to refill coffee and the food was good. I had the Bullseye French toast. The chicken could have been a little hotter. It definitely had been cooked earlier. But everything else was spot on and delicious. My spouse had the Spanish omelet and it was delicious, and a little spicier than we anticipated. But we like spicy!
