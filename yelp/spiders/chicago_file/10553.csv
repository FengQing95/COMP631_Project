Art Institute of Chicago////I'm really glad that I had a few hours to spend wandering here on my latest trip to Chicago. I hadn't been inside the museum in a decade and so was really pleased to wander the galleries. Got to see many old favorites and lots of new artists too (check out Onchi Koshiro, you won't be sorry).
