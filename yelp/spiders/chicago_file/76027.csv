Little Goat Diner////After going to girl and the goat, I was very disappointed with Little Goat. My boyfriend and I came here for lunch on a whim when we were in the city. We loved Girl and the Goat and figured we would love this retro diner from the same owner. However, the service left more to be desired and the food wasn't anywhere near as good as Girl and the Goat. A little coffee area is conjoined with the diner. I didn't try the coffee, but it looked really cute and we decided to wait in that area.
