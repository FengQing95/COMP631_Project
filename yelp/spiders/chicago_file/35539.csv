Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Simply awesome! I dined here on my trip home in April and could not be more happy with my experience. Started out with the old fashion and oysters, which were both fantastic. There are also some decent craft beer options. For my meal I had the filet and it was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing! It was probably the best filet I have had, on par with Primehouse, and much better than Gibson's (which I feel has gone downhill a bit). I had the wild mushroom side, and loaded baked potato, both outstanding and again cooked perfectly. The atmosphere is great except it is dark, very dark, which was the only thing I was not a fan of but darkness aside the place is a must! The service was outstanding as well, great staff!
