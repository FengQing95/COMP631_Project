Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love this place. I've tried Twist and Tapas Barcelona and this is still my favorite tapas place. Tapas Barcelona is a close second, but Twist is wayy behind both of these restaurants. I went here on a Tuesday night, which was nice because usually during the weekends it is really really crowded. Between me and my 3 other friends we ordered 9 hot tapas and 4 desserts. I love trying a bunch of different dishes and that's why I really enjoy Tapas and dimsum style places and family style.
