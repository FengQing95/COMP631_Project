Little Goat Diner////The star of the dinner was hands down the dessert and we were NOT expecting that! Each of our friends got a dessert & I tried a bite of each. Cheez-It Sundae!!! OMG. I know it sounds so weird but it just works!!! Try it & don't look back! The gelato it is served with...unbelievable. Our other friend got the cookie shake & it was FILLED with cookies & caramel...so delicious!
