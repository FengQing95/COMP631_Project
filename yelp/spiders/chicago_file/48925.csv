Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been coming to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba for years. You can always count on this place for a good meal and good service. Whether it's a girls night out, date night, or a very large group dinner, I've never had a bad meal here. I always order the same classic tapas: patatas bravas, goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, bacon-wrapped dates, etc. and then I usually like to order some seafood tapas such as Gambas al Ajillo or scallops and maybe throw in a few specials. And you can't forget the sangria! Great food. Great service. Great ambiance.
