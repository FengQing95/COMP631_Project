Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My boyfriend and I went here for our one year anniversary. It was like going back in time. It has this romantic speak easy vibe. The waitstaff is top notch and so attentive without being annoying. We got a beautiful dessert to celebrate our anniversary. I can't wait to go back.
