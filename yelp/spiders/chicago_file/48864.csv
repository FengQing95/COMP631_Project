Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I took a date here recently and we had a lot of fun. The atmosphere and food was great. The portions were sized just right and the flavor of the plates were pretty good. My date enjoyed her cocktails and there was a nice selection of beer for us to enjoy in addition to the desert.
