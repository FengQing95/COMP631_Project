Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We wanted to try this place to see what else is out there aside from our go to Chicago deep dish pizza place. Beautiful location. You have to walk down a couple flights of stairs to get to the dining room so for my elderly parents this would be difficult on them. We were seated right away for our party of 4. Our waiter wasn't attentive and often forgot items that we requested like straws, napkins, etc. We ordered chicken wings as an appetizer and they were delicious and so was the celery that came with it. Our deep dish not so much. It had a strong taste of canned whole tomatoes. We weren't pleased at all. I will say though that we had to take some home and we warmed it in the oven as the box directed and it was a lot better tasting than the day before.
