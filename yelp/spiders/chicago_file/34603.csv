Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Dimly lit, cavernous, toasty room with large leather booths, a couple old couches, and a proper bar.  The music was pretty on point and that tends to make or break a lot of places for me.  Obviously, the envrinoment is a key factor, the service, drinks, food, etc. but music is up there too.
