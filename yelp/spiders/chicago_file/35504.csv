Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Why go elsewhere? This place is always busy, so be sure you have reservations because it's always full. A little tricky to get to, but a worthy trek. The steaks are always of the highest quality and are always cooked perfectly. Name a cut and I have tried it. I love their corn side dish. Although the sides are a bit pricey, you get your money's worth. The drinks are tasty and nice strong and the service is great. Get the bone-in ribeye. You're welcome.
