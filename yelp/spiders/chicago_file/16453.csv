Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Alright after a long day of flight cancellations and what not, the first place we've decided to grab food was here. Chicago is known for their deep dish pizza, so of course we gotta check this place out. Arrived here around 9PM and the place was packed. We waited on line and the server told us to place our order in, so while we wait they'll make it for us. I thought that's a pretty smart idea and that all restaurants should have this option. Okay, except Chinese restaurants because literally you sit down and your food comes in a minute...yea I'm Chinese and I don't even know how they do it.
