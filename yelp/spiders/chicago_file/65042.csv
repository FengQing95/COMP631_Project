Smoque BBQ////Here's my take: Their ribs are very meaty and tender, with a bit of char on the outside.  Slow-cooking melts away most of the fat.  The woody-smoky flavor is just right and does not overwhelm the flavor of the pork.  The meat does not quite fall off the bone, but you don't have to do much gnawing either.  Ribs are served dry, with the sauce on the side.  The "Memphis" BBQ sauce is better'n any I've had in Memphis.
