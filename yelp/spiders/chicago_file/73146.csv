Little Goat Diner////We took my husband's mother (age 79) to this restaurant and she loved it! She raved over her grilled cheese and mentioned that it was one of the best she had tasted. My husband ordered the open-faced tuna sandwich and judging by the way he wolfed it down, it was a hit. I had the chickpea kale salad and it came with falafel and the best tzatziki sauce I've had in a long time. The dressing was just so-so but overall it was a tasty salad. We also shared the rosemary white chocolate scone. At first we thought the rosemary was going to overpower the scone but it ended up being a nice complement. We will definitely return!
