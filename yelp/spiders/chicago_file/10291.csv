Art Institute of Chicago////The Modern art collection is vast and varied. Most every stage of Picasso's life is covered. Short-lived School of the Art Institute student, Georgia O'Keefe is also well-represented, with her "Clouds" dramatically shown over a high staircase. Seeing the work of Southwest artist Arthur Dove next to hers, you can really tell how certain artists influenced each other. The same comparitive device is used in Â the current exhibit: Becoming Edvard Munch.
