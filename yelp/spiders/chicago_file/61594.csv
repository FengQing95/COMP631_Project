Smoque BBQ////Between the two of us we tried the baby back ribs, brisket, pulled pork, slaw, macaroni, beans, fries, cornbread muffin, and pecan bread pudding. The ribs appeared to look burnt but I kid you not the meat literally fell off of the bone and there was absolutely no burnt charcoal taste. The brisket was tender and delicious. The pull pork was full of flavor yet didn't have any big gross chunks of fat.
