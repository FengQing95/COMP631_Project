Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The major issue of our visit came with trying to get out of there! Our waitress took forever to get us our bill. We were just sitting and sitting. We see her delivering pizzas and taking others, but completely neglecting us. When she came with the bill, I had my card in hand for her to take cause I was worried about how long it would take for her to get back to us. Oh man. We were both very disappointed with the time we had to wait.
