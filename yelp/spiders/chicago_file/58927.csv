Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The waffle battered chicken stick was my favorite, and I'd definitely get this again (in fact, I had to order a second while we were there)! The inside is actually a chicken sausage which I wasn't expecting, but it was tasty. The waffle batter was so delicious - nice and light, and balanced nicely with the light and sweet maple syrup! This is, in my opinion, a must try.
