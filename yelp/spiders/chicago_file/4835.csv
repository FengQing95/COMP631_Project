The Purple Pig////I ordered from the Purple Pig for a special birthday celebration and the food was absolutely incredible and very well packaged.  It made for an amazing meal; I would highly recommend them for pick up and can't wait to go in person at a different time!  Favorite dishes included: pork belly, spanish octopus, roasted bone marrow, braised pork shoulder, and chicken thigh kebabs.
