Little Goat Diner////My mom sister and I went here for lunch we ordered the cheesy garlic bread for an app it was so yummy and not just basic. Mom had the pulled pork and I had the Los De...something or other sandwich we were both super happy. My sister got the biscuits and gravy she wasn't as pleased thought it was too salty so didn't really eat it. She did get some of the garlic mashed though and loved that. They could definitely consider serving ice water instead or Luke warm water. We visited at about 1 and they were all ready out of two items we had wanted to order so that kinda stunk but all in all we were really happy.
