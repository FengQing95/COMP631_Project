Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Hands down THE best steak I've ever had. I made a reservation months in advance and even then it was slim pickings. The ambiance is old school and DARK. Service was absolutely amazing and attentive. We were celebrating an anniversary and were given complimentary champagne to toast!
