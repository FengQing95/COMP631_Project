Little Goat Diner////So very cool place, make a reservation if you want to have lunch. I had a Rueben, would have done something different if I went there again after seeing what others were eating but it was good. Â They Club sandwich looked amazing and the chicken salad was what I should have gotten. We got some pork belly fries, these were amazing, low carb diet out the door.
