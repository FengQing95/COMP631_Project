Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Good food, good service, beautiful decor, good cocktail menu--what more could you ask for? We had the baked goat cheese--delicious and enough for 4 people to share, beet salad-- light and tasty, petite filet mignon--delicious, fried chicken--juicy on the inside and crunchy on the outside, corn--good flavors and enough for 4, and the chocolate cream pie--divine. Our bourbon cocktails and the recommended wine were fabulous too. Definitely deserves 5 stars.
