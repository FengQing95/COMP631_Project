Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Now the part that pissed me off:  the greeter at the door.  As we were leaving our musical at 10:30, I called to see if there was a long wait (if so we had the option of carry-out as our condo is very close by), and told no wait.  When we arrived, there was no waiting line, but told the wait was 35-45 minutes.  "A party of 9 just showed up".  Not pleased, but no big deal, just bad luck.  As I went to the restroom on the first floor, I saw a round table with 6 chairs, and asked this "greeter" if we could squeeze 7, rather than stand waiting 35 min or longer to sit down.  Again no one else waiting.  He said no, just go to the bar and get a drink.  OK, I understand.  I walked upstairs to the other restroom(first floor had a wait), and at the top of the stairs was a beautiful table big enough for 7-10, and a few other 4 tops all open, bused and ready.  As i came back downstairs, I tried to think how I could ask again without being obnoxious.  3 employees were standing at the desk talking, so I waited.  The "Greeter" was looking straight ahead and would not acknowledge me, so I thought maybe he was on the phone or something.  No, just rude.  I kept waiting.  A nearby manager asked if I needed something, and before I could answer, my greeter friend said "no, he's just going around the restaurant trying to find a table, and I already told him to wait at the bar."  He still wouldn't talk or acknowledge me.  That is when I got pissed me off.  I wanted to leave, but my family is much nicer than I am, and the manager said he would take care of it.  5 minutes later we were seated and had a great meal and night.
