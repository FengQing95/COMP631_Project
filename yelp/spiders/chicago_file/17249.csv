Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Wow this pizza was soooo delicious. After my bad experience at pequods I decided to come here and try this famous pizza. Â I'm so happy I did the marinara sauce was to die for and the buttery crust was sooo yummy and even though the prices were a little steep I have to admit I loved this pizza. You can even taste the fresh mozzarella which is very rare. It had flavor!!! Definitely come here if you want "the best pizza" but I have to admit it is a tie between here and Pizano's.
