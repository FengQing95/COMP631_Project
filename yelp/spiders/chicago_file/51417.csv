Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Book early! We called in to put our names on the list an hour in advance and still had to wait 45 minutes to get seated. The dimly lit and smokey atmosphere probably would offer an intimate experience if I hadn't come to the restaurant with my goofy friends. A couple huge slabs of meat hung from the ceiling near the bar area, making things feel somehow more authentic.
