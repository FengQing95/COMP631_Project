Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It can be hard to get a table here though without a reservation, or even 2 seats at the bar. The place is big enough, with a large downstairs, but they stay packed. They have those couches with cocktail tables up front where you eat hunched down, or from your lap, but I think those are only any good for drinks and conversations.
