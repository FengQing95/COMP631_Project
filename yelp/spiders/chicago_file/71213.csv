Little Goat Diner////LOVED this place!  The kimchee, eggs, bacon, and pancake I ordered was delicious and not your typical breakfast item.  My friends ordered the Elvis and the Bull's Eye french toast and both were excellent (I had a couple of bites of their meals).  I love that there's a coffee bar adjacent to the main dining area for people who are waiting for their tables.
