Smoque BBQ////For a place known for their BBQ, I enjoyed the Peach Cobbler and the Mac N' Cheese the most.  The Mac as the best I have ever had and the Peach Cobbler was the perfect desert.  I was very excited to come to Smoque, I have been trying to get here for a while.  However, I have to say I was a bit let down.  The sauce was good, but not as good as some of the more famous places in Chicago and the 'burbs.  The chopped brisket was good, but I wish I had noticed the 1/2 and 1/2 (meaning combining any of their sandwiches to get a 1/2 of one and 1/2 of another).  I love both brisket and BBQ pork, so I would liked to have tried both. My wife loved her baby backs and the cornbread, I loved that the Cole slaw wasn't creamy and the beans were just average.
