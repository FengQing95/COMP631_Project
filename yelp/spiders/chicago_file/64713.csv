Smoque BBQ////Loved this place, stopped here before I had to fly out. Ordered the 1/2 slab of baby back ribs. My two sides were the brisket chili, fries, and it already comes with slaw. These ribs were the best I have ever had. I didn't even need bbq sauce. Just ate it dry, meat just fell right off the bones. Loved the way they smoked the ribs, flavor was bursting. Chili was excellent, and fries were great. Their slaw was good, but may take time to get used to it. Overall experience was more then expected. Would love to come back if I'm ever in town again!
