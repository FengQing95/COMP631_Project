Art Institute of Chicago////It was fairly crowded, but too not bad. Pictures were allowed in most areas (without flash). Also, if you have a cell phone, you cannot talk inside most galleries. I probably witnessed 4 or 5 instances were security told people on their phone to leave the gallery and talk elsewhere. If your coming to the AIC, turn off the phone, and enjoy something else beside discussing what so and so put on their Facebook status....
