Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My family went there this past Saturday for lunch. I felt slightly out of place since most of the clientele are younger. However, no regrets for going there. The food was interesting and mostly very good. Pass on the beef & blue cheese, too salty. The chicken empanada was Â excellent. We also enjoyed the paella. They have a baked goat cheese dish that I really enjoyed. The gazpacho soup was above average. This is probably a good place for dating if you are 20 or 30. It has ambiance and good, interesting dishes. They have a brunch menu for weekends. I would have preferred the regular menu. Prices were not cheap but were reasonable for the quality. I would go there again if in the area. Very good tapas restaurant.
