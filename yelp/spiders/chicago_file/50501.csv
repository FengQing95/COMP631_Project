Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I would say this place is great but it is not OMG AMAZING or worth the crazy hype that it gets. It's definitely a fun spot to go with a group of friends because they actually take reservations. It does give off that chain restaurant vibe but it is balanced out with the good food and drinks they offer.
