Little Goat Diner////Desserts - I'm not much if a dessert person, but maybe it's because I haven't been eating these desserts. Their Elvis cake is a banana bread cake with a peanut butter creme with caramelized bacon bits!!! Seriously, need I say more?!  The Turtle Pie and Golden Graham Cake  - equally as delicious. Even if you can't save room for dessert, take some to go because you won't regret it. If I recommend a dessert, it must be good because I never want dessert
