Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Very classy old school feel to this restaurant and bar. Â Service was great! A lot of younger service members making the experience laid back and casual. Food here is exceptional! Everything we tried was amazing from the home made sourdough bread to the Chicago cut rib eye! I've dined at some of the best steakhouses in America and Babette's definitely holds its own as one of my new favorites! The steak frites was spot on!
