The Purple Pig////We started of with the pork tongue with macaroni salad. You can skip this one. It was good but tasted similar to Bakkwa (Chinese pork jerky). The fried pig's ear with crispy kale and egg was amazing. We also had broccoli with lemon vinaigrette (good veggie option, but not as interesting as other dishes). The bone marrow was very generous (we got 2 big bones and 6 slices of toast). Very rich. The octopus tentacle entree was great (tender) but we were quite full already.
