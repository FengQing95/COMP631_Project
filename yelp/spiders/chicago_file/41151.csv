Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Wonderful service, unpretentious setting, delicious food. I had the lobster paella, which was flavorful, fresh, and uncomplicated. warning Â - - paella dishes can take 30 minutes to prepare, so if that's all you're getting (like me), you'll have a wait. Worth it, though. The tapas here are reliably delicious and artfully presented. My meal, with tax and tip, came to $38.
