Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Hands down this is the best breakfast place in the city! There is usually a long wait if you go 9am or later. I like getting there as soon as they open in order to avoid extensive wait times. Although wait time can be long, it's worth it. Grab a cup of coffee from the Intelligensia cafe inside the restaurant while you wait. Their specialty pancakes (Oreo S'mores, Cinnamon Rolls, etc) are to die for! Their service is usually pretty good too.
