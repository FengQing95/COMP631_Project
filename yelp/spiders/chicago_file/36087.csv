Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Now on to the food, the shrimp app was great, goat cheese was meh. For my entr√©e I got the NY Strip and bone marrow on the side. The NY strip was the best I've had in Chicago (I've had one at pretty much every reputable steakhouse here). The tenderness and flavor were incomparable. My gf got the ribeye and it had a really unique, almost lamb like, flavor. Then there was the CORN! You know that scene in step-brothers were Dale describes Brennan's voice as. Combo of Jesus and Fergie? Well that's pretty much the best way to describe this too.
