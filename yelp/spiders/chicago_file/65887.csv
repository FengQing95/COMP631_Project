Smoque BBQ////With that being said the ribs were decent 3,/5,  and my wife had chopped brisket sandwich 4/5.  I think i would prefer the sliced brisket.   For my sides i did fries and mac and cheese, it automatically comes with Coleslaw.  The mac and cheese is below average and the coleslaw i wasn't a fan of, i prefer more of creamy slaw,  this was dryer.  The fries were fresh cut i liked them. 4/5 I also tried the Texas Sausage it was good 4/5.  Reminds me of a eckridge sausage, but smoked to perfection. Don't live close so i probably won't be back.
