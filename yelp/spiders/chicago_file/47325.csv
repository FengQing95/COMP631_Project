Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My friend and I were shopping in Lincoln Park, and decided to stop here for a late lunch because I'd heard great things about the food from multiple people. The restaurant was still full at around 2-3pm, so they offered to seat us at the bar. BIGGEST MISTAKE. Since the bar is near the exit of the kitchen, separated from the main dining area, service was extremely slow. From the beginning, we had to flag down the busboys to alert the waiter to even give us our menus. This continued throughout our meal, and we barely ever saw our waiter unless he was placing the dish on our table.
