Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Had this place at 4 starts for the deep-dish because I really enjoyed it.  It was some of the best deep dish I've had here in Chicago.  Went back to try the thin crust and that's where the 3 stars comes in.  The thin crust was disappointing, the crust tasted like it was just heated up frozen pizza and the pizza itself feel apart.  Overall, get the deep dish and avoid the thin crust
