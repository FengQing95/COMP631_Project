Art Institute of Chicago////I can go on and on, even though I was only there for an hour. But this museum is a must for everyone traveling to Chicago or if you just love the art. Yes, I'll be back, and yes I'll dedicate more time and plan ahead and check out the American Modern Art, Arms and Armor, Ancient Egypt and much much more. And heck...you can't beat FREE...boo yah!!!
