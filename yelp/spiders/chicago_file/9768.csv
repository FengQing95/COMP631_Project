Art Institute of Chicago////Even though I was enthralled, my tummy rumbled and I hit the Garden Caf√©. Many options looked delish, but I chose the Hummus Plate and ate a Snickers. After I finished my exquisite meal, I hit the first floor and Gift Shop. I bought many cards and one book. I'm seriously compelled to buy a membership to the Institute.
