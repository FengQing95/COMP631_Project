Art Institute of Chicago////We had a wonderful time at the Art institute! We spent about 3 hours there Â plus 30 min in the gift shop. There was a bit of a line for tickets so I suggest buying online if you can. Keep in mind we kept a good pace going through the museum but we managed to cover the little rooms, some of the impressionist collection, American art and some of the modern art in the modern wing. I think we really got a nice feel for the collections and the museum. It's a really beautiful museum with lots of exceptional collections!
