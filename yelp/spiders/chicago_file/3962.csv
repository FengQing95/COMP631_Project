The Purple Pig////Lamb ribs - This was the least favorite of the dishes. Maybe I just prefer pork over lamb. The texture was definitely there. The meat was falling off the bone and had a nice layer of fattiness. The sauce was just a little too sweet and overpowering for me. It was like a really bold barbecue sauce slathered all over the ribs.
