Art Institute of Chicago////What is there to say that hasn't been said?  The Art Institute is truly a Chicago treasure.  A world-class art museum.  Every time I come here, I think to myself that I need to come more often.  The $18 admission and life in general always seem to get in the way.  However, when the museum offered Free February, I knew I had to make an effort to go.  And I did.
