Smoque BBQ////Girlfriend and I drove up the highway for smoked meat on Sunday, from one of Chicago's most popular restaurants. I dropped off the dry cleaning and navigated the Kennedy while she placed the order by phone. When we arrived at Smoque, I parked outside. It was about 5PM and there was a line way out the door. I asked the busser how to deal with the line- he directed me right in to the register. Minutes later we were on the Irving Park road to Portage Park for some BBQ in the grass.
