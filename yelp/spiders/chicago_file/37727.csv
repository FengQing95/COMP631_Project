Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As mentioned, Benjamin, is an amazing person to help your table.  Honestly, everywhere we looked... the staff here is on point.  A fork fell on the floor, 2 seconds later IN THE DARK, the staff is picking it up and delivering a new one.  The service captain is folding napkins for those who went away from the table.  You never have a minute wait after you cross your fork and knives on the plate.  Everything is timed perfectly to make you think everything is effortless.  Benjamin was able to help us pick several dishes that were the best Bavette had to offer and still save room for the amazing dessert (more on that later).  I really appreciated this level of service... last time I had something similar to this was at a Michelin starred restaurant in Budapest.
