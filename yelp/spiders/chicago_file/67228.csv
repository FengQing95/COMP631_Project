Little Goat Diner////Pricing is, obviously, not what it is at your hometown diner (everything a la carte, sandwiches and burgers $10-$12, sides $5-$8, desserts $6-$9), but for the quality of the food, it's pretty much a steal. Service is very attentive and personal; just as is the case across the street, Little Goat does a good job hiring people you'd actually want to hang out with, including (and in our case especially) the busboys. Also, they brought Stephanie by our table, which was awesome (even if I managed to make a fool out of myself due to intense star-struckness). Ambiance is modern but thoroughly inviting; it was very difficult to convince everyone to leave. With the caveat that I'm seeing this through intensely rose colored glasses, I must say that I found Little Goat to be among the happiest places on Earth. I'll be back religiously!
