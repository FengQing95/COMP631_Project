Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was so excited to visit for my first slice of deep dish, but unfortunately chose Saturday night and was pretty well forgotten by waitstaff. We were a table of 4 and were there 2+ hours for salad and classic pie (which was not hot when it arrived). After waiting for our bill for 30+ mins I approached the manager on duty and was given prompt service. Unfortunate that our server was terrible, but pizza was also less than desirable. Total bummer.
