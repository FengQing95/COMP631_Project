The Purple Pig////The menu is varied and Iggies swarm in for the bone marrow and pig ears. Was not feeling either so I tried other dishes.  The success for me was in the tuna tartare--the distinctive crown functioned as cracker to scoop the delicious fish.  The squid ink pasta was good if a bit salty.  Dessert was fine also.
