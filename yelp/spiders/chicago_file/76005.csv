Little Goat Diner////We finally had the chance to stop in Little Goat Diner for lunch on Saturday. The place was bustling. We checked in around 11:30 and the host said there was a 45 minute wait. The good news is they do have a texting system that will text you when your table is ready. Also the bakery/bar/cafe is next door if you want to grab a quick drink while you wait which is what we did. The wife had a Bloody Mary and I had a coffee and piece of the white chocolate Rosemary bread which was amazing. After waiting about 35 minutes we were seated in a nice cozy table for two in the center of the restaurant. They definitely designed this place for maximizing space and efficiency. The interior has a nice contemporary design. Love the skylight in the center of the place which allows a ton of natural light.
