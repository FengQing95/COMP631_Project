Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The waitstaff was AMAZING.  We had two servers.  One guy welcomed me into the private dining room and was so pleasant and accommodating.  Sangria, coffee and Orange Juice were served.  Both servers were efficient and attentive all through our party from 11-2.  Really great and refreshing.
