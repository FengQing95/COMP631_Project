Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We started off with sangria which was delectable! We then ordered a wide variety of tapas such as: bacon wrapped dates, empanadas, patatas bravas, scallops, salmon, and skewered chicken and chorizo skewers. Everything was delicious; however, the stars of the night were the patatas bravas and the scallops! I mean, who doesn't love potatoes?However, the aioli they had it with was a delicious, zesty tomato aioli which had me dunking each piece of potato in the sauce! The scallops were cooked to perfection and were juicy and delectable! ALSO BONUS: free dessert with check in on yelp! We made the most of it with caramelized bananas w/ vanilla ice cream!
