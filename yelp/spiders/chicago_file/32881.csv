Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Beautiful rustic and romantic ambiance. Service was excellent and the food was delicious. I started with the smoked whitefish Caesar salad which was awesome. The lamb chops were good although not the best I've had. We ordered a side of the sweet potato with butter and brown sugar. Well at least the sweet potato is good for you. It was heavenly.
