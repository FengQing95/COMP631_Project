Smoque BBQ////Being a Texan, I'd have to say that Smoque BBQ is one of the best I've places I've ever been to.  The meat was moist and great.  I had the brisket and rib plate with macaroni cheese and beans.  Although I like to go to Barbeque joints to enjoy their meat and the occasional side dish that will most likely hit or miss, this place got it all right.. actually their sides shot my opinion about this place through the roof.  Seriously though, that Mac n cheese was ,, was,, freaking good. I'll be definitely going back when I visit the Windy City again.
