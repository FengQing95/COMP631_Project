Smoque BBQ////I went here because of all the reviews but did not find it to be anything special. We got there right when it opened which is good bc within twenty minutes of eating the place was packed! I got pulled pork which had a lot of smoky flavor which was nice but I like my pulled pork with a lot of BBQ sauce and this didn't have much. Their sauce also wasn't very sweet which is how I prefer it. The portion sizes were good for the price. The service was also very good and they do a good job of clearing tables quickly to accommodate all the customers.
