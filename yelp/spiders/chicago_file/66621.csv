Little Goat Diner////When I went back, I decided to change it up and order breakfast.  The french toast is out of this world.  Everyone at the table was eating off of my plate.  The fried pickle sammie that my friend had was alright, but nothing to get excited about.  My other friend's pork belly pancake was pretty good according to him.  And what did we get for dessert?  Obviously the choco taco again!
