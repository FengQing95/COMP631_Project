The Purple Pig////This place is for sharing! We ordered several plates : tuna tartare, burrata, pork belly, pork shoulder, and cauliflower. We enjoyed everything we ordered but will say that the plates were very small portions and not "big" like they claim. The burrata was my favorite!! Would come back for that any day!
