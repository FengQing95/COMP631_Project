Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Long story short, hubby, kid and I knew going in we'd need to wait around 45 minutes for our pizza.  But then an hour went by.  Then 15 more minutes, and still, no food.  We finally flagged down our server who mumbled something about the kitchen being backed up.  Another 20 minutes or so and we'd pretty much had it.  Hubby insisted we speak to a manager who finally got to the bottom of things.  Our server apparently had forgotten to put in our order.  Then when she finally remembered, she dropped our finished pies on the floor. She neglected to share any of this and kept trying fake us out.
