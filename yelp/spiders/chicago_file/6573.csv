The Purple Pig////Crispy Pig's Ear ($19): If you're grossed out by ears, it's okay. it's cut into small strips and fried, so you wouldn't even know what it's made of. basically tastes like anything else that's been fried. pretty good, but also too salty. I like the idea of the fried kale and pickled banana peppers, but the saltiness just wasn't doing it for me. This was way too expensive to be worth it.
