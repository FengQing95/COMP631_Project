Smoque BBQ////The St.Louis style ribs were perfect in taste, texture and aroma. While I was waiting for them to cool off a little that great smoky smell was wafting right up off the plate. I got the half slab which was a nice portion, but I easily could have handled the full. Each of the sides I tried was right-on and delicious. And not just one-dimensional, same-as-everywhere-else conformity. The mac and cheese was loose, creamy and topped with a little bit of breadcrumbs. The beans were a balance of sweet and tangy, and the slaw was fresh and nice and vinegary-sweet. Their Memphis BBQ sauce was outstanding and I ordered a chopped beef-brisket sandwich to go, which lasted a few miles before I pulled over into a parking lot to devour it. A friendly, efficient wait staff (though the girl at the counter could stand to belt out those order numbers a little louder). Prices are reasonable. Parking a little challenging. Only criticism is that the dining-area temperature was too cold (on an already chilly night)
