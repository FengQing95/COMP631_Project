Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////OMG I just found my favorite place to eat in Chicago! The atmosphere is very romantic. The staff extremely nice. The food was amazing! We ordered the 10 oz filet mignon which practically melted in my mouth. We also ordered the beef stroganoff. I'm not a pasta person but this was amazing!!! We also order the pomes frites and the corn! The corn dish was my favorite!!! When I finished eating it my only wish was that I turn invisible so I could lick the plate. They bring bread out first with butter. Even the butter was amazing. After each dish the busboy cleans of the table and arranges new silver wear in the most graceful and art like way. I wanted to applaud. Â We had the lemon pie with French press coffee for dessert and it was also amazing. I can't wait to come back!!!!
