Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This was my first time at a tapas restaurant. Went here with a group of 4 on a Friday night.  We enjoyed 3 different pitchers of sangria, and all 3 were great!  We ordered 10 hot tapas, Beef Medallions w/ bleu cheese, and chicken and chorizo skewers were the standouts to me. I wasn't disappointed by any.  Food arrives at a good pace, allows you to really enjoy everything you eat. I would recommend this place to anyone and I will be back!
