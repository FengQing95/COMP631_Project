Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We started off with an order of the oysters and shrimp cocktail. The oysters were nice big oysters that were super fresh. The shrimp were nice big plump shrimp cooked to perfection. We then split the Roasted Tomato and bacon salad and wow, was this good. We received 3 huge pieces of tomatoes, roasted with 2 thick slabs of bacon on top. The mixture of the fatty bacon with the ripe tomatoes was amazing. For our mains, I had the duchess filet cooked absolutely perfectly, the meat almost melted in my mouth. He had the Ribeye and thought it was cooked to his liking and was excellent. We split the Elote Corn - mus have and the mashed potatoes, both were amazing.
