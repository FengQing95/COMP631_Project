Smoque BBQ////Wow was this good! Came by on a Friday about 12:15 - there is a line to order but it goes pretty fast and there are people asking if your going to eat in will find you a table - we had no problem getting a table outside. I went for the 1/2 & 1/2 - pork and beef. They both were so good! I got the combo that comes with cole slaw and choice of side. The slaw was VERY good - it was vinegar based with slivers of purple onion. I opted for the BBQ beans-amazing!
