Art Institute of Chicago////I was here in October, right before the Chicago Marathon on a business trip, accompanying my boyfriend. The ticket was priced right at $18, and I think I spend 6 hours here. I was blown away by the vast and diverse collection of art and history in one location. There were some exhibits that were not yet in play, but I was able to sneak a peek of some of the soon to be unveiled pieces in the Greek history section.
