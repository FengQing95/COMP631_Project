Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza here is obviously classic and pretty damn good. Can't go wrong with this place. This particular location is a bit smaller. I keep going back and forth between whether I prefer Lou's or Giordano's. It's a tough decision but I think I might slightly prefer Giordanos. Maybe it's the sauce or maybe it's the crust. I don't know. Either way both of these places are delicious. Enjoy it.
