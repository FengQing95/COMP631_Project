Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Food as delicious even if my filet was slightly over cooked for a medium.  I'm sure they would have replaced it if I said something.   The salmon tartar was very good and ceviche like.  Prices are rich but worth it once in awhile. Bathroom situation is odd as there is only one room per sex.  Expect to stand around looking odd outside waiting. Would come back to try different menu items.
