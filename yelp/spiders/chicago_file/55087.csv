Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food here is a solid 3.5 stars - it's tasty, well made and mostly authentic to Spanish tapas.  Spain being one of my favorite countries in the world and having visited it many times I can definitely (and unsurprisingly) say that there are better tapas out there but I don't want to discredit the good food that they do produce here - it's just not mind blowing amazing to me.  Oh and critically for a Spanish restaurant their olive oil is really quite good!!!
