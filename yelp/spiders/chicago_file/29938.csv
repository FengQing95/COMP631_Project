Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Deep dish pizza is a must when you are in Chicago, and Lou Malnati's is hands-down my favorite! My family used to go more often in the suburbs but the long wait time at the city locations make deep dish pizza primarily a "when out-of-town friends are visiting" treat. And because visitors usually come on weekends, we found ourselves in an hour-long wait on a Friday evening. It's not too bad since we anticipated this, but it's hard watching and smelling the yummy pizza pass you by.
