Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Amazing food! I usually get my steaks well done.  I tried it medium rare this time because we shared with our table. LIFE CHANGING! I am never getting well done steak again.  The squash was my absolute favorite, next to the rib tip stroganoff.  I also tried the froi gras (my first time)-delicious. French fries were even heavenly! The only dish I wasnt a fan of was the fried chicken or the elote style corn. I prefer my family recipes . Everything else was sooo good, shellfish tower.. Down to the bread, can't wait to go back!
