Little Goat Diner////Went here for lunch. It's like Girl and The Goat had a baby with a diner. Great food and service. The Reuben was really good and the sweet corn side was one of those dishes I couldn't stop taking a bite of. Our server was very well versed with the menu and offered great suggestion.
