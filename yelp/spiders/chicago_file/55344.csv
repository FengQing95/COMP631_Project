Smoque BBQ////It's 5pm where to go for sime great BBQ? Smoque that's where. It's our first time here and it was amazing. 1st street parking is a must. Park on Pulaski if possible. 2nd when you walk in and not sure what to order? No problem the owner is more than happy to meet and greet you at the door and help you pick out something you'll love to eat. The food well unless you try it for yourself I cant explain it except WOW. Definitely one of the best places in Chicago if the Best for BBQ.
