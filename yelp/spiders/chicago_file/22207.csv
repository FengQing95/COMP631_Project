Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Major let down. We were told we'd be seated in 25 mins but that we should order our pizza ahead with the cashier. We placed our order ahead. It took 45 mins before we were sat at our table. The pizza came out with our drinks 20 minutes later. Our pizza wasn't fresh. It was room temperature and it had clearly been reheated, because it was sitting out so long. I would have preferred to wait longer and have a fresh pizza. This restaurant prefers quantity of guests before quality of pizza. The service was also very slow. I don't recommend this place nor do I recommend ordering ahead if you want a fresh pizza.
