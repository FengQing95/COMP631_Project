Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////On to the meal... this time around, we explored a few new dishes & I absolutely loved the #25 endive salad with membrillo.  This was my first time experiencing such a delightful ingredient.  I actually did research on membrillo to find out more it and I suggest for anyone to taste this sweet treat that resembles ahi tuna but tastes nothing of the sort!  The short rib on the pintxo menu was out of this world.  I had to reorder the beef tenderloin based on my own review & glad I did- although next time I want to try the rioja short rib tapa since I loved the pintxo so much.  I really wanted to order the grilled calamari but my guest doesn't do much seafood, so I gave in to her omelette request again (tasty).  I was hoping for the bread pudding I had last time too but the dessert selection had changed. We tried a few and out of the ones we ordered, I liked the marcona tart the best.
