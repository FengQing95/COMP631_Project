Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is definitely one of the best of the 2019 restaurant week! Some of the recommendations include, garlic shrimp, squid legs with spicy tomato sauce, hanger steak, Â and the house charcuterie plate (the ham really was as delicious as the iberco ham I has in Spain). The server recommended two to three tapas plates per person but it was a little too much in my opinion. For our party of three, we ordered one restaurant week set, four extra tapas and half a pitcher of sangria and we almost couldn't walk out of the restaurant . The vibe of this place was very nice; perfect for a bday celebration or a date night.
