Art Institute of Chicago////If you plan on going here, and you should, be sure to save plenty of time because there is so much to see and it would be a shame to rush this great museum. the Jackson Pollack exhibit was absolutely magical. I can't even describe all of the fantastic art and exhibits to see. I spent hours here and could've spent more. There is a restaurant in the museum (NOT cheap) but was incredible. I would absolutely recommend it. Sit by the window and you can watch the trains go by which I loved because it contrasted the clean dining room and perfectly placed food with a great view of something gritty and still beautiful.
