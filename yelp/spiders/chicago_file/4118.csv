The Purple Pig////We got pork shoulder, Brussels sprouts, salmon and bone marrow. Pork shoulder was really good, amazing texture and flavor. Grilled sprouts were tasty, feel like you're eating light chips flavors like Brussels sprouts. Salmon was really well cooked and prepared, bone marrow was underwhelming.
