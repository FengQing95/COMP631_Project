Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I swear I never liked eating pizza until I had a slice from here! I honestly think it's WAY better than Giordano's and I tell my friends that when they visit. This location gets crowded fast and early, so you might want to prepare to wait a little by ordering some drinks or look through and drool all over the menu. I'd advise to try the classic if it's your first time to see if you like it, but no harm in ordering more!
