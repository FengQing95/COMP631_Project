Little Goat Diner////I'd heard of its big sister Girl & The Goat (though hadn't been), but wasn't too familiar with this place. I also didn't realize reservations were so hard to come by as we simply walked in and were seated 10 minutes later. Granted, it was late afternoon on a weekday so not exactly a prime hour like brunch.
