Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I was going to round up to 4 stars, but once I started reviewing my last visit, I realized that there were quite a few things that disappointed.  I have liked going here because the prices are pretty reasonable, and I truly love the tapas style of dining.  But,. perhaps I'll go elsewhere next time.
