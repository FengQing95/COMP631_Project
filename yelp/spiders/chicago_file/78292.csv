Little Goat Diner////We made an eaaaaarly breakfast res. (7:30!) wanting to get the day going and jam pack as much Chicago into our Saturday as possible. We were running a little late...7:30 on a Saturday might've been a little ambitious...and the host was super friendly both over the phone and once we arrived. Our server was also great.
