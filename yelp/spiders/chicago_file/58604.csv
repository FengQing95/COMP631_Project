Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value!
