Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////YUM. Ok, I have to admit I was a little hesitant to try the deep dish style pizza being from New York and living off of thin crust, but I was pleasantly surprised - it was better than I thought. Four of us popped in around 6:30 on a Thursday and there was a 25 minute wait (it actually was 25 and not like, one hour). We were told to order the pizza specifically at the front before we sat down. We opted for the Chicago classic and the Lou (there were four of us and we ordered two mediums - perfect amount). We also started with the calamari which was shockingly good. The pizza was awesome. Our friends who live in Chicago said that this was a "thinner" deep dish which I liked. Of the two pies, I preferred the Chicago classic. The sausage was a nice touch and the pie itself was full of flavor. Overall, I was really impressed. As for the service, our waiter was great, and he called me out for not already having a beer in front of me when we got to the table, which I can appreciate.
