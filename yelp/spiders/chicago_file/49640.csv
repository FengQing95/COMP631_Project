Smoque BBQ////If you're a fan of simple, no fuss food, and can appreciate pork shoulder or a brisket that has been smoked all day, then this place is DEFINITELY for you. Smoque is a no frills kind of place, and you can tell the moment you walk up (I'd say walk in, but chances of not standing in a line out the door are slim to none). Everything I had there was delicious, including the fries, which I usually try to avoid at places, but standing in line and watching people eat them convinced me otherwise. Smoque is earnest, straightforward Texas BBQ. My only REAL gripe about this place is the wait, but I suppose there is nothing that can be done about it. The product is amazing, and people will wait in line to experience it. I'd like to see outdoor seating maybe? But I guess it would steal from the line space?
