Art Institute of Chicago////I want to give a shout out not only to the art, but to the officers. These are the uniformed individuals who help protect the art, and are usually not very friendly and say little other than to tell you to step away from the painting or that photography is not allowed. At The Art Institue of Chicago, they are SO nice. My husband and I interacted with approximately six in various parts of the museum and they all acted like gracious hosts who wanted to make sure you had what you needed. Their direction-giving was perfect, their smiles heart-warming, their good natures infectious. I spoke to one on our way out, Derail Howery, to ask what his job title was because I wanted to make sure I used the correct one in writing this review. He again demonstrated what the others had: real friendliness and warmth. I think the Art Institute is the Nordstrom of Museums in terms of hiring truly nice people. And it does enhance the experience.
