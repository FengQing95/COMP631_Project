Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Aside from the great food and drinks, the service was excellent. Went with a friend and ended up waiting a little bit longer than usual for a service. Once they realized we had been waiting they went above and beyond to make it up to us. They were very attentive the rest of our visit, offered free dessert, and ended up compensating for our entire meal (which was delicious). The manager came up to talk with us and make sure everything was ok. I can tell this restaurant places importance on their guests and service. I would definitely visit again.
