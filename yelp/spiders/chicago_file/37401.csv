Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Another stop on the Hogsalt super highway! Man this place is good! Was recommended this place by a foodie coworker and said we couldn't go wrong for a romantic dinner here. Bavette's did not disappoint. We ordered a nice merlot and enjoyed the atmosphere before putting in our order. It was busy-which is to be expected but the lighting a decor make it feel cozy and intimate. We ordered the crab cake to start and loved it. Had to flip a coin to decide between short rib stroganoff or a filet. I had reservations about ordering stroganoff despite the things I heard of this dish. I ended up ordering it and I am so glad I did. Best dish I've had in a while! The noodles were cooked perfect, the creamy sauce and tender beef short ribs. Out of this world good! My husband ordered the petite filet and it was cooked to perfection! I'd eat at Bavette's once a week if I could get in!
