Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My only culinary goal on my first trip to Chicago was deep dish pizza.  MAN, this place did NOT disappoint one iota.  The concierge at our hotel (the Westin) recommended it as it was 4 blocks away & apparently receives lots of awards for best pizza in the city, so that's all the convincing we needed.
