Little Goat Diner////Ordered the French toast with fried chicken ($16) and added a side order of hash browns ($5) and a glass of beer ($7) :) the beer selection was awesome & I really enjoyed the beer I got! But the French toast was just okay :/ doesn't come close to being one of the best that I've ever tried ! Hash Browns were good but were pretty oily and heavy. I'm not very impressed with this place!
