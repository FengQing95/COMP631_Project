Smoque BBQ////sides? who cares its just another after thought! someone told me the mac n cheeses was awesome. i thought it was bland! the peach cobbler was OK... kinda tasted like apples. Â the fries were OK. needed salt. the cold slaw is more like cabbage and red onion with vinegar. but if you wanna call it slaw OK!
