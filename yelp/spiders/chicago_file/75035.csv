Little Goat Diner////Out came my veggie loco moco and his bulls eye French toast. I tried a piece of his without the chicken and omg, it's amazing. You get sucker-punched with sweet maple syrup, strawberries, then saltiness from the egg inside takes over. Very, very good. My loco was just what I was craving, comforting carbs and eggs. The portion was massive and I took 1/2 home. I scoped out their pancakes and Mac and cheese which look equally amazing.
