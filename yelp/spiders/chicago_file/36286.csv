Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Came here a few months ago and ordered the foie gras, a red and the chocolate pie.  I contemplated getting the bone-in ribeye and didn't, and I've regretted it ever since.  Everything else was really good (the pie was great), and the interior (especially downstairs) was beautiful and what a "place for adults" in a major city should look like.  Employees really seem to enjoy working there, as was the case with the bartender of Gilt Bar I talked to that same night.  Also, one guy at Bavettes reminded me of "Badger" (Jessie's friend in "Breaking Bad"), but I mean that in a good way.
