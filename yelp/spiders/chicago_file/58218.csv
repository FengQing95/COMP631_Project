Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We waited for at least half an hour by the bar, and then went to go check in with the hostess regarding our seats as we had expected to be seated closer to the time of our reservation. I was happy to wait as I wasn't in a hurry, but would have definitely been frustrated by this if I were on a tight schedule that night. It didn't feel as though a reservation helped us secure a table for the time that we had intended to eat around.
