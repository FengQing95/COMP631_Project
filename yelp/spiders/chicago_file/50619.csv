Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The first time I came I had a set menu already set up, but I recently returned and did most of the ordering. The octopus was delicious, as was the shrimp and sausages. The paella was the only thing I didn't love, because it was a seafood paella with not much seafood. Was still great though! I really liked the spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms.
