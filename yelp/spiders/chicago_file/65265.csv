Smoque BBQ////This BBQ is out of this world, shall we start with the brisket. It literally melts in your mouth. Every single piece had a delicious strip of fat running along the edge. NEXT the pulled pork! BOYS this is holy. Cover it in the Memphis style sauce  and  you might as well be havin a convo with Jesus. NEXT THE RIBS!!! This... This right here.... If you get nothing else get the St. Louis style ribs. They are not only perfect but they are even higher then heavenly. They are magical. Now please, stop reading this review get your self a Lyft, and munch munch!
