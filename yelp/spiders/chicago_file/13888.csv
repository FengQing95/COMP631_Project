Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Wow, wow, wow ... my first experience with a true deep dish Chicago pizza.  Full disclosure, I had a personal pizza, so missed some of the great out of the pan sliced up in front of you presentation.  That being said, a couple of beers and the sausage pizza was an incredible lunch.  They took our order and we waited about 10 minutes for a table.  The 25-30 minute wait for a pie is real.  It gets a little tough seeing others eat this tremendous pie in front of you ... but worth the wait.  A must stop for visitors to Chi-town.
