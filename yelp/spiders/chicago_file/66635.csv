Little Goat Diner////One of my favorite brunch or dinner places in the city, and one that I take my out of town guests after I pick them up from the airport. It's a good restaurant to start them off with - the chili goat cheese fries are delicious and I'm a fan of "breakfast for dinner" options (bullseye french toast!). Getting a table is never as difficult as Girl and the Goat. My average wait time has been either seated right away or less than 20 minutes. Service is friendly and they have good suggestions for the out of towners.
