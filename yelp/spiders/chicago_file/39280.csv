Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Did I mention this was my first encounter with bone-in dry aged rib-eye? I took a slice at the rib-eye and allowed the unadorned beef to rest on my tongue for a moment to let the flavor sink in. Oh my, was that a tender and sexy beast crisped with steak salt. Never mind the b√©arnaise, I will just have my rib-eye naked.
