Little Goat Diner////Everything was great but the food lacked perfection. I ordered the drowned omelet which was a daily special. You expect omelets to be large and loaded with food. Mine was just scrambled eggs wrapped and placed in a broth with brisket and fried onions placed on top. Nothing was cooked with the eggs, just placed on top. Weak and sad. My husband ordered this little went piggy went to China. So salty!!!! I think it was the soy sauce that gave it the saltiness. I couldn't enjoy the first bite or ask for a second. My husband likes salty and he even said it was too salty. My son ordered the hammie sammie off the kid's menu. Another sad presentation. It was just white bread with ham and havarti cheese inside. No condiments. Not even something to keep the sandwich together. Ham was in small pieces. Picked up the sandwich with their small hands and everything falls out. The hot crab dip was just ok. No bits of crab. Just taste like flavored cream cheese. Food needs improvement but service was great. Lots of options on the menu.
