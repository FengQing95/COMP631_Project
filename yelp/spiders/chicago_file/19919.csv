Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This pizza was AMAZING. Oh my gosh, the butter crust MAKES this pizza what it is...so. damn. good. Me and my husband just visited Chicago and stopped here on a food tour we were attending with Chicago Food Planet. This was our FIRST stop and it was one of my favorite places! We just had the cheese version and only had one slice, but net time we make it back to Chicago, I would love to come back and try a pepperoni or sausage. I haven't tried any other deep dish pizza places in Chicago, but if you went here you will NOT be disappointed!
