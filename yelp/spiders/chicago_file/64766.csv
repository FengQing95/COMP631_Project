Smoque BBQ////If you love bbq, you have to check this place out! You'll smell the delicious goodness just walking by. Be prepared for a long wait if you come at night, but on a Sunday afternoon, there was no wait. When you head in, you order at the register and then someone directs you to a table. The food comes out fairly quickly, and it's great. We ordered a full slab of ribs (22.95) and since we were indecisive about which type we wanted, baby back or St. Louis. Both were delicious, but I prefer the baby back ribs since the St. Louis is fattier. None fall off the bone since they are smoked. For our two sides, we chose the Mac and cheese, which I would recommend, and the chili, which I would not. It was a little too watery. We also ordered a platter of pulled pork a la carte (8.45). You should definitely get this- it's pretty much perfect.
