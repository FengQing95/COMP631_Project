Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Many reviews noted the long wait time for the pizza. It's a deep dish pizza so it takes longer to bake. They might have tried to prep the pie, but still the pizza is quite thick and hence longer time in the oven. To wait less, order your pizza right after you put your name down in the waiting list. That way, you would only wait for 15mins or so for your pizza. You can order other items on the menu when you get and sit at your table.
