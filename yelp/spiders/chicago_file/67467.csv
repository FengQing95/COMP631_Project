Little Goat Diner////I squeezed the burger down to a manageable thickness and began eating.  As I shamelessly devoured the burger, my higher brain functions slowly shut down and my eyes glazed over with a Neanderthal bliss.  The taste of beef, pork, onion rings, and a medley of other complex flavors were intoxicating and completely overwhelming to my lizard brain.  But I didn't care.  In the span of thirty-seconds I had gone from a college-educated professional to a knuckle-dragging caveman whose sole purpose in life was to devour the next 300-calorie mouthful of orgasmaburger.
