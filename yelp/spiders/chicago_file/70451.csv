Little Goat Diner////I had the Patty Melt with goat. It was DELICIOUS!!! I usually don't like patty melts but something about this was just calling my name. The pretzel rye was great! It took out some of the ryenss, if that makes sense. The carmalized onions and cheese were perfectly melted together. It was a great choice!
