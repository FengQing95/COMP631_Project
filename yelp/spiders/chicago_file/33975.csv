Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We were seated on the main floor in a semi circular booth in the back, which was cozy and semi private while giving us great views of the bar. Â Our waiter was socially awkward and was fond of calling me "dear" in the most condescending of tones, but I stopped caring once I had a martini in hand.
