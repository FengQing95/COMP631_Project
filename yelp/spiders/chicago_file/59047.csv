Smoque BBQ////The bad: The brisket was over cooked and didn't have much flavor. I have seen other post describe it as pot roast like and I would have to agree. Not much smoke flavor, bark was no where close to what was on the ribs. Â Overall the brisket wasn't horrible, it just wasn't what I expect brisket to be. The pulled pork was not very smokey and didn't have much flavor at all. The texture reminded me of tuna fish. The bun was pretty boring too. There was really nothing special about the sandwich at all. As for the sauces, they are not even worth mentioning.
