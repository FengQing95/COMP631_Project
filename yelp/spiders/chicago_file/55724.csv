Smoque BBQ////We asked him about the brisket vs. chopped, he explained the difference so we could decide based on what we liked. When our food arrived, he brought over a sample of the chopped brisket (we ordered a "taste" of the regular brisket) so we could try them both. I could go on and on, it was just a great overall experience.
