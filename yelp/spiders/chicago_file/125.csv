Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I'm appauled that customers have to be treated like this; this is a classic case of profiling higher class customers over everyone else.  Why are 2nd class/casual dressed folks rushed out ?  There is no signage that a jacket/executive dress is required.  My friends were upset we were treated this way, as it wasn't a great impression on the great tourism chicago has to offer.
