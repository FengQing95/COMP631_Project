Little Goat Diner////Last night I ordered the tuna melt. When it was placed in front of me, it bore no resemblance to a sandwich. Bottom up: plate, one (??) slice of good country white bread, very runny albacore tuna salad, white "cheese sauce" and piled on top with greens, some hard boiled egg slices, and cherry tomatoes.
