Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We also got the short rib with mashed potatoes, sirloin with spinach, bacon wrapped dates, and spicy potatoes. The short was incredible... it melted in your mouth and had wonderful flavors. It tasted like the pot roast that you wished your mom made. The sirloin was very good, and I was surprised at the good hunk of meat you get for $8. I was excited for the dates after reading reviews, but I wasn't as impressed. Bacon = yum, but the dates were so sugary. It tasted like candy wrapped in bacon. It was good and I see how other people love it, but I prefer more savory flavors. The potatoes were good, golden brown with just a bit of spice and come with a creamy tomato aioli for dipping.
