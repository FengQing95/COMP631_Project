Au Cheval////I'm only giving 4 stars, because I didn't try the food. I have a feeling it's pretty good though. We went for a drink after eating at girl & the goat. The staff was nice, even though our server seemed a little spacey. The drinks were fantastic. The acoustics are amazing. Its worth a trip just to hear what it sounds like. I would definitely go here all the time if I lived closer.
