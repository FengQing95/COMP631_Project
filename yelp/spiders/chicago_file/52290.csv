Smoque BBQ////I, too, don't have a lot else to add to what has already been said.  My husband and I love this place.  We usually stick to the same thing, although I'm realizing after dining in that I REALLY need to try some of the delicious looking ribs and french fries that I saw.  I love the chopped brisket and pulled pork sandwiches, as well as their BBQ sauce, coleslaw, mac-n-cheese, corn bread, and peach cobbler.  I also appreciate that their sandwiches come in half portions, especially when ordering them with mac-n-cheese and coleslaw.
