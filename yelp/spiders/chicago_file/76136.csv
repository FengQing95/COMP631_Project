Little Goat Diner////The service was good and it was nice to see they even had a house beer, a nice and unexpected touch. It's a great place to come to if you're looking for flavor and a nice ambiance. Would highly recommend getting dropped off or public transit here as parking can be a nightmare / cost as much as a whole meal.
