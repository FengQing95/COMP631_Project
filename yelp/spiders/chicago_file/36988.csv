Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Service was wonderful. I think the negative experience we had in the past was a fluke because 2 out of 3 times we've gone, the service has been great. The waiter this time was outgoing and friendly, just what you'd expect from such a highly rated restaurant. He made wonderful suggestions on what to drink with dinner and even packed us some fresh hot bread with our leftovers.
