Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The best Tapas in the City! Because I am Latina I love Spanish and Mexican food and I am very picky, so I made my husband try just about every tapas place in the city and guess what my favorite it Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba by a land slide. There food is authentic, just like you would get in Barcelona, there sangria is so tasty and the atmosphere is very welcoming. They seem to always be busy sometimes makes the service a little slow but not all the time. You can see the Spanish culture as soon as you walk into the door. You've got to try this place out and they have valet parking a big plus.
