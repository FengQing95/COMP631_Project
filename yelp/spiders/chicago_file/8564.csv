Art Institute of Chicago////It has exhibits on everything from antiquities to modern era.  The museum is clean, air-conditioned (could be cooler), has helpful personnel, and had several clean toilet areas.  When I was there, it was not mobbed, and the visiting public was quiet and well-behaved. The room with medieval armor and weaponry is fascinating.  There is a large collection of impressionist art, and there are many famous pieces, e.g., Picasso, Monet, Magritte.  The Modern Wing is a bit tricky to get at, as is the high end restaurant inside, and it is easy to get lost if you are a first timer, even with the guide book, as there are long, swoop corridors.
