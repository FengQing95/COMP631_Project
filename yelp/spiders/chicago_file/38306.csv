Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For main dishes, I've tried the steaks, meatloaf, and fried chicken with gravy, and the chicken in particular is phenomenal. There are so many impressive and delicious-sounding options on the menu that it's hard to choose, and I'm sure you can't go wrong. I've seen the burger walk past many times and thought it looked really tasty. Might have to go with that one next time!
