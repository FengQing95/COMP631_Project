Smoque BBQ////I went on a Sunday afternoon ready to wait. Lucky me, I was ordering in just a couple of minutes! I got a half slab of baby back ribs, mac and cheese, fries, and coleslaw. My boyfriend got the chopped brisket sandwich, beans, and coleslaw. My ribs were absolutely perfect! Smoky bark, juicy meat, not too fatty. I dunked the pieces in the accompanying regular and spicy sauce.
