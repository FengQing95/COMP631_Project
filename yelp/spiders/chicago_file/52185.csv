Smoque BBQ////My fiance agreed to the idea of having lunch there and it was an amazing experience. The service is quick and you don't have to sit around waiting for your order to be served up. I ordered the brisket which was juicy and tender while my fiance settled for the pulled pork that was out of this world. We split a Mac and cheese that was perfect with coleslaw to match. The sauces are great and I enjoyed dipping my fries in them. Everything had delicious flavor and it the tight and cozy setting gave us an opportunity to chat with some fellow patrons.
