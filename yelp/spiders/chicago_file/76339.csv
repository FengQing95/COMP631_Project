Little Goat Diner////I would definitely recommend you make reservations. My party of 4 decided to take a chance with no reservation and were lucky enough to be seated outside within 5 minutes. Everything here is ordered a la carte, i.e if you want fries with your sandwich you have to order them separately. That being said for the price they charge for their menu items, the portions are small! I did enjoy my food but I highly doubt I will be back.
