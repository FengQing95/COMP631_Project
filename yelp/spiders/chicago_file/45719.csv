Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My waiter was either new or stoned -- I think it was the later because he was pretty freaking weird (and I like weird people, but I wasn't loving this dude). The pace was slow, the colors were light -- and I just wanted to freaking be outside the whole time I was in here. Oh well.
