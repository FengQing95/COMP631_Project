Art Institute of Chicago////I was here for about 3 hours last time and got to see about 1/3 of the museum.  They have a great collection of impressionist paintings.  I also got the see Chagall's windows which was pretty awesome as well.  They really have a lot to offer people who appreciate all different kinds of art.
