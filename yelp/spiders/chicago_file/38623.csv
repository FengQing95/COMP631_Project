Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Anyhow, we got seated and our waiter came by, hollered that he'd be right with us, and then left. I gotta tell you, he was talking a million miles a minute - almost like he had taken an adderall and chased it with a red bull before coming to work. "You want drinks? Oh you got drinks? ok cooll you ready to order?" It was entertaining, but kind of strange.
