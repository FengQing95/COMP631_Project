Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The not so good:  I ordered the brisket hash, which sounded delicious.  Unfortunately, the brisket itself was extremely chewy and I couldn't get past the second bite.  Up until that point, the service had been great, but the initial check-in after we received our meals didn't happen until almost 10 minutes from when they were served, so I had to wait a while to send the plate back.  To their credit, they quickly rushed me a different meal, which was very good (corn beef hash skillet).  The pancakes tasted good, but the "specialty" ingredients (one of us got the wild berry pancakes, one of us got the caramel apple pancakes) aren't actually incorporated into the batter itself - they're just placed on top of standard pancakes.  This is a head-scratcher, and is something I would expect at IHOP.  The omelet one of us ordered was dense and overcooked, with a hunk of cheese in the center instead of an even distribution.  The experience was pretty disappointing - probably the only restaurant I can say that for out of the dozen or so I visited during a four-day stay in Chicago.
