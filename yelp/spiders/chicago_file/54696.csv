Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Really really good food. I seriously loved everything I ate. Most memorable items: bacon wrapped dates, Â buttermilk chicken thighs, burrata with heirloom tomatoes. I got the red classic sangria and I normally hate sangria but this was delicious. I would say if they lowered their prices by 2.5% it would get a 5 Star rating.
