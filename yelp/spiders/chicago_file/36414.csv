Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////What an experience! Only been here twice and both times have been beyond exceptional. The food, the drinks, the service; all of it being super consistent. Had a seafood tower, steak tartare, and bone marrow; then a steak for dinner with sides of frites and the truffle Mac and cheese (was on a fat boy status that day and the next). Probably one of the best cuts of steak you can find in Chicago. My friends and I were not disappointed at all. Don't be intimidated by the people and attire in there; it varies from suits to a simple polo and jeans. Do yourselves a favor: get a reservation and enjoy. Make sure you save room for dessert. Then complain why you ate all of that delicious food the next day. Oh yeah, cause it's amazing.
