Little Goat Diner////Five stars for the food and server, 2 stars for the wait and rude hostess.  Heres why: I had a reservation at 8:30, we arrived about an hour and 15 minutes early.  After a long day traipsing around the city we decided to see if we could get in earlier.  The hostess said 20-30 after that another 20 after that another 20 until finally many non reservation parties were being served before us.  What the heck?!   We finally got seated after a hour and ten minutes.
