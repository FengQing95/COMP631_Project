Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The place is nothing fancy, cause you come here for the pizza. The prices are affordable, we shared a medium cheese for less than $15. We had enough for leftovers and despite going on a tour of the town all day, I wouldn't give the last pieces up to be thrown away. I gobbled it down far past expiration time and enjoyed every little bit.
