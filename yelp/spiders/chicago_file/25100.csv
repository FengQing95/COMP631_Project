Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////You can't visit Chicago and not get a deep dish. We got the classic with sausage, tomatoes, pepperoni, and the world famous buttery crust. Now I don't usually like deep dish, but I knew it'd be sacrilegious to get the thin crust, and I'm glad I went with my got! The pizza was delicious, the sausage was seasoned perfectly, and the buttery crust was heaven. They also have a waiting system that notifies you on your phone when it's time to be seated and you can order your pizza ahead of time to optimize pizza eating time. Next time I come I'll definitely have to try their chocolate chip pizza for dessert
