Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So we did, on our last night in the city. And we were not disappointed! The line was out the door, but somehow we got a table at 5:30. It takes about 30-45 minutes for the pizzas to cook, so many times they let you order ahead of being seated, that way your pizza will be on its way to you before you know it.
