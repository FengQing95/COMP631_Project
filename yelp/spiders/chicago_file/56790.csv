Smoque BBQ////Also very impressive were most of the sides.  Though I'm not a huge fan of coleslaw in general, the others in my party found this coleslaw to be excellent-- great flavor, with some apple added.  The mac n'cheese and the cornbread were both ridiculously good.  When you first get the little cup of mac n'cheese it seems small but the richness is such that the serving is perfect.  The cornbread is also baked in little individual cups and is very rich and delicious.  The fries were nicely seasoned and cooked perfectly.
