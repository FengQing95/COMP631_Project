Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////No disappointments on the food and service.   We had the order of signature omelet and blissful pancakes and veg mexicana omelet with red velvet french toast for 1 dollar extra.  The red velvet french toast was very moist and succulent to the every piece of it.    There is no way you can go wrong and our sever Anisa was just perfect with service.   She wasn't quite the novel to her profession and her timing to serve us the food was to the T.   I would recommend the wildberry juice as it quite refreshing to have in the morning!   One fault is the wait line which some times it can me be hassle where the line is 45 minutes.  We were there at 9:30 am for a Sunday with 15 minutes.  Go as early as you can.  The hostess must have not had her cup of joe and it took her while to comprehend the inquires and responses.   However, the flighty host should prevent from attending such a great brunch place.
