Little Goat Diner////This place was really cool! The vibe was fun energetic and artsy.. Our server was so friendly and helpful . My wife had a sandwich that was flavorful and full of character! I had the goat burger with an egg and kimchi really good! the goat meat was a little different then what I'm used to possibly a touch tough but not bad. The hot crab dip with ritz crackers were really good! I would definitely go back!!
