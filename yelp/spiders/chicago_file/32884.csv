Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Seriously impressed with our dinner at Bavette's. The service was top notch - everyone was knowledgeable and extremely attentive. We were given a personal tour of the restaurant by the manager who was so helpful and sweet. The ambiance was incredible - dark, rich woods, amazing chandeliers and a posh downstairs area that was both cozy and romantic. The food....in a word, amazing. We had the apple and endive salad, the tomato/bacon salad (omg, the bacon was to die for and the tomatoes grilled to perfection). The filet was melt-in your-mouth perfection. I'll definitely be returning to try more items from this menu.
