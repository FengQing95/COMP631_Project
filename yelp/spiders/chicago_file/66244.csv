Little Goat Diner////Some of the dishes are really good here. The beef sandwich or grilled cheese e.g. But I have a hard time with a number of things. What's with "Sammiches" on the menu? What are we, 7 year olds? That makes me think we are in for cutsiness not substance. Some of the dishes are just weird--bacon milkshake? Pork belly pancakes? And most are over priced. Everything is a la carte too, with servers trained to upsell. The entrees are large, so you don't really need that side of fried pickles and onions for $9. It's not that good anyway. The fried chicken looked good but if you want a biscuit with that it's Â another $2. Bagel? OK but a smear is another $0.75. Again, some dishes are great. Probably because of all the cheese and frying and fat..oh..very noisy too if it's crowded. Hard to relax with that noise level. But if you don't mind overpaying for some of the unhealthiest dishes in the city at a restaurant run by one of the most overrated chefs in the country then by all means go. But just because it has goat or pork belly in it doesn't make it gourmet.
