Little Goat Diner////Ill be honest the food here is really good but for the prices regardless of neighborhood it isnt worth it.  Tons of great reviews, place is trendy , and always packed.  But when 2 omelletes coffee and a cinnamon bun are about 50 dollars you need to ask why?  I has a southeastern style one- yes the salsa was fresh, and tortilla had good crunch.  But i can go to a diner down the street for  good breakfast food and it be half the price.  In going against the grain as breakfast should never cost this much without alcohol
