Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went there last night with a small group of people (6) to enjoy some tapas and that was exactly what we did. The scallops wrapped in bacon were so good that after we finished our first 12 plates we ordered another set of scallops. The other highlights were the tenderloin and horseradish, the goat cheese (of course), and the spicy potatoes are always tasty. I am not a big sangria person but everyone else seemed to enjoy it since they went through 3 pitchers or so. The service was good, the restaurant is loud, and parking is always a challenge but overall the place is somewhere that I will continue to go back to.
