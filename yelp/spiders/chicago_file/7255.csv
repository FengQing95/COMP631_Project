Art Institute of Chicago////I have NEVER been treated so rudely before. I came in yesterday ready to use my chase rewards cards allowing entrance to the Institute and was unaware that the policy had recently changed, requiring my chase card to be shown. I have used my reward card before without my chase card so didn't bring my card. The woman with chin length brown hair (sadly I didn't get her name) told me about the new policy in a very rude manner. I explain this misunderstanding and that I had driven into the city from Evanston and paid for parking and this didn't seem like that big of a deal just a misunderstanding. I told her I would bring my card next time. She refused to listen or understand my situation. She refused to let me speak to someone else about the matter and very inappropriate in her manner. She stopped talking to me and started addressing someone else in line even though there were at least 5 workers there to help the other customers. I was shocked that she has a job dealing with the public. There obviously needs to be different screening or training for workers. I then had to use the restroom and was denied the restroom after explain my experience and told by an employee of the Art Institute to go to Starbucks and use their bathroom for customers only. REALLY you're suggesting the public to use another business's restroom? This is so tacky and unacceptable!! SO DISAPPOINTED!!
