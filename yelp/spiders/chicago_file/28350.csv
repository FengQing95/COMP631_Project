Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Not exactly a guilty pleasure pizza that I'm familiar with, but the fresh ingredients of the pizza was sooo delicious. Definitely has a really good quality to the pizza and I can see how they successfully gained loyal customers and momentum bc of the great quality. THE TOMATO SAUCE IS ON POINT. My only flaw with the pizza is that my pizza was rather hard to cut with, but my friend didn't have the same problem with her pizza.
