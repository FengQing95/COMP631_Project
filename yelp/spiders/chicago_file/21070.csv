Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////But, no. It wasn't. Pizza came, we ordered deep dish and thin slice so we could try both. The servers were really weird... I would think they'd just leave the pizza on the table and let us dig in, but insisted on cutting all the slices and serving them to us... OK, no big deal. That's nice I guess. BUT once everyone got a slice of each, there were of course still some slices left and they just stood there staring at us like they wanted someone to take the rest... Why not just leave the rest on the table??? They eventually did... But I just thought that this process was just really strange. Anyways, so the pizza. Pretty disappointing. It wasn't crispy and buttery like many people state and also barely any tomato sauce. The inside of the dough seemed like it could use some extra time in the oven to cook more. And the toppings... More like what toppings?? Cheese, again I'm not fond of, but even I know that wasn't good. My husband who LOVES cheese as much as I love bread said it wasn't good. So yeah... Not sure if it was an off day for them cause everyone else seems to rave about this place, but I definitely would not come back. Especially with that wait. No thanks. The thin crust was just OK, nothing special. Both lacked flavor.
