Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We attempted to come back here the following night with friend's and family, we had a group of nine people. It was a Friday night, and the streets were full! We should have made reservation s to the restaurants that would accepted it, rather than roam the street in hopes that we could find food somewhere. The wait here was two hours and you could call them in advance and they will cook your order halfway and finish it when you were seated. We waited for about 30 minutes before we were done. We decided to leave and grab something else; because there was no way we were going to be able to sit outside for another two hours in the freezing cold with our three year old. Keep in mind, it was December.
