Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza itself was delicious, very fresh products, the sausage was well seasoned, but and the tomato sauce was really fresh with some larger chunks of tomato.  I enjoyed the pizza because the crust was not too thick, but the only issue I had was the buttery crust.  It made it kind of flaky and taste like a biscuit, which in turn made it a little more doughy then I would have liked.
