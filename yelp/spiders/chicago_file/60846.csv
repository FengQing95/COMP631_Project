Smoque BBQ////Picked up a $60 order to-go.  Walked out to our car and realized we locked our keys (both sets) in the car!  &@$€*#!!!  It took AAA an hour to arrive (this is where I was practicing my meditation skills and staying in the moment a la Buddha).  The owners, Barry and Al, both came out to check on us and offer help but, unfortunately, neither of them knew how to break into cars.
