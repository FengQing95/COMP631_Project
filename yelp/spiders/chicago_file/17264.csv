Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Love! Â The salad - great; the pizza - great; the beer - great; the server - great. We added pepperoni to the Classic and it was very good. I wish I could remember our server's name because he did an excellent job. He was friendly and attentive without being over-bearing. As usual, everything was delicious!
