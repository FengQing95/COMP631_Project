Little Goat Diner////I had been here for breakfast which is definitely good, but this was my first visit for dinner. Â Our server was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu, though getting a refill on water or our drinks delivered took waaaay too long. Unfortunately my dinner choice, which was recommended by our waitress, was bad. The veggie burger was mushy, not very tasty and really below average. We did have the hot crab dip with ritz crackers to start and it was decent, but next time I'll be sticking with the breakfast food.
