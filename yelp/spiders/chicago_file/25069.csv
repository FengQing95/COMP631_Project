Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The worst pizza ive ever had in my life Â (i woulnt even call it that) and service is so far below subpar you will wonder how; do yourself a favor and go get some true Chicago thin crust pizza elsewhere. Its all hype and you will he waiting an hour or more while paying quadruple for a block of cement! Youve been warned...
