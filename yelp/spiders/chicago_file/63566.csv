Smoque BBQ////Let's be honest for a minute, you don't care what I ordered, and I won't waste your time by telling you.  Let me just say that everything, every rib, brisket, pulled pork/chicken, and side is worth your order.  Come early, come often, and come in relaxed fitting pants.  It's BYOB so you can even wash it all down with your favorite beer.  What more can you ask for in a neighborhood restaurant?  Maybe a fitness center next door?  I wouldn't go mind you, but the option would be nice.
