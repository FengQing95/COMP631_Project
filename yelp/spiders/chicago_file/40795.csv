Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is one of the best places for tapas in Chicago besides Cafe Iberico. I highly recommend the Sangrias (you might want to get a pitcher - they are THAT good), the spicy potatoes are always a hit with everyone that tries them, and pretty much everything else on the menu! The environment is really cool and spacious - go with a bigger group of people, you'll want to share and experience all the delicious tapas. Watch out though, this place gets packed on weekend nights. Be expected to wait over an our for a table and even around a half an hour with a reservation! Make reservations way ahead of time (7-9 reservations go quickly). And parking will be hectic and you might need to valet - I think it's around $10. My only main beef with Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is that Â the bar drinks are upgraded by a few bucks. And since you almost always have to wait for a table and therefore have to order drinks at the bar which is so packed. Last time I visited me and my friends realized that we were paying $4-5 extra for a sangria pitcher plus tip for ordering with the server at the bar :( Although I've also heard that this is common among restaurants. Regardless, Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is definitely worth your effort and wait for some of the most delicious tapas you'll taste!
