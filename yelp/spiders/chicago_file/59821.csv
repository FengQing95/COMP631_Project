Smoque BBQ////the cole slaw was the kind that doesn't have mayo, which i know if supposed to be better and maybe even classier, but i'd rather have my mayo! especially with barbecue. but i'm not complaining as it was a refreshing addition to the meal and still had a nice tangy flavor. speaking of tangy flavor, i don't think i liked their sauce very much, which was a huge disappointment. it was just more sweet than anything else, and i wanted a lot more flavors and different ones at that.
