The Purple Pig////Came on a Friday evening and got a seat at the bar immediately. Pork shoulder recommendation was delicious. I was not a fan of the black seeds on top which I am guessing are for crunchiness. As a result, I ordered a side of broccoli to give a more balanced texture along with a slight savory taste. Overall, it was a good experience.
