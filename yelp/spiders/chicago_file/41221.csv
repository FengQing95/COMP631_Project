Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I loved the authenticity of this place; I went with 3 girlfriends who had lived in Spain and were very excited about going. Our reservation was at 9:30, and we arrived with 5 minutes to spare. We still had to wait about 25 minutes for our table, which was annoying especially since we weren't a big party, only 4 of us. Once sat, everything went fairly well. The waiter was attentive and good about making recommendations with such a large menu. They were out of the salmon dish that we wanted, and he made a recommendation for the scallops, which we ordered. However, we were brought a completely different dish, and it seemed toward the end that something was lost in translation and the scallops were brought out long after everything else. We actually had to ask where they were in order to get them. The bacon-wrapped dates were fantastic, and the sangria was delicious. My friend got a mojito and said it was "acceptable". However, we were shocked when we got the final bill and it was only $21/person! Very affordable, though of course tapas completely depends on what you order. We all loved the bite-size desserts; I got the banana one and it was the perfect amount of sweetness at the end of the meal.
