Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I recently visited this place to celebrate our anniversary. Making reservations through the Open Table website was very easy. They don't have parking but there was plenty of parking on the street on a Friday night which didn't require us to pay. It was our first time there and everything was great. The food, the service and the ambiance. My favorite tapas of all was the shaved Brussels sprouts but everything was delicious. Our server was a sweet older gentleman that made great suggestions since it was our first time there. He even knew that we were celebrating our anniversary and he brought out some dessert on the house for us which was also very delicious. We will definitely be returning and recommending this place to others.
