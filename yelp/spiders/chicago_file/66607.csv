Little Goat Diner////OMG. I absolutely love this place! I had been wanting to come here for months, but it just never worked out. So when I decided to throw a birthday dinner I knew this would be the perfect spot, and I was right. For starters we had a party of 8 and it's great because they sat us at this huge table so everyone could chat and share their enormous portions of food. They have fantastic drinks and of course a mouthwatering menu. I ordered the pork belly pancake and I'm still dreaming about it. It was cooked to perfection and I could eat 10 more. Everyone else also loved their dishes. The staff was wonderful as well. We arrived at 6:58 for a 7pm reservation and we were sat shortly after. Our waiter was great too! Even with the large party he still separated our checks. I made sure to tip him extra just for that! The restaurant is also super cute. The photo booth in the front is my favorite, plus it takes credit cards. You can also see your pictures online and send them to your friends. At the end of the day Little Goat is now my fave place to eat in Chicago. I highly recommend it, you will NOT be disappointed.
