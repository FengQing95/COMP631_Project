Little Goat Diner////I have to say the pork belly home fries were delicious and flavorful and came with some sort of aioli sauce and a darker sauce and they were REALLY good. My complaint though, was that there wasn't enough pork belly on them. I think on the whole dish there were only 4 pieces. They were so good that we wanted more.
