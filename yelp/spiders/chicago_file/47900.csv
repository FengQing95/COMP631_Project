Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The potatoes... and the calamari...!!! And the white peach sangria!!!! Â I cannot get enough of this place. And if you have room for dessert, the chocolate truffle was beyond amazing. Definitely going back here.. And ordering another pitcher. Also, ask for samples of the other sangrias.
