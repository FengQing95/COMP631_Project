Little Goat Diner////Large menu, so it was hard to decide what to order. I had the Bi Bim Bop Bowl, which was pretty good...pickled vegetables with cauliflower rice topped with sunny side up eggs. My husband was being picky, so he asked for a cheddar and tomato omelette (not on the menu, but they made it for him). We stopped at the bakery afterwards for a chocolate chunk cookie that was absolutely delicious! Will go back to try something from the lunch menu.
