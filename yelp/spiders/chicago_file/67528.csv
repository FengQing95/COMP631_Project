Little Goat Diner////I LOVE Girl and the Goat and was so excited to try this place! Sadly, the food was unexceptional and it was so noisy that I couldn't hear anything my friends were saying. It was actually really uncomfortable to be here. I'll suffer noisy environs for awesome food, but nothing about this experience was worth it.
