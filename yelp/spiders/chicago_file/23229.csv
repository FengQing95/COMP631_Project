Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////That's one of Lou Malnati's Pizzeria I go to when I had pizza. Last night, I went to this River North location of how nice it is. I had medium deep dish pizza with pepperoni and black olives, Lou's bruschetta and Miller Lite beer. This place was very nice that I'm totally satisfied. I'll go there again.
