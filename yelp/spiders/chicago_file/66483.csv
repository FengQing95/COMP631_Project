Little Goat Diner////Went for lunch with a friend on a Saturday around 11am. The place was full and we ended up waiting about 25 minutes, which is what they warned us the wait time would be when we arrived. While we waited we strolled through the cafe section of the restaurant which is really more of a "grab-n-go". It was also busy, which made me think we had made a smart choice for lunch.
