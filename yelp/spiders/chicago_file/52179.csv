Smoque BBQ////Well here it is. I guess it's a common theme that people basically join Yelp just to review a place, and for me that place is Smoque. I've now been here three or four times, Â gotten carryout probably 5 more times, and have officially had everything on the menu. The brisket is a revelation. Get the brisket. It is a little dry because it's BRISKET, and brisket is dry, but the chew, the flavor of the rub, and the sauce, oh my stars the sauce! The ribs are outstanding (I get St. Louis because I like meat, not just tenderness), and the half chicken is by far the most deeply flavored and moist I've ever had. My girlfriend raves about the baked beans, but I have to get two mac n'cheese and an extra side (it's like $2!) of cobbler. I can't even talk about the cobbler because there just aren't any words. The best is the taste menu. I can never settle on one thing, but since everything is so damn cheap here (a platter with two sides is $12 and change), I can get an extra side and then a bit of either brisket, chicken, or ribs (whatever I didn't order for the main), for an extra $3-4, and have it all. Surely I deserve it.
