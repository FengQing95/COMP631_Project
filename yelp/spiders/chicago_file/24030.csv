Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When the pizzas came, I honestly couldn't taste much of a difference between the two, which was disappointing. The crust was thin, crispy, and flaky, but everything inside the pizza was lacking in flavor and slid off the crust. Nothing was adhered to anything else, so eating it was strange and disconnected. The spinach in the pizza also caused it to be really watery.
