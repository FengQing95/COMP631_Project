Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We split the chicken paella 3 ways but you probably could've split it between 4 people. We also ordered spicy potatoes with tomato aioli as our tapas and it was delicious. All the food was great, very fresh and is delivered to you as it is prepared so you eat in waves. Service was great and atmosphere was enjoyable.
