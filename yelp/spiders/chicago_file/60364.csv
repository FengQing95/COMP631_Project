Smoque BBQ////Other ideas.  Think it's time to change locations, find an extra 5000 sq. ft. of seating and expand the kitchen.  Add multiple cash registers and segregate the huge lines from the tables so people who are seated and eating don't have someone standing inches from their food.  Also, I'm also sure they'd love to get a liquor license and start serving beer with their food.  BYOB is such a pain.
