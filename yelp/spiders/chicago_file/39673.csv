Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Ftom my experience It's very hard to just walk in to get a table her with a 45mins to and hour wait. But we took a chance. Got her at 6pm my husband and I. And we were able to get the best sit in the house I say. Bar stool up stairs all the way in back. Why do I say it's the best table because you don't have to worry about anyone walking pass and bumping your chair and you are sitting up high. We order the shrimp scampi which its usually good
