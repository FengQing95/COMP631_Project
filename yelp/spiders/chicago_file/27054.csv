Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were recommended Lou Malnati's (which I kept misunderstanding as Illuminati) by multiple people during our last trip to Chicago. I've visited other deep dish pizza establishments in Chicago before, and while they've tasted good, I've never felt totally wowed by deep dish pizza.
