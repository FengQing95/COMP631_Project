Smoque BBQ////But really, overall it's very good. The baby back ribs were a little small, which was fine, and nicely cooked. The pulled pork and sliced brisket had excellent flavors, and the smokiness was balanced without being overwhelming. Parts of the brisket were really fatty, but it was a normal, not weird/gristly, fat. The texas sausage was my least favorite meat, although it wasn't bad. The chili with brisket was tasty but plain, and the macaroni and cheese was probably the best thing I had, and I'm not sure if that is a good or bad sign. Anyway, it's very good, the employees are great and keep the place moving, and we didn't have a wait a little after noon on a sunday but it was filling up as we were there.
