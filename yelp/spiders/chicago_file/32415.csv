Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Unpopular opinion: reporting here from 2021's state with best pizza - NJ! Ya'll I was skeptical about trying deep-dish pizza, but I had to do it being in Chicago for the first time. My expectations were real low; however, I have to admit I was ever-so-pleasantly surprised. I was proven wrong by this delicious custom deep dish with butter crust. Heaven in each bite. Dare I say, better than many pies I've had in NJ. Not the best looking pizza, but boy does it hit the spot. My husband and I shared the bruschetta (amazing!) and a small pie with veggies and light cheese (still cheesy!) and it was filling! Keep in mind that the deep dish pies take approximately 45 minutes to cook, but believeeee me, it is worth the wait.
