The Purple Pig////The restaurant is crowded with a lot of communal tables. The family-knit atmosphere follows with the family-style of sharing multiple dishes though. Between the four of us, we shared 6 dishes, which was the perfect amount. My favorites had to be the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder ($19) and Chicken Thigh Kebabs ($17). The pork shoulder was perfectly cooked and just fell off the bone. The tenderness of the meat paired so smoothly with the pureed mashed potatoes for this divine consistency. As for the chicken kebabs, they came in huge pieces grilled on a skewer on top of beautifully roasted potatoes. The potatoes were so crispy, yet soft that just made every bite so heavenly. I'd definitely get these two dishes again.
