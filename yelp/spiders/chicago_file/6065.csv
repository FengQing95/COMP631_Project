The Purple Pig////Went here with a reservation and had a great time. At first glance, it was a bit confusing because the restaurant is located inside another building, but we managed to find it. Ordered many things to try the menu and my favorite was the Pork Tongue. My dad ordered it on a whim and boy was it worth it!! Definitely will be returning when back in town, especially after learning they are switching to 'reservations needed' after it worked out so well during COVID.
