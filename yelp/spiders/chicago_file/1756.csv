Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I'm posting this after a third failed (separate) attempt at ordering for takeout.   The place is overrated-  always an extremely long wait.   Granted, I'm not a breakfast type of person and the food is decent (when they get their orders right).   The reason why I give them two stars is that they have repeatedly screwed up my takeout order.   They redeem themselves by giving gift cards which is why I continue to go there.
