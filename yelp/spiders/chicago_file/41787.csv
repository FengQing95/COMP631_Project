Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////If you have been wanting to jump in on the Tapas trend going on here in Chicago then Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is the place to try it! The prices are way better than Tavernita and the food just as good. I recommend the scallops, patatas bravas or chicken empanada but I don't think you could go wrong with any of the dishes.
