Art Institute of Chicago////My family is only moderate fans of art, but there are so many famous painting in this museum it is really worth seeing. Plus the well positioned wide open spaces allow you to feel like you have time to stand and view a piece for as long as you like. My entire family thought the Charles Ray exhibition had several interesting pieces of modern art.
