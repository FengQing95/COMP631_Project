Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food was awesome.  I love bacon wrapped dates and was amped to see them on the menu.  I also had the ham and chicken croquetas.  I tried a bit of everything my friends ordered, and only one dish disappointed.  The chicken curry had no flavor to it, but you can't win them all.  My friends also hyped up the sangria, so I couldn't wait to try it.  It was awesome.  I had the peach and I think blackberry sangrias.
