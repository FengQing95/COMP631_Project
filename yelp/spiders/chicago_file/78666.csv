Little Goat Diner////- Little pig went to China (4.5/5): Â sausage egg biscuit with chili oil and blueberries. Didn't know what to expect here but wow. Explosion of flavors in your mouth. It has a tangy salty savory taste with a hint of freshness from the blueberries. Biscuit is fluffy and slightly buttery. The chili oil is not spicy but has a hint of pepper spice to it. Egg was cooked perfectly and complimented this dish so well. I didn't taste any numbing Sichuan pepper in the sausage -- it tasted more like a homemade meat sausage patty.
