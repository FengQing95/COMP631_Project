Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////pork but for whatever reason we decided to try it. I'm so glad we did. It was packed full of flavor and all the meats were so tender and flavorful. All the ingredients were a nice balance of flavor. I didn't try the other paella dishes however I can definitely vouch for this one! TRY IT!
