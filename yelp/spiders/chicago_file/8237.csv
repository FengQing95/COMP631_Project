Art Institute of Chicago////Some things make you wish you had more time. A good book. A dying pet. An X-Files boxed set. The Art Institute of Chicago. With the new Modern Wing, it's the second largest art museum in the United States, and you absolutely cannot realistically cover the whole museum in one visit, unless you rush through, skipping most of the descriptions and placards and not being able to appreciate the works of art.
