Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went in based on the great reviews. Was let down - the octopus dish was too greasy, hash-browns too salty, the cheese platter had a yellow cheese that on one side was dried up. The paella dish for 2-3 was going to take 1 hour to cook so we didn't get to order it. The only good thing was the bread.
