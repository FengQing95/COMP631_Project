Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My party of 5 came here for dinner around 6 PM and the wait for a table was about 45 minutes so we decided to just grab a table at the bar area. The tables at the bar area is first come, first serve and they still offer the entire menu of the restaurant. Shortly after we ordered our food, I got a text saying our table was ready on the restaurant side but we decided not to move.
