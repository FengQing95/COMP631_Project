Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My boyfriend and I were once again impressed by this Chicago deep dish pizza. We tried the Malnati deep dish last time with mushrooms, so this visit we decided to get the Lou. We liked the Lou even more than the Malnati. It was a lighter pizza, and the crust is my favorite part. This deep dish is a little less deep than the Malnati, for reference. The sauce is super good, too, and you can tell that the cheese is fresh and excellent quality. It's no wonder why Lou Malnati's is famous! Great service, delicious deep dish pizza, and overall a satisfying visit at this location!
