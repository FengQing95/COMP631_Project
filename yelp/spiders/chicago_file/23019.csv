Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Long overdue, but wanted to write a review for Lou Malnati's outstanding service. I mistakenly ordered a pizza with pork on it, and only realized it upon getting back to my place. I called them and asked if there was anything they could do about it. Without hesitation, the manager said to just come back and they'd get us the right pizza. No questions asked, right off the bat. The pizza was great as it always is, but the service here is what truly made it exceptional.
