Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Food: WOW. Shrimp cocktail, Elote Corn, Mashed Potatoes, 22oz Prime Bone-In Ribeye, wine, coffee, malted whiskey ice cream.  Everything was phenomenal.  Ryan told us steaks were big enough to share, and that the kitchen recommended that they cut the steak accordingly.  The steak came perfectly done, and cut just right to make it shareable. The Elote corn was to die for; it's an absolute must-order.  The roasted garlic on the mashed potatoes was awesome: roasted until it was almost as soft as melting butter.
