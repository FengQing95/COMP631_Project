Smoque BBQ////Amazing!  I have always been skeptical of BBQ in chicago, but now Smoque has changed all that.  I stood in line for about 45 minutes on a Saturday night, but it was well worth the wait.  I had the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich (1/2 brisket, 1/2 pulled pork).  The coleslaw, baked beans, Mac and cheese, and peach cobbler were all equally amazing.   My only complaint is that this place should either be bigger or they should open another location.  Yum!
