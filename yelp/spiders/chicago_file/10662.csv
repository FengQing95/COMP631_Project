Art Institute of Chicago////This place is HUGE! I spent 4 hours here and missed entire wings of the museum. A membership is more economical if you live in town and plan to go several times. I have a household membership which also allows for 2 free guests, awesome for our visitors! The membership also gets you discounts in the cafe and museum shop, and a free tote bag! There is also a members' only lounge, and free coat/bag check for members too - it adds up!
