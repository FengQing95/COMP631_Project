Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ate at Cafe BBR over a decade ago and it set the standard for tapas.   A meal I still remember so many years later.    I've tapas this good once at another restaurant in Washington DC, but that's it.  We live near San Francisco, have been to France, and Italy and other places.  BBR still sets the bar.  We've been to BBR in Las Vegas and it has also been great, though they've had to de-emphasize tapas and go more with main dishes such as paella since the crowd there apparently understands going to a  "topless place" but not "tapas place".
