Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was hands down the best pizza I have ever eaten. I don't even really like pizza that much, but I would come back here everyday if I lived in Chicago. Get the butter crust. You have to wait 40 min for your pizza to cook, but I would have waited even longer if I knew how incredible it was going to taste. Come and you will not regret it!! I just got the original/traditional with butter crust and pepperoni!
