Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I'd give this place 3.5 stars.  The food is good for a breakfast place.  Actually, its pretty average, but when you take into account the crap most other places try to put off as breakfast, the food here is pretty good.  There was nothing special.  I ordered the veggie skillet and it was ok.  Now, I judge most bfast places by the way they serve my eggs.  I always order them scrambled softly.  This does not mean to return to me half cooked gooey eggs.  This is how they were served to me at Wildberry. This wasn't the first time I've had this happen, so I just sucked it up and ate them.  Like I said, average.  Coffee (intelligentsia) was awesome (it's also my favorite).  There was a 45 minute wait on a Sunday. That, and the location in the busy downtown area is enough for me to say that I probably won't be back.  HOWEVER, if I ever find myself in this area and there's not a huge crowd hanging out the door, I'd eat here again.
