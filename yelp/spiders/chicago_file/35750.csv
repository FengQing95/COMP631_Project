Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Favorite restaurant for special occasions and dates. Love the byob wine policy, shared a glass with another couple celebrating a birthday. Decor is beautiful. You can splurge and get a ton of drinks and sides. But also could be an affordable dinner if you can refrain from ordering everything
