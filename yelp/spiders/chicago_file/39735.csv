Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Managed to snag a reservation. Despite it being earlier than usual for dinner, the setting worked well. Cocktails were spot on and oysters, though small, were good. The steak was excellent - well seasoned and spot on for med rare. Waitstaff we're all well seasoned professionals. I liked the variety of wines by the glass for only one in the party drinking. Overall - an excellent experience. It's pricey but worth it.
