Art Institute of Chicago////This museum is set right on Michigan Avenue and very close to major attractions. Plan on spending at least three hours in this beautiful place. Â The way it is set up is also wonderful with spacious rooms and galleries that are certainly not overwhelming in space. Very doable!
