Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Some of us are creatures of habit.  We find comfort and security in doing certain things in certain places.  In Chicago, I always do my best to tuck into the best Chicago Style deep dish pizza I can lay my mitts on.  Ya, not particularly adventurous or clever or healthy but fuck man, when I'm on the road I need something to tether my frayed nerves and disrupted patterns to. Like most non-natives I've worked my way through the typical stuff (Gino's etc.) but my last 3 visits I've settled in nicely with Lou, bolting down a regular dealer for my dirty habit.  I rationalize it in all kinds of stupid ways.  For example, I order take out and pick a route that requires a solid mile of running to get there and back.  I try to land early enough I can have it for lunch AND dinner later that day and I throw in a guilt assuaging salad.  "Ya, ya" you say, "whatever gets you through the night, man.  but how is the actual god damn pizza?" well, my brusque, review-reading friend, the pizza is fan-fucking-tastic. Dense resilient texture somehow balanced perfectly against the toppings, cheese and sauce.  Not gummy or clumpy, not overly cornmealed.  The sausage disc is amazing, the spinach mix is wonderful, I appreciate that the sauce isn't too chunky but add sliced tomatoes regardless.  This is the Baby Bear of deep dish pizza: not too cheesy, not too crusty, not too saucy.  Just good.  damn good.  I'm currently resisting the urge to take one home with me.  Let the magic stay here in Chicago, it always turns my travel frown upside down.
