Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As someone who has visited many amazing restaurants in Chicago, it is a rare occasion when I rate a restaurant with 5 stars. If I could, I would give Bavette's 100 stars. I went to dinner last night with my fianc√© and we were in heaven the entire meal. We sat in the basement which I highly recommend for a date night. If you have been to Gilt Bar's basement restaurant Curio, the basement has a very similar feel. We started with the peppered duck and goat cheese terrine and the wedge salad. Both were out of this world. The goat cheese and duck balanced eachother perfectly. The wedge salad had the most amazing blue cheese dressing and was topped with home cured bacon that is so so delicious. For our entree we shared the aged bone in rib eye and it was juicy, flavorful, and everything a steakhouse steak should taste like. We also had the pommes frites and they were perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. The garlic aioli served with the frites had the perfect amount of seasoning. For dessert we shared the cheesecake and like the rest of our meal, it was amazing. One last thing to note-the service was impeccable the entire evening. We will definitely be back! I am salivating thinking about getting to go back... :)
