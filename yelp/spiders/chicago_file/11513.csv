Art Institute of Chicago////After living in the Chicago area all my life, it took me moving out of state and coming back for a vacation to finally get me to visit the Art Institute. For my first time being here, I was certainly blown away. First off, by the shear size of the gallery, second, by the incredible work. It was awesome to see such famous pieces that I've only ever seen in books or on the internet. The gallery was enjoyable to walk around, clean, easy-ish to navigate, the audio tour was enlightening, the gallery cafe was decent and moderately priced, and the staff were for the most part welcoming to interact with.
