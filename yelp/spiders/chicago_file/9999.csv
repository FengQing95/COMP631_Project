Art Institute of Chicago////I was so impressed with the Art Institute! Their collections are incredible. I have been to museums all over the world and the Art Institute easily figures as one of the best. We tried to see as much as we could in one day, but couldn't see it all. I would definitely go back again and again until I see everything!
