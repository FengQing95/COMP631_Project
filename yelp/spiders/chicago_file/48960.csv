Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////But I will talk about my bunch day at CBBR. It was great, but hit and misses. I got the peach sangria, mainly because of the Yelp reviews on it. I did not like the mix at all. The balance between alcohol and peach mix was not done well. I also did not receive any bread on my wait, which was also disappointing.
