Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Now we know why locals in chitown loves this place.  My husband and I are visiting from Vegas.  We wanted to try this place.  A couple of my coworkers who used to live in Chicago suggested to make sure to eat here.  So glad we decided to try it. We had ours delivered to our hotel which is really convenient.  It took the norm of about 1 hour since it does take 45 mins for it to be prepared.  We only ordered the medium. We could not even finished it.  If we only had space in my luggage or carry on I'll take the leftover with us lol.
