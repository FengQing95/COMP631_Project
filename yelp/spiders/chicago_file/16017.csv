Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We came in here so that I didn't have to leave Chicago without getting the chance to try out deep dish pizza. As we were in a rush our options were not overwhelming as we had to decide on a place that was walking distance and wouldn't take too long to eat at. Seeing the high rating and number of reviews, Malnati's seemed like the best bet and it ended up being a good call.
