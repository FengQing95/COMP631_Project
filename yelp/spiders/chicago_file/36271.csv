Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////One of the best restaurants I have eaten in 2015! We got the place recommended and booked a table six weeks in advance and got a table only at 4:30 PM for dinner. It didn't matter, it was already busy at this time. The service was professional and pleasant, the interior is amazing. From the appetizer through to dessert, everything was excellent. The taste is untraditional but not too crazy. Worth a visit!!
