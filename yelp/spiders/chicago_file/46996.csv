Smoque BBQ////My dad had raved about this place after seeing it on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives...so off we went on a random Tuesday afternoon.  I was immediately impressed when, upon walking in, the uncle of the owner was right by the cash register to help us decide what to order (since my dad apparently wanted one of everything on the menu, ha!)  I ordered half of a pulled pork with mac and cheese (SO good!) and cornbread, and my dad ordered ribs and a taste of brisket along with some fries and baked beans.  What really sold me, however, was not the delicious food (which is every bit as amazing as everyone says) but the fact that the owner's uncle checked in on us, asked my dad how his ribs and brisket were, and gave him a free new 1/4 slab of ribs when my dad remarked that his were a little dry!  The "new" ribs that he was given were much better and we left with full bellies and a smile on our faces.   I rarely even eat meat, and honestly loved this place.  I'll definitely be coming back!
