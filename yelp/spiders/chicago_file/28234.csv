Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After all of the hype I had created for my friends, the second trip was a little underwhelming. It was a Saturday night and the place super packed even for its own high standards but it tasted like the pizza had been sitting out for a while. The sauce quantity was also lacking this time so please keep up the consistency and I'll never cheat on you guys with another deep dish establishment.
