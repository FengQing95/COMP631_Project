Little Goat Diner////It was a cold rainy night.  The only thing that was going to warm my soul was some good comfort food.  Thank god my friend and I had the bright idea of stopping in at Little Goat for a no-frill, stick to your ribs kinda meal.  When we walked in, we had no idea that the diner was separate from the bakery and that meant the menus were also different.  We had gone in with a taste for the shrimp po'boy sandwich, which sadly is available only on the bakery side.  But we didn't let that rain on our parade (HA!)!  We chose to "rough" it out and take a seat at the bar, since we were to famished to wait 20 min for a table.
