Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Wildberry Pancakesand Cafe is a great place! The wait was not very long, about 10-15 minutes on a lunch hour work day. I ordered the corned beef hash skillet and I couldn't even finish my entree!  It also came with a side of two eggs I ordered sunny side up as well as two delicious pancakes.  The pancakes were fluffy, tasty and buttery.  They definitely add more vanilla and butter to their pancake batter unlike other breakfast places.  The location opened awhile ago near my office and I can't believe I haven't tried the place until now.  However, I do usually try to make dishes like pancakes and eggs at home.
