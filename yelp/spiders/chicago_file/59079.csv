Smoque BBQ////Smoque is a little place on a well-traveled corner. It is very clean and brightly lit (almost too brightly lit) and there are about 20 simple wooden tables with chairs, all of which were filled when we arrived. There is an open kitchen with a counter with friendly people, where you place and pick up your order.
