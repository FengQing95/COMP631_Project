Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Alright, here's the deal. The 2 star didn't come from the service. From what I heard, this place had one of the best deep dish pizzas in Chicago which is why I visited. Im from the DC area and tried different pizzas in different areas. For appetizer I got the calamari which was average. Nothing that sticked out about it. I don't know which one specifically I got but it seemed closest to a supreme pizza. It was cheesy and good, but it Â something just didn't seem to hit the expectations. Maybe my expectations were too high? Who knows. Something just seemed off about the sauce for me. I'll definitely try it one more time next time. The wait wasn't too long during dinner time so that was a good thing. I'd recommend you guys try it though for sure!
