Smoque BBQ////Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
