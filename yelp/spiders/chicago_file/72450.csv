Little Goat Diner////Finally when we got seated (had to share a larger table because it was that busy), we were greeted by our waitress and given menus.  She also took the time to tell us some of her favorite dishes on the menu.  That was extremely helpful because Little Goat offers an array of different entrees which can be a little overwhelming.  My sister ordered the fish tostadas (fried whitefish, shallot aioli, chickpea, and onion salad) and I ordered the chicken cordon bleu (breaded chicken, ham, sour kraut, pickled peppers, and cheese sauce on a potato bun.)  We also got an order of goat chili cheese fries to share.  Both my sister and I enjoyed everything we ordered.  Everything was very flavorful and all the different ingredients meshed really well with each other.  I never pinged myself to like goat meat, but the goat chili cheese fries were scrumptious.
