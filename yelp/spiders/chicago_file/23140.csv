Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Started with the calamari AFTER we reminded the server we ordered it. Lou Mulnati's is just ok. It comes with cold marinara sauce. You may want to ask for it to be warmed. Pizza is flavorful but I definitely prefer Giordano's over Lou Mulnati's. The salad with creamy lemon garlic dressing was unique. It was the bright spot of the meal.
