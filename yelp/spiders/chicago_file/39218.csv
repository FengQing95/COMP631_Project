Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////On to the entrees. We had the fried chicken and the Chicago cut ribeye. The chicken was tasty, but I prefer Harold's fried chicken. I guess for me, I am all about the skin on fried chicken and this chicken had a thin layer of batter but not much crispy skin. Still nice and juicy and it was served with a nice buttermilk sauce. The steak was well seasoned but the meat itself was quite fatty. For our sides we had the corn and the pomme frites. The corn was amazing. I could eat a giant bowl of that corn. The fries were mediocre.
