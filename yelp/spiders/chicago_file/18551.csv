Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I don't like pizza, but you can't go to Chicago without trying deep dish pizza, right? I'm glad I chose Lou Malnati's. I called to place an order in case there was a wait. The order was ready in 30 minutes and we took the pizzas to Millenium Park to eat. I got a personal Lou pizza and my friend got a personal classic. She loves pizza and she loves Lou Malnati's. Even though mine, the Lou pizza, only has veggies and cheese (no meat), I thoroughly enjoyed it. For deep dish pizza with butter crust, come here! Keep in mind, it usually takes at least 30 minutes for pizzas to be made.
