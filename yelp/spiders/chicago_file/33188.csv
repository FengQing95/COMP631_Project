Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is the kind of place where the bartenders put on a show, and not a Tom Cruise in cocktail kind of way, rather its like watching an artist who is so devoted to his craft that he is precise and painstakingly exact about every little detail and the finished product is a potent, yet balanced cocktail.  That rival some of the best in the city (still give my nod to Aviary though, but that is comparing apples and oranges with modern/molecular gastronomy vs. classic).  The one downfall I found was the wine list was a little lacking, but do yourself a favor and trust me on this.  Stick to the cocktails and you can't go wrong.
