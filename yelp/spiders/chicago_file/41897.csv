Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We went here for brunch and we both were impressed.  Made a reservation on Open Table and had no wait.  We both liked the small plates idea for brunch, because you could try a lot of different dishes without getting too full on one.  For example, the pancakes were just a stack of 4-5 silver dollar pancakes.  The french toast was one piece of deliciously caramelized french toast on a stick.  The deviled egg was just one half and egg, etc.  We tried everything on the tapas menu and then each had eggs benedict for the main course.  My only complaint was the date coated bacon was pretty burned.  Service was good and prices very reasonable.  We'll go back.
