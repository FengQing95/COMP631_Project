Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First of all, dont believe the hype, no that we have that out of the way we can proceed with an honest review. Â The pizzas good, I would compare it to a well made pizza hut "pizza" that didn't skimp on the toppings, or maybe a savory pizza themed "pie", calling it pizza on it's own doesn't feel quite right. Whenever I say it out loud I feel like I should be adding finger quotes, but maybe that's just my hangup as a New Yorker, though honestly I ascribe it more to my higher standards as a so called pizza afficiando, but then again New Yorker and pizza aficionado are more or less synonymous.
