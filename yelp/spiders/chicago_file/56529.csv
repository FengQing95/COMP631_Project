Smoque BBQ////A little overpriced, but this place has been the best barbecue place in Chicago for quite some time.  They cook their barbecue until it's nice and juicy.  Their sides are cooked fresh.  I always order both the baby back and St. Louis style ribs which don't disappoint.  The brisket is juicy from its own fat it cooks in and falls apart in your mouth.  By far my "Gold Standard" of barbecue here in Chicago.
