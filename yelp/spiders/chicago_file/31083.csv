Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ah, deep dish pizza... what a love/hate relationship we have! I hate it because it takes forever to make. Like, you have to budget 45 minutes for it to cook... and then wait an additional 20 minutes to actually get it because there are a million people already waiting. But I love it because it's utterly delicious and the buttery crust speaks to my soul. I ordered a small Chicago Classic which has sausage, mozzarella, tomato sauce, and that sweet, sweet buttery crust. My god, that crust is divine.
