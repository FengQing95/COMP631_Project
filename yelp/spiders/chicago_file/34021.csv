Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I am VERY behind on my reviews- sorry yelpers! I took my hubby here for his 40th birthday and we had the most AMAZING experience! The ambiance is so dark and cozy and romantic. We both LOVED it! We got a booth which is just our style. Our waiter was fantastic and put up with our menu questions- when it comes to food my hubby and I are known to ask a lot of questions. Sorry not sorry! I don't play games when it comes to my food. We decided to sort of build our own seafood tower with some shrimp cocktail and crab legs. It was the perfect amount of food to start with. We also each got a salad. I of course got the wedge because who doesn't love a wedge? IT was delicious! And we also both got steak. I went with the 10 oz filet mignon which was AMAZING! It was cooked to perfection (medium rare) and came to the table with a faint heartbeat-just as I like it. My hubby got the 10 oz filet also and he LOVED his as well. In fact he said to both me and our waiter that the steaks here at Bavette's were better than those at Chicago Cut. Not to mention the service was FAR SUPERIOR than Chicago Cut! We want to absolutely return for a seafood tower! I highly recommend Bavette's for a special occasion!
