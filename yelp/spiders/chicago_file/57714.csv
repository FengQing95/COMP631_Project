Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Over the years, this has been one of our favorite restaurants!  The food is absolutely delicious.  The service is outstanding.  And the atmosphere transports you to a magical vacation ambiance, so you just want to linger and keep eating!  Our family recently enjoyed a delightful New Year's Eve dinner here, and I want to publicly acknowledge their wonderful front desk hostess, Anita.  She not only juggles answering the phone with genuine warmth, but also kindly and patiently accommodates the requests of customers coming in the front door.  Anita's smiling presence sets the tone for an enjoyable dining experience.  We also appreciated the excellent, attentive service by everyone.  For those who want a delightful meal, I highly recommend Café Ba-Ba-Reeba!
