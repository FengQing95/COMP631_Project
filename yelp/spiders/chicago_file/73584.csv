Little Goat Diner////When I envision a diner I see pancakes, omeletes, meat loaf, biscuits, buttery toast, BLT sandwiches, coffee, etc. Not here. Yes, there are breakfast and lunch items but not the basics. I want good comfort food at a reasonable price. Not here. The spicy chicken sandwich on brioche bun was lacking flavor. The bun was too soft and sweet to hold up the chicken breast. The garlic mash potatoes were okay but where was the garlic? The waffles had an ounce of syrup, I mean bacon syrup. Plus, I hate paying for someone's rent Â - $14.00 for a chicken sandwich just because the restaurant is located downtown. Baaaaaad
