Smoque BBQ////And so we dug in wit barehands....from the first bite I saw that these guys did the simple things right, the chicken was done right from the outside and tender from within, the beans were warm and flavourful and the fries...I didnt even have them....next came the brisket.....KA-PAW!! that how it is supposed to be done.
