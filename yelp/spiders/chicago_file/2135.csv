The Purple Pig////Waited for 30 minutes, but they do text when the table is ready. So we were able to shop around the area to Kill some time. We were seated quickly and had the pork shoulder and bone marrow. Both were absolutely delicious and enough for two hungry people! We would absolutely come back to try more entrees!
