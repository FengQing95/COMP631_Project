Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////While visiting Chicago I stopped here with my brother my first night for dinner! We enjoyed a variety of tapas and some sangrias!! The food was very delicious and the staff was very nice! Â Due to my first experience we returned my last night in Chicago!! Once again I had not one complaint!!! Next time I visit I will be sure to stop again!!
