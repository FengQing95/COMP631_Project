Smoque BBQ////The coleslaw, followed by the pulled pork, was the highlight of a rather mediocre lunch here. And coleslaw should not be the best thing at a BBQ restaurant. Their famed brisket was dry despite being fatty and was a total let-down. I also wasn't a fan of the dry rub on the ribs, and something had to be off because they were extra brittle and dry.
