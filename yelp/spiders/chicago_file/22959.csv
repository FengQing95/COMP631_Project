Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visiting Chicago and I knew we had to ha s pizza! Wait was a little long but so worth it! We had the Garlic bread with Marinera, the wings and lasagna to start! ( don't judge or was 5 of us and we wanted to try a bit of everything) which was perfect because the pizza takes awhile and everything was so delicious! We got a large thin cheese and a large deep pepperoni! The buttery crust on the thin AMAZING both of them to die for!
