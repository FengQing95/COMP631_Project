Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The last time I was there it was with a decent sized group. It was late, getting close to closing time (don't you hate people that come in close to closing time) and I'm sure some of us were being a bit obnoxious. That being said, they still took care of us, got us fed, got us buzzed and sent us on our way.
