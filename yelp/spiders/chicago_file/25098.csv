Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If your looking for the Chicago deep dish pizza this is by far the best. Went on a quest at all the places here. Unfortunately I started here so everything else was sub par and I regretted spending the calories on. This place is worth the wait and you will wait. But be patient. It's the best in town
