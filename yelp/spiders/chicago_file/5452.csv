The Purple Pig////I don't brag about a lot of things, but I'm quite proud of my restaurant selections when it comes to group culinary adventures. We were at a convention and hungry for lunch. It was finally time to leave the two-block radius and take a Lyft to Magnificent Mile. Originally we wanted Lou Malnati's but the wait was too long. I've had Purple Pig bookmarked for awhile, so we headed there.
