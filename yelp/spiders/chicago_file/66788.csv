Little Goat Diner////I feel like their poularity is maybe getting to their heads because I think when someone walks about after not being waited on and you ask, "How was everything?'' and they tell you they weren't served maybe you should atleast say you're sorry. I'd go back for the breads, which were pretty good but not the airhead service.
