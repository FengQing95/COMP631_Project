Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////As far as the main dish, we orded the seafood paiai and it was just okay. The dessert was complimented to us by our waiter after we downloaded their lettuce eats app, which was really nice of him! The truffle chocolate was very small but rich. My favorite was the spicy potatoes definitely a must order! I know a lot of people love this spot and I can see why, defentily a Lincoln park hotspot!
