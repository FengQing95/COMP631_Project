Little Goat Diner////The Korean style goat burger comes on a chewy, soft roll that is perfectly adept at sopping up the gold gushing out of the perfectly cooked sunny side egg perched on top of bacon slices hiding a mound of kimchi nestled on a juicy goat patty. Â You can choose your sides here, so if you go for that burger, get the tempura fried mashed potatoes for an umami overload - in a heavenly way.
