Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've been ordering these Pizza's through gold belly for over a year and was in love with them. I recently ordered 2 of them online and something changed. They were terrible!! Â So bad that I threw 1 of them away. I can't believe Lou Malnati''s would ship these to people. They obviously made a bad batch. The pepperoni pizza hardly had any sauce and was as thin as a pizza from Domino's. The sausage pizza was even worse. I hope they can figure out what went wrong and make good pizza's again one day.
