Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had a great experience here!  Our waiter Bobby was wonderful and he had some fantastic food suggestions. For our family of 4 (plus a baby) he recommended a small thin crust for the kids so it would come out early and an individual salad and a small deep dish for my husband and I to share.  It was totally the perfect amount of food for us!  He ended the meal off with a complimentary cookie skillet that was so scrumptious!
