Smoque BBQ////Omg now i know what a true definition of a feast is!!! I dont think I need to say more. The ribs are out of this world! The (pulled?) chicken sandwich is amazing and all the sides and the peach cobbler!!! The 30 minute line was WELL worth it!!! The service is great there too, got our food fast and the bus boys were very helpful and friendly. Not a place u go to every day or even that often - am sure its not uber healthy! But every once in a while its a TREAT! Expect a long wait, but worth it!
