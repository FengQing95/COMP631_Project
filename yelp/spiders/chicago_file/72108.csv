Little Goat Diner////We ordered the Korean-style burger and goat patty melt with fries, which was pretty good but a bit salty. Also, for some reason, our waitress seemed a little surly and hard to find--something I ignored at first but eventually noticed as the meal went on, and felt specific to me and my companion as she interacted cheerily enough with the others around us. I could always chalk it up to just a long shift, but it's harder to enjoy your food with someone mean-mugging you the whole time.
