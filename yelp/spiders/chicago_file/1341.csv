Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The key here as others mentioned is arrival time; just before 8:30 it was a 10min wait, by the time we left there were people waiting everywhere, outside. Food exceeded our expectations, even with the already high rating. The homemade corned beef hash skillet was very tasty and filling. Could have went without ordering something for the kids and just splitting off of ours. Best food for the money during our trip.
