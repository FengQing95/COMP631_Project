Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've lived in Chicago for 9 years, and I have a secret: I hate deep dish pizza. I think it's kinda gross. I had only tried Giordanos, and discovered that pizza that needs to be eaten with a fork and consists of a wall of pure cheese simply does not appeal to me at all. I tried Lou Malnatis recently in order to give deep dish pizza another chance to impress me, and it did not disappoint! The crust is crispy and buttery, and you can actually pick this pizza up! The cheese wasn't overpowering the meal, and whatever sauce they're using over there is to die for. I work in tourism and I will definitely be sending customers looking for deep dish towards this place from now on. It was delicious. Well done.
