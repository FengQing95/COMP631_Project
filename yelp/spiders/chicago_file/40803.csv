Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is awesome. Whether you go there for brunch or lunch or dinner you're not going to be disapointed. The tapas are really good and there's a pretty intense selection. make a reservation as although the place is big and sits a lot of people it more often than not packed.
