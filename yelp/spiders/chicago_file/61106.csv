Smoque BBQ////The only thing that missed the mark for me was the ribs. Maybe it was because of the smaller portion, but the KC style ribs were tough and difficult to eat. We had to cut the bones apart to get to the meat. But dad took a rack of the Baby Back ones home and said they were great, so maybe I just got a bum sample.
