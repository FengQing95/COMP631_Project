Smoque BBQ////Absolutely the best BBQ joint in Chicago!! Hands down. Friendly service. Expect a wait most times you go, because people consistently crave this joint. I wish like hell that the owner would open up another joint in trendy Bucktown. :) Ribs, Brisket, Beans, sides, everything is top notch. Geez my mouth is watering just typing this.
