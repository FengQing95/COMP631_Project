Art Institute of Chicago////Awesome museum. We only had time and energy for the impressionists and would have gone back another day had it not been raining or if the museum had a covered entrance. It is immediately next to Millennium Park where 'The Bean' (Cloud Gate) and 'The Two Faces Statues' (The Crown Fountain) are located. The park is free, open to the public and a stroll through makes a nice accompaniment to an hour or so in the museum.
