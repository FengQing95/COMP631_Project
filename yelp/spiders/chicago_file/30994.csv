Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Chicago Style Pizza is a personal preference (I definitely am an ardent NY thin crust guy) but Lou Malnati's is the one place where you could convert someone - or at least get them to admit that deep dish is worth putting on the rotation... No trip to Chicago is complete without a Lou's pizza
