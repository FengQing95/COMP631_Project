Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It does take about 45 minutes, but it is well worth the wait.  For times when its crazy packed (like Saturday), they take your name and start your pizza so by the time you get a table, your pizza is almost ready.  And for all those people that whine about how long it takes to make - maybe they should just stop eating deep dish and giving low-star reviews.  That is just how long it takes to make.
