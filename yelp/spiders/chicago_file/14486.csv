Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Absolutely awesome place to be at. Fantastic service, good pizza and salad. Th manager was visible and friendly. Mark the manager kept the place moving, but you didn't feel like you were being rushed. We were told there was a 35 minute wait so we went to have a drink at the bar. We only waited 15 minutes and our table was ready. I highly recommend this place. Our dining experience from start to finish was wonderful. If we're in the area again we'll definitely be back!
