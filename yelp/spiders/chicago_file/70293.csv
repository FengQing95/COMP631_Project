Little Goat Diner////We've hair finished our meal and I'm still drooling! If you want a traditional breakfast, this is not the place for you. The menu options are so creative and sooo good. We had the chorizo maple crumpets and this little piggy went to China. Both were phenomenal! We also had a side of grits which were perfectly salty and perfectly cheesy. We decided also to get a drink, mezcalata. Amazing! Perfect mix of spice and tang. Not quite a bloody marry but not a chalata. Chili fuzed tequila, beer, and tomato juice. The only problem is they stop serving it for the spring! We'll be dreaming of the place until our next visit! The service was equally amazing! JP gave was very friendly and gave us great recommendations for the city!
