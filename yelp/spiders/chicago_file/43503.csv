Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I dined here for the first time on Thursday. I met my date around 7 pm, and the restaurant was fairly busy then, but quickly filled up around us. We started with a 1/2 pitcher of the classic red sangria, which we both liked, but agreed it would be better as a refreshing summer drink. The tapas we ordered included the citrus-cured salmon, the chicken empanada, the beef tenderloin with blue cheese, and the goat cheese with tomato sauce. The last two are musts! For dessert, we shared the dulce tres leche (listed as caramel on the menu), which was wonderful, especially when paired with the Taylor 10 year I ordered.
