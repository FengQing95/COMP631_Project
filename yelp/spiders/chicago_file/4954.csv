The Purple Pig////Unfortunately the two entrees that were ordered were only okay. The charcuterie we ordered was the best part. Cuts of Orange walnut Salami, duck prochutto were wonderful. The Gorgonzola, pecorino and brigante al tartufo was equally delicious cheese pairing along with the mustard, pickle and sweet relish sides.
