Smoque BBQ////Now onto the food...it..was...phenomenal!  I couldn't finish it all!  I was trying SO hard to but I couldn't do it!  Chopped brisket sandwich on some yummy yummy bread...mmm...baked beans yum.  I haven't had those in forever!  I wish I could have had this peach cobbler everyone was talking about but I just couldn't eat another bite.  I walked out so very happy and so sleepy from too much food.  I can't wait to go back here and get some more - thank goodness it's not a walk away or I'd be in serious trouble!
