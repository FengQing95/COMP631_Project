Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We also ordered the Malnati's salad medium size and it was very refreshing and good! It was only $8 and good enough for 2 or 3 people. The pizza comes with red sauce and tons of sausage on top and the buttery crust was the bomb. I definitely enjoy it very much and we still have half a pie leftover!
