Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I was here a few times several years ago and had all but totally forgotten about it.  The last month I was looking for a place to have dinner with a friend before a concert at the Park West.  I stumbled upon Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba and recalled fond memories of sangria and not being very adventurous with my food selections.
