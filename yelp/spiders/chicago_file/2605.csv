The Purple Pig////Food - we started with the whipped feta. Fantastic dish although i wish they offered more options to put the feta on other than a very thin cracker. That being said, the dish was really great. For the meal itself, I had the bone marrow, Â octopus and pork shoulder. While all three were great, the bone marrow was the BEST. I had no idea bone marrow could taste that delicious. I would fly from miami(where I live) to Chicago JUST for that. The pork shoulder fell right off the bone and the sauce was delicious. The octopus was highly recommended to us and while it was fantastic,the bone marrow really stood out beyond the rest.
