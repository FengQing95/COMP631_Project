Little Goat Diner////We ordered the cake of the day, Devils Food, for the 4 kids to split. Moist and super rich! My sister had the Dairy Free Chocolate Shake, which we found to be a bit thick and more similar to the consistency of a ganache. I had to wait over 5 minutes after everyone else's dessert for mine to arrive ... but when it did finally make it to the table, my Pork and Toffee Shake was delish! Huge chunks of Toffee and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
