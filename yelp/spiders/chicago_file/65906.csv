Smoque BBQ////Not sure what the hype is all about. Ordered a full slap of St Louis & Baby Back ribs, 1/2 lb each of sliced and chopped brisket. Both styled ribs were dry and lacked flavor. The briskets were mildly more flavorful but also quite dry. The meats all required a dousing of bbq sauce to make them palatable. The side dishes weren't much better. The slaw, corn bread, chili, mac n cheese Â and fries were mediocre.
