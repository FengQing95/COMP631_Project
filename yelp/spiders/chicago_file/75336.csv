Little Goat Diner////Verryyyy crowded on the Thursday before Christmas, that's for sure. We waited 30 minutes for a table for two. The atmosphere is cool, big and airy and crackling with chatter and kitchen clangor. Our waiter was great; very sweet, even when he had to deliver a real blow: no cinnabuns or 3 sisters oatmeal after 11am.
