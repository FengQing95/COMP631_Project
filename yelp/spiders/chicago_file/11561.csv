Art Institute of Chicago////One of the cooler displays was the miniature room displays on the lower level.  It was absolutely stunning and cool.  So many different rooms and they all were super cool to look at. Definitely a must see.  Also, they have a lot of other displays that you can check out while there, and the staff is reasonably helpful.
