Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Then desserts, oh the deserts.  They're fabulous, all of them.  Oh, and since I didn't mention it above: Get the elote appetizer. Don't ask questions, just get it.  Everything we had here was good. Great. Indescribably magnificent. I can't write anything more; it just makes the painful longing I have to return to this rapturous experience of an establishment stronger and stronger.  I implore you, all of you, anyone who will listen: go to Bavettes.  You owe it to yourself. Your mouth, mind, body, even your soul will thank you.  It was a dining experience I'll never forget and though I've since moved back to the West Coast, if I'm ever even remotely in the area again I guarantee I will be making a pilgrimage back here. I give it All Of The Stars out of 5.
