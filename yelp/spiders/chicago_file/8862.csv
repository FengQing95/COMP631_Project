Art Institute of Chicago////Next stop, Impressionism.  Yep, I'm a girl stereotype, I like Monet and I don't care if you judge me.  There are several Monet paintings here and each gives me pause.  People might throw out the Cher's line from Clueless (So Monet, looks good from far away, but up close it's a big ol' mess), but Monet is MEANT to be looked at from a distance.   The water lilies, poppy fields, haystacks, landscapes.  All are spectacular to me.
