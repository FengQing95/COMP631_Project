Little Goat Diner////Reuben with bacon, sauerkraut & kimchi on rye: a bit salty from the corned beef, bacon, sauerkraut, & kimchi, but the flavor was somewhat balanced by the havarti cheese. Very flavorful and delicious. Bread was perfectly crispy and browned. Outstanding dish, which was also recommended by the server.
