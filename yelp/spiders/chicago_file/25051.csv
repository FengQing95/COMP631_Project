Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is probably my favorite deep dish pizza in Chicago. Be prepared for a long wait as it always full, we arrived at 5:00 pm and the waiting was 30minutes. The deep dish pizza take Â an hour to serve. Service was impeccable . Strongly recommend this restaurant if you visit Chicago .
