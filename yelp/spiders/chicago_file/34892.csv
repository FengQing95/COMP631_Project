Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We got oysters and the bacon roasted tomatoes to start, the star here is definitely those meaty tasty bacon.  Then we splurged for the $56 dry aged ribeye, 24oz steak.  The steak is completely worth it.  If you have two people who wants steak, just go for it.  The dry age and bone makes a huge difference in taste.  Also got three sides to share, butternut squash, frites and elote corn that everyone raves about.  Sides were great and it's a good way to try a bunch of things with your eating mates!
