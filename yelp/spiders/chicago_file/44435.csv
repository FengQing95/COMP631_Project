Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went for brunch on Valentine's Day. I'd been for dinner before and thought it was good but brunch put this place at 5 stars for me. We had 1 brunch Pintxos and 5 brunch tapas options and ALL of them were great! My favorite savory items were the waffle-battered chicken stick and the sausage-fried paella. My favorite sweet item was hands down the buttermilk waffles with warm caramel bananas. Definitely recommending this place to everyone looking for a brunch spot. Unique items, great flavor, affordable prices, and awesome atmosphere.
