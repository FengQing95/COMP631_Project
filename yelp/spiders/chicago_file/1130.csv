Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////3.  The pancakes were good and my wife thoroughly loved the mochi texture.  I thought they could have used a bit more flavor.  My attempt at gluten free pancakes yielded similar results, though they were not as puffy.  We suspect they had either corn or rice flour in them, though we did not order "gluten free."
