Smoque BBQ////I ordered takeout from Smoque as I had a craving for brisket, and this place is the spot to get it (have already been here numerous times, never disappoints). I got a brisket sandwich and a pulled pork sandwich for my wife, as she vastly prefers that to the brisket. When we got home, we found that we had received two brisket sandwiches instead of one being a pulled pork. Not a big deal, and called back to explain the situation to see what could be done to correct it.
