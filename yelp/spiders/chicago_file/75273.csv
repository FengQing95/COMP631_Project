Little Goat Diner////I just happened to walk by Thursday at 930a  and decided what the heck. Always wanted to go there but never the right time.   I chose the patty melt with help of the server and upgraded to the ground goat meat. Sandwhich was delicious. The cheese was plentiful and smothered the entire thing. It had carmelized onions and some wonderful crunchy bread. I ordered fries that were a little late during the meal but were fresh out of the fryer and nicely seasoned. Need to come back for another item.
