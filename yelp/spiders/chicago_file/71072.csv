Little Goat Diner////I love this vibe. Affordable American flare (obviously features other popular food trends). But Stephanie Izard is a genius and I'm impressed with how she's been running no one but 3 popular west loop spots with cute names: Little Goat, Girl and the Goat, and Duck Duck Goat. I'm looking forward to trying out patio here and the food at the other two!
