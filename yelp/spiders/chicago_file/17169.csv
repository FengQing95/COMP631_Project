Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Being a Chicago native, this place is one of my faves and must-go places when I'm back in town.  Living on the East Coast, I miss the Chicago flavor and heartiness that represents my city!  The chocolate chip cookie dessert is right on point after a delicious pizza.  And no, when I come back to Chicago, my diet is on splurge-mode so you won't here me concerned about calories.
