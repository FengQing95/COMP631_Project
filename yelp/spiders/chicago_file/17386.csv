Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Always a good choice for Chicago style pizza! I love the sausage pizza because it is a solid layer of sausage. It is definitely way way way better than Giordano's or even Gino's East, which is sad to say because I once loved those restaurants. Lou Malnati's has it in the bag though, so definitely go here when you're craving that Chicago Style deep dish!
