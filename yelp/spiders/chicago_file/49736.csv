Smoque BBQ////Yea, it's totally a 5 star place. Smoque comes in second only to a place in Castroville CA called The Central Texas BBQ. The owners of Smoque are always in house. Their menu is fundamental and their sauce is unique. You get sat after you eat and be comfy with rubbing elbows with your neighbor for seating. They also cut their fries fresh. Smoque is also BYOB. You could also call your order in and they will give you a specific pick up time. I'd say the best BBQ on the north side and perhaps all of Chicago.
