Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I couldn't leave Chicago without having some of their famous Deep Dish Pizza. While shooting some street photography with a friend a native Chicago resident he suggested this place and I couldn't have been any more pleased. While there was a short wait to be seated due to covid capacity limits, the wait is with it. We had the Malnati Classic with Patti Sausage and it was amazing, along with toasted cheese bread which taste just as great as the pizza. Our server was amazing. The drink menu is amazing I had the Windy City Sour it was amazing. This place will be one of my go to spots when I come to Chicago. You won't be disappointed.
