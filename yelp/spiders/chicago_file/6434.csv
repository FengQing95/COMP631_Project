The Purple Pig////The squid ink tagliatelle was our favorite dish. The pasta tasted house made and it came with a generous portion of shrimp and scallops. The cherry tomato sauce was nice and sweet, we enjoyed this dish best and we almost didn't order pasta! The pork shank osso bucco had highs and lows. The actual pork was amazing, fork tender, and in a tasty sauce. It came with what I think was collard greens and beans. The beans were fine but the greens were so salty! We couldn't take more than a few bites. Maybe the sauce was reduced too much and concentrated the salt but we were disappointed that we had to leave some behind on the plate.
