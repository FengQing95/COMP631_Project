Smoque BBQ////Big, bold, smoky BBQ flavors and that's what smoque is all about.  The only downside that it's not good for your cardiovascular system but who cares when you've got awesome briskets and ribs in front of you.  I am a fan of their sides as well, mac n cheese and cole slaws are my favs.  The service is great as well, the guy who took our name down for seating told the cashier to do half-half on ribs (st. louis and babyback) and different sauces for us to dip our ribs & pulled porks into.  Be ready for a smoky BBQ meaty goodness when you walk in!
