Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The food was amazing. I had the corned beef and hash skillet with cinnamon bun French Toast. The corned beef was not from the can, I could tell it was hand prepared. The cinnamon bun French Toast was awesome. It was so much food we almost couldn't finish it all, but it was so good we continued eating.
