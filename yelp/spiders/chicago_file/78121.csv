Little Goat Diner////Id highly recommend making a reservation, because even the counter space filled up quickly. I couldn't decide what to order (shocking), so I went with the special. I can't remember what it was called, but it was essentially a Cobb salad on top of two pieces of avocado toast with fried egg and fried chicken. I also had coffee and a mimosa.
