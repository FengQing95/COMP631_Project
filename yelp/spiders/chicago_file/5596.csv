The Purple Pig////Great service! Was actually able to get a seat right away. I got the bone marrow to start. I've never tried it before and it was amazing. i got the octopus and it was tender and delicious. The pork shoulder was so juicy and literally just fell apart, no knife needed. All in all small portions but crazy good flavor. I will be back!
