Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was in Chicago for the first time, so of course I had to check out the famous Lou Malnati's - it did not disappoint! I went on a weekday a little before noon and thought it was odd that there was barely anyone in the restaurant. However, 30 minutes later, the restaurant was completely full and a line had formed. I've never been a huge fan of deep dish pizza, mainly because the crust is always too dense. While the crust on this pizza was indeed thick like traditional deep dish, it was light, buttery, and absolutely delicious. The toppings were also fresh and generously distributed. Lou Malnati's made me realize I actually do like deep dish pizza and I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Chicago.
