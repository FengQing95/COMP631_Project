Little Goat Diner////Truly disappointing experience! We used to like this place. The experience began with the hostess. As soon as we were being seated, my boyfriend asked for a cup of hot coffee. Her response was "I'm not your server", then she walked away and continued talking with another hostess. She did not care about my boyfriend's request and did not even tell our server about the request of hot coffee. We had to wait for 5 minutes for the server to come to the table. Sophia was our server, she did not smile and did not introduce herself. We knew her name from the receipt. The service was very slow and we felt like we were begging her to serve us food. She did not look like she had a good time working there, seemed like she did not want to work and had a horrible day. Sophia was incredibly rude. We tried to avoid looking at her face the whole time we were there, we felt miserable just looking at her angry face. She never said thank you or you're welcome. The food was good but Sophia ruined everything. We are not sure if we will ever come back to Little Goat because of the bad server like Sophia. Absolutely disappointing!
