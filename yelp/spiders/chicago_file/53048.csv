Smoque BBQ////So what's holding them back?  A sad absence of pickles, onions and potato salad.  Then again, the owner (manager?) said it's perfectly fine to bring my own jar of pickles next time, so bonus points for Smoque.  I'm serious about the potato salad, though - a Texas BBQ dinner just isn't complete without it!
