The Purple Pig////I came here with my parents for lunch and I put my name down on the list. Although the wait was a long time, i really appreciated their organization with the waiting list. When i put my name down I thought that I had to wait at the restaurant until my name was called. I was relieved to find out that they took my number down as well so that I could go out and do my errand or shopping until my name was called through a text message.
