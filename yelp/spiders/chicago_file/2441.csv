The Purple Pig////I had such a delicious meal! It was absolutely packed on a Tuesday evening! And they had big long tables, so they seated me and another lady next to each other at the end of the table. We ended up chatting and sharing all of our meals... it's kind of a place where sharing is the way to go... sort of small plates and lots of amazing choices! I didn't get a picture of the amaaaaaazing broccoli (with an anchovy roasted garlic sauce) and the beets with frothy blue cheese and pistachios... but they were awesome! Then we shared ginger pork belly with carrots and Spanish octopus with green beans and fingerling potatoes. Then the gal and I shared lemon panna cotta and the guy sitting next to us shared his cheesecake... I almost died that cheese cake was so good... it was like the Fourth of July in my mouth. Seriously!
