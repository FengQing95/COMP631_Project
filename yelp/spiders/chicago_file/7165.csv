Art Institute of Chicago////The collection of architectural ornament is essential viewing for anyone who is a fan of Chicago architecture.  The exhibition of Louis Sullivan drawings was a rare opportunity to gain insight into a master's creative process.  His preserved Chicago Stock Exchange Trading room is his monument, and a testament to the work of the Art Institute.
