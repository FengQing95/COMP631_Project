Little Goat Diner////There are enough reviews on the nachos and pork belly pancake, but the crumpets and quesadilla don't get enough attention! The crumpets come with some kind of citrus fruit, chorizo, and is topped with syrup! It sounds strange, but is the perfect sweet and salty and acidic combo. I wish they would bring it back. Veggie quesadilla is so creative and is perfect if you love goat cheese. I don't like vegetarian options so I never get veggie things, but this was delicious.
