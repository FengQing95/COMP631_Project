The Purple Pig////1. My favorite had to be the cuttlefish: when the dish was over I was wanting more! The cuttlefish was cooked to perfection where you had a taste of chat on the outside but was so soft and tender on the inside! Paired with charcoal bread (which was ok) and a perfect blend of what seemed like mostly salty bean sauce and a citrus yellow sauce all meshed to form a Harmony in my mouth
