Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizzas were delicious. On our two visits we had three different pizzas. The Classic, with a full layer of lean sausage on top of the buttercrust, The Lou, basically a veggie pizza with spinach, mushrooms, and more on the buttercrust, and The Crustless, which amazingly has sausage replacing the crust. They form the sausage just like the crust, and it eats sort of like a sausage parmigiana. Incredibly good. All their pizzas taste fresh, and they use super sweet tomatoes. I love it.
