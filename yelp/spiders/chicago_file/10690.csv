Art Institute of Chicago////I really enjoyed this museum. There's so much to see! You can easily spend the entire day here if you enjoy art. Unfortunately, we spent only 3 hours here as we rushed to visit the "must see" arts. (My husband and son are not as appreciative as I am.) I'll just have to come back another time. BTW...CityPass is a great value for visitors, especially nice because you skip the general ticket line.
