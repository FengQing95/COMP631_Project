Little Goat Diner////I'm a fan of this place, though Girl and the Goat will still be my first love.  The hot crab dip is probably my favorite on the menu but the shrimp and cheesy grits is a very close second. The shrimp cocktail is a cool twist worth trying.  If you're a veggie there's definitely some options, which my wife thought was ok, but mentioned she probably wouldn't come back. But i on the other hand truly enjoyed it.  I also love the bottled soda selections... very "old school"  Get the choco taco for dessert.  They don't do reservations but if you have a small group (4 or less) it shouldn't be too bad of a wait.  The servers are great and very helpful are first time there.
