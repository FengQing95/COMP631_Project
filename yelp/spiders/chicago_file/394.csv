Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Fantastic breakfast menu and delightful wait staff! Had to wait for about 30 minutes but it is totally worth the wait. I had the garden skillet: full of fresh veggies and served over hash browns, cheese and eggs cooked to order. Came with two pancakes on the side--I got the pumpkin spice. Light, fluffy and delicious! Great prices for the huge amount of food you get. Don't miss this outstanding breakfast place!
