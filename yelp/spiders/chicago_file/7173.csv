Art Institute of Chicago////One of the many great offerings of Â this magnificent city. Its a must do whether you are an art lover or not. You can easily spend a whole day here, looking at art. I love their paintings section and it is a must see stop for any tourist in Chicago. I was here recently for the Picasso collection and it was incredible.
