Little Goat Diner////The menu had SO MANY options.  They did run out of Kimchee when we were there at like 7pm...which was a bummer.  The cheddar apple soup was AMAZING.  The fried pickle sandwich was gigantic but absolutely incredible.  And the blood orange pie?  Not too sweet and so delicious, we nearly licked the bowl.
