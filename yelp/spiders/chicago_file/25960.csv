Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The sauce was a little plain for us, being just crushed tomatoes. There may have been something else in there, but if there was it wasn't very noticeable.  We heard amazing things about LM's so we gave it a try. We're always excited  to try restaurants we've never eaten in, and this is no exception, but the pizza just wasn't to our liking.
