Little Goat Diner////So, as mentioned, great food... But service that was really lacking on a very basic level which really shouldn't be the case for how expensive it is. I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and say maybe we were just there on an off night, but, still, really weird given the reputation of the Goat restaurants.
