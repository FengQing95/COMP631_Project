Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Overall, if you're looking for top quality food in Chicago, you don't have to look very hard.  At these prices, I can get a steak at Joe's, Gibson's, Mastro's, etc. that is much, much better.  Not even a comparison.  If you want a drink and cool scene, check it out.  But for food, save your money for all the other amazing steakhouses in the city!
