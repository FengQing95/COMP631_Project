Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I went with 3 other people and half the group wasn't very hungry so we got a Medium with half of the classic and the other half the lou. Â It was almost the perfect amount for the four of us, but the pizza was so filling, we had to leave a piece. I could have been comfortable with only one slice, but I loved the lou slice so much I had to go for another. I felt as though the classic was a bit lacking in the flavor range but I think the guys liked the classic more than the lou. (go figure) So half and half was perfect for the group.
