Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Found this gem on Yelp and all that loved it were right to do so.  We sat and had drinks with friends before dinner.  Bar is nice and it had character,  which I love.  I had a mojito and my wife a sangria,  but were better than average.   In fact the sangria was off the hook.  We ended up getting a pitcher of it and than a pitcher of the raspberry sangria afterwards.   We started out with their appetizer plate and I highly recommend it.  $11 for 6 small bites.  Highlights were the stuffed date rolled in chorizo and the stuffed pepper.  For dinner they had a special pork belly and all I can say is I am hooked.
