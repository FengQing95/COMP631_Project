Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I felt like this place a little more hyped than it should be. I came in during the early afternoon and sat at the bar. I enjoyed a nice local beer and felt that they had a decent beer selection. I got a personal sized pizza that was suggested to me, I believe it's their most popular pizza (the Malnati classic?), and then I added jalape√±os (I'm a Texan who loves a good kick). The pizza was mediocre and bland in my opinion. I also may not be a fan of Chicago style pizza. The service was great but the food was blah.
