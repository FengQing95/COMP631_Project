The Purple Pig////Cool lunch spot in the heart of downtown Chicago... Plenty of seating with an indoor/ covered outdoor area as well.. Italian type restaurant, one thing I thought that was weird/ different is that they don't bring all the food out at once, whatever get done first in the kitchen comes out.. I ordered an seafood dish with mussels, shrimps, scallops in it. Really good, a lot of flavor, good portion for lunch time. It's directly across the street from the Intercontinental Hotel.
