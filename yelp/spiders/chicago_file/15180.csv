Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As for the whole restaurant experience, it was rough. Long lines: over an hour wait. And it didn't have a convenient bar (yes, there's a bar; it was packed three deep with Sox fans). We pre-ordered, which seemed like it was a good idea. We finally got our table in a very crowded, difficult-to-walk-through, hard-to-hear-yourself-think basement. It only took four requests to get a glass of water. And the wine list was mediocre.
