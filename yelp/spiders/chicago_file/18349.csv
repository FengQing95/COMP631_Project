Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came in to experience their deep dish pizza. not that crowded on a saturday afternoon. but man the wait for a pizza was sure long. I was surprised by the lack of fillings, was expecting it to be somewhat deeper. anyway, spent about 8 bucks for a personal size house special sausage pizza, wish there was more meat. oh well.
