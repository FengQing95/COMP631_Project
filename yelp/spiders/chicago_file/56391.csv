Smoque BBQ////I have never given a restaurant 5 stars, but this one deserves it. This has to be the BEST bbq place in Chicago/Northwest Suburbs. I am a huge fan of bqq and believe that this is as good as it gets (close to home anyway). The place is a little small and the line can get farely long but it is well worth the wait. There isnt much room to sit inside either and the tables are close together so get ready to sit next to someone you dont know.
