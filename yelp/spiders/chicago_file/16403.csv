Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The deep dish butter crust maybe the best thing I've ever eaten. We came to Chicago for a couple things. Trying the pizza definitely one of them. If you're a foodie looking to check this Chicago Classic I'd highly recommend coming here. I'll be devoting the next year or so trying to make something comparable.
