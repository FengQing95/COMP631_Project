Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great place for good tapas! I've been here many times and always loved coming back. Some of my favorites include patatas bravas, burrata, shrimps with garlic, fried calamari. I really loved their paella too. Also, you must try their pinxtos - which are nothing but really small snacks. Their bacon wrapped dates, deviled eggs, croquettes and crostini - all were delicious.
