Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Now, if you were the manager, who would you address first? The people who are already eating a pizza, of which they clearly could not recognize or care was their own OR the people who are sitting pizzaless, hungry, and annoyed at the situation? This manager opted for the first. Absolutely ridiculous. Said manager seemed confused as to what to do, and gave more attention to the the table who now had 2 total pizzas, versus my table with none. She went over to the family who received my pizza and apologized to them, even though it was clear that they were stuffing their faces anyways, and did not care. Her first interaction with my table was asking us, "Did you guys eat any of this one?" in regards to the pizza we incorrectly received. It was visible that we hadn't, and told her we hadn't, to which she replied, "Cool!" and then proceeded to give that family the pizza they originally ordered, in addition to ours. How rude! She then disappeared into the kitchen for several minutes. When she finally reemerged, she wondered out to tell us that they were making our pizza a top priority and jumping it in the line of orders. She didn't once apologize to us, and she acted annoyed at us, even though it wasn't our fault. Maybe she expected us to just accept the pizza we didn't order? Whatever the reason, the customer should come first, and this was not the priority of this manager.
