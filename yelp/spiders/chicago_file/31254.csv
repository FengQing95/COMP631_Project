Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza was very good! The crust was amazingly crunchy and definitely the highlight of the pizza. There is a thick layer of cheese, along with sausage and pizza sauce. I wish that it could have been a little warmer so the cheese would have been more gooey and maybe a little more sauce. The small was actually the perfect amount for 2 and we were incredibly stuffed afterwards.
