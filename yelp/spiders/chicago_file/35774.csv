Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The space is charming and the sides are delicious. But I can not recommend the steak -- or the service. My very pricy steak was seriously over-cooked, and when I brought this to the attention to my server she brought out her cellphone to shine a light on the meat and declare that she saw traces of pink. I understand that even the best kitchens will occasionally overcook a piece of meat, but this experience pretty much ruined the meal.
