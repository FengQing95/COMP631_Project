Little Goat Diner////I had the Kalbi Beef Ribs. Flavor was 10 out of 10. I am torn on an overall rating because I expected Â a short rib type plate but the meat came in small slivers and still on a very thinly sliced bone. It was a little inconvenient to eat with such small bones (I am sure I swallowed at least one) but after I Googled today, that is how Kalbi is served. I don't know if I can deduct points for my own ignorance but this dish would be at another level if it was short ribs and really tender boneless meat.
