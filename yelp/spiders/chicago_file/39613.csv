Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place is top notch dinning. I ordered oysters to start. East and west coast. Not a single piece of shell! Extremely clean and fresh. I preferred the west coast to the east, although both are worth a taste. For entree I ordered the traditional fillet mignon with the roasted garlic topper and Brussel sprouts and truffle Mac and cheese. Fillet was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I didn't even use the included sauce! Perfect with just the roasted garlic. The Mac and cheese was creamy and the charred cheese crust was really good textually. The brussel sprouts have really good flavor but are heavily charred (which can be kind of bitter) ask for a light char! I didn't and they were a bit too bitter for me but when I mentioned it Eric our waiter was sure to immediately fix our bill. Eric was extremely personable and a true pleasure during our dinner. Our champagne and water glasses stayed full. Amazing food , amazing atmosphere. Can't wait to return.
