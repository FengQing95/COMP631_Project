Little Goat Diner////Goat Burger, Patty Melt style: Terrible. Hockey puck of goat meat that was cooked for way too long. The bread was ill shaped compared to it and all the toppings kind of fell to the side as I attempted to eat the sandwich. Whatever bites I did get with everything at the same time were just okay.
