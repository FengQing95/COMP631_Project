Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Now I'm in Chicago and I wasn't sure what kind of Americanized tapas to expect. Although not authentic, I was happy to find the tapas at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba to be pretty damn good. The short ribs were tender and could be cut with a fork and the garlic shrimp were just as garlic-y as their Madrid counterparts.
