Little Goat Diner////I am a well travelled girl who has lived in over 5 countries, Dined in Michelin starred Â restaurants ( that's extremely fine dining Incase you didn't have any idea what that actually is!), and traveled to over 30 countries. It's a shame this discrimination from RACIST STAFF AT LITTLE GOAT overshadowed the whole experience for me now. Such an incredible shame to be shown up by a customer, when you say there are no seats available, and then to see they actually have space to accommodate us at a reasonable table with actual light to read a menu- ( is it strange for me a paying customer to actually want to SEE my food and menu to read in actual light?! Am I reaching for too much here at a normal restaurant?) to be shown to a nice well lit area - where clearly there were seats available all that time they didn't want two girls like us to be seated at?!
