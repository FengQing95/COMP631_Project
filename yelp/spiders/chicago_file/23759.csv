Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The best deep dish pizza in America.Not even a close 2nd. If you're in Chicago, they have 44 locations or so, and need to expand to other states (like California/NYC). This is the main tourist (Miracle Mile location), so wait will be an hour plus during peak times (expected), but it's prob best to go to another location which is basically the same dining option.
