Little Goat Diner////Food: After about a 40 min wait, we were seated in the stools, which were very uncomfortable. We got the machos nachos, fish tostadas, and Bahn Mi Style burger. The best part of the meal was the machos nachos. It was packed with flavor. I loved the pickled peppers! It was a surprising sweet flavor mixed with delicious fatty and buttery pulled pork. The sauce was an added bonus. The rest of the food left more to be desired. The fish tostadas didn't have a lot of flavor and were hard to eat. I love fish tacos and adding chickpeas to the mix only sounds good. I wish the fish was flakey and had more flavor. The bahn mi style burger was pretty good. It was much better on paper than it was in my stomach. It is hard to pinpoint exactly what was wrong as I am not an executive chef, but it was just lacking something to put it over the top. A delicious sauce or some fresh veggies would have done wonders. Overall, it was ok.
