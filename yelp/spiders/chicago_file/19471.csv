Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As a California girl one of the first things I wanted to do in Chicago was eat some famous deep dish pizza. With the help of my boyfriend we compounded a list of places based on reviews and suggestions from friends and family. We narrowed it down to Lou Malnati's, Giordano's and Pizano's I believe. Â Out of all three places Lou's hands down took the cake! What made it better was overall taste, the butter crust was insanely delicious and the toppings were so balanced. Service was also great, it was the only place where you could preorder the pizza while waiting for your table. Since each pizza takes 30-45 minutes to bake the preorder while you wait is genius for the hungry customer. Overall would highly recommend!
