Little Goat Diner////I feel like I give out a lot of 5 stars, and sometimes it's because I find the ambiance or the service or the aesthetic of the restaurant I'm reviewing to be particularly good and/or charming as well as the food. But this place deserves every one of my 5 stars for just the food alone. It's just an added bonus that the interior and the service are just as lovely as well.
