The Purple Pig////We keep track of our scores on each of the dishes, but some of our 10/10 dishes have been the Pork Secreto, Milk Braised Pork Shoulder, and Orecchiette. I would try ANY pasta dish on their menu because they are just all equally spectacular. The presentation of each dish is beautiful, if you can't tell from the pictures.
