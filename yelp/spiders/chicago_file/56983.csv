Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is my FAVORITE brunch place in Chicago! I try to stop here on every trip. You have to have their Bloody Mary bar. They have everything you could dream of for your Bloody Mary. When it comes to food, my best advice is to go with a group of people and have everyone order something different so you can try everything. This restaurant is always packed, but the service is still fast!
