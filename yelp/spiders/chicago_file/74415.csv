Little Goat Diner////The Food: Hashbrowns are freshly grated to order and come automatically with cheese (I got mine without, as a light breakfast eater) -- portion was huuuge and the hashbrowns were for some reason so long I had to twirl them like spaghetti around my fork! Â Breakfast was definitely fresh, yummy, and filling.
