Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Worth the wait! I endured a short 20 min wait with two restless kids who claimed it was the best breakfast they'd ever had. The Rutherford omelet was unique and delicious. The sausage was divine. The portions were more than generous and the service was spectacular. In town for only a few days but we will head back tomorrow.
