Smoque BBQ////Yowza, yowza, yowza!  Let me get this out there:  I looove barbeque!  I like crappy barbeque even.  What is there not to love about a rosy pink smoke ring, a crusty bark, juicy, succulent meat and a perfectly balanced sweet/sour accompaniment sauce?  (Yes, I am from the camp of bark bbq fans.)
