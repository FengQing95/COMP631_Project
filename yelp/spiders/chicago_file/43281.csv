Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love Ba-Ba-Reeba.  They're consistently tasty and have very generous portions for tapas.  I had a friend in town who was my roommate when I lived in Spain.  We ordered a cheese plate, a ham plate, olives, tortilla, bacon wrapped dates, albondigas (meatballs), and queso de cabra and were definitely not disappointed.  The traditional sangria is also pretty delicious.
