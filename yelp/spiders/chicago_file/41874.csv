Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba Reeba has been a tapas staple in Chicago for a very long time. Over the last five years this place has gone down the pipes. The last two times I have been here the service is minimal to non-existant. The food is awful, meats are typically over cooked and dried out, and the bread they put on the table is stale beyond belief and hard as a rock. They are typically very busy and to accommodate long waits they've begun using their outdoor patio as seating year-round with a tent. The tent makes the noise level sky rocket, and I had to yell across my two-top table at my date. Because the patio is technically outdoors, there was a freezing draft that blew through the place every ten minutes. I'm writing Cafe Ba Ba Reeba off for good.
