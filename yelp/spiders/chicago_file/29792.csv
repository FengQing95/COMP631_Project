Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Walked in and the wait was 30 minutes, luckily I spotted 2 seats at the bar so we opted to sit there. Started off with a Goose Island Green Line while Boyfriend went with a Goose Island IPA. We split an individual salad with red wine vinaigrette and ranch on the side. I personally enjoyed drizzling both dressings on my portion of the salad and thought that it was enough for two. For pizza we ordered The Malnati Chicago Classic, a size small. It comes with sausage so we added green peppers and onions. The pizza was FRICKING AWESOME!! I fell in LOVE with the buttercrust, it was so crispy which is just the way I like it.
