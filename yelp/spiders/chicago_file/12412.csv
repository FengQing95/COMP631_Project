Art Institute of Chicago////This place is truly world-class. Tips: join as a member and get in an hour early for an empty museum! I recommend breakfast down the street at Goddess and the Baker, then show up at 10 am for entry. So many incredible and famous pieces. Download the app and bring headphones for free audio tours!
