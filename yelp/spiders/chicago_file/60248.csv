Smoque BBQ////The sides really stole the show. The mac & cheese is probably the best I've had in Chicago (thus far); the beans have a rich smokiness and some pork mixed in; the slaw, although not creamy, was crispy and fresh; and the cobbler was deeeelicious with a thick, crispy crust and firm, fresh peaches. Overall, an awesome meal and I cannot wait to return for their pulled pork and Texas sausage.
