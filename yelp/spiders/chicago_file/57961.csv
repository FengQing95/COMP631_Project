Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////For food we tried a ton of tapas but I will touch on my favorites. My favorite tapa i tried that day was the goat cheese in tomato sauce. It comes with french bread with butter and herbs which perfectly complements the creaminess/sweetness of the cheese and tomato sauce. Next in line is the stuffed mushrooms. The flavor of the stuffing was creamy, salty, and crunchy---overall great appetizer. Rounding out my top three is the shrimp with olive oil and chili flake. There is nothing outwardly unique about this, but the flavor and the jumbo shrimp make this a GREAT option to appease anyone. We also ordered two types of Paella for the table: the seafood one and the meat one. Both were great, the meat was tender was flavorful, but overall this paella was a bit drier than the seafood. The seafood paella was moist and packed full of the most delicious seafood! Â For dessert we got the carmelized apple which was light and refreshing and the pistachios on top added the perfect crunch! I look forwards to trying many more tapas in the near future because this might just be my new spot!
