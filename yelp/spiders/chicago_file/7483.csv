Art Institute of Chicago////We were there at night, but I can imagine how stunning it is with the natural light streaming in. The works definitely poke at your sense of normality and hook you in. One amusing piece was a log constructed into a log that the artist admired while in California (only this one was made in Japan!) And I loved the pieces by Ellsworth Kelly...so happy the Art Institute can share them with us!
