Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Good coffee! Not that cheap-watery junk stuff they have at other places. The portions are gigantic; but hey, I guess all American breakfast places are that way. This may be a problem if you're a visitor like me, and have lots of touristy food travels planned but you still want to try the house specials. I've got a solution for you. If you're with a friend (or two) try ordering one of the non-pancake options that come with pancakes. Then pay a dollar extra to turn that side of pancakes into a specialty pancake-short stack. Someone else said this is an overhyped IHOP, not the case at all. NOT AT ALL!
