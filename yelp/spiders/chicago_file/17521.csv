Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm sure everyone has their opinion on which Chicago deep dish pizza is best, but I'm sorry Lou's by far takes the cake!!! The sausage tastes homemade and there is probably a pound of cheese on each pizza plus the sauce is fresh and uses diced tomatoes rather a paste/sauce like we experienced at other pizza joints. Being Italian it was seasoned perfectly!!! I would not even waste my time with another pizza place when I'm in Chicago!
