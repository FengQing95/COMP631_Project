Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place was highly recommended for deep dish pizza. It takes 40-45 mins to make so we started with the bruschetta appetizer, which was quite good - fresh cut tomatoes and basil on garlic bread. We had the Chicago classic deep dish with tomato, sausage and the butter crust but we were a bit disappointed....the tomato sauce and sausage was good, but there was so much thick cheese...not melted soft cheese but very thick mozza which I found difficult to eat. It wasn't bad but not mind blowing and maybe my expectations were too high. Overall there was good service and free wifi.
