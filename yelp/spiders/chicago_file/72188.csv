Little Goat Diner////Great food, but both myself and my man felt very rushed throughout the entire meal. I understand they were busy but we had made reservations for a reason and expect to be serviced properly. The hostess tried to be polite but everything she said was so rushed and really made me want to leave because I felt like we were bothering her by sitting in her booth.
