Little Goat Diner////Ho-lee-cow! This place serves up one hell of a meal. Stopped in for lunch with coworkers, immediately got a table, and ate more food than I care to admit. We all tried a little bit of eachother's dishes and nothing disappointed. The scallion pancake with pork belly was killer, and then goat chili cheese fries were gone in an instant.
