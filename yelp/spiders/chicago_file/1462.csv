Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Very busy and very quick service. Breakfast was great! Our party had French toast and several different types of omelettes. French toast was a bit sweet but perfect for those that like dessert for breakfast! We also sampled the cinnamon bun pancakes, blueberry and plain...all were very good! Great breakfast for marathon weekend =)
