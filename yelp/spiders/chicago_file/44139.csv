Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////After about 5 or 6 rounds of tapas we were served two different kinds of paella. We had a veggie version and a chicken/pork mix. The vegetable paella was great. It was earthy and warm with a strong mushroom undertone. The chicken and pork, however, was awful. The meat did not taste or smell appealing and the texture of the rice was odd, a little too dry.
