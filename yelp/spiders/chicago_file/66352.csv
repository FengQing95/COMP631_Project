Little Goat Diner////now i had the mezcal cocktail which was simply out of the world. it came with cherries n red syrup at the bottom but the whole thing was never syrupy sweet. just one perfect smoky balance. once again the goat chilli...had to have it. the pancake with pork belly, i expected better. so - don't go for that. the cookie pie - don't go for tht either. the dough on the outside seems too flaky n greasy.
