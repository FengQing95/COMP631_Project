Little Goat Diner////But the surprise winner of the night were their house-made matzo chips, which basically are just an accoutrement, or a vehicle to get the star of the dish from the plate to your mouth - but they are in my opinion a home run in every way. Get the choco-taco dessert (featuring chocolate-dipped matzo chips), and you'll see what I mean.
