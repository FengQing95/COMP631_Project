Little Goat Diner////Goat chili - I hate beans so obviously I am biased when I say I wasn't impressed, but my boyfriend loves chili and he still wasn't impressed. I think it was a little too sour. It was topped with lettuce (maybe) and sour cream. The one good thing I have to say about it is that there was a lot of meat in it.
