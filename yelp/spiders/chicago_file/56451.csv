Smoque BBQ////The barbecue was amazing.  Saucy and perfect. Every bit of the meat was sumptuous.  The fries were the best, tastiest, crunchiest fries I have ever had. The mac and cheese was fricking unreal. The damned beans were even good, and I usually won't even touch baked beans unless my mama made them. The slaw was great. The cobbler was fantastic.
