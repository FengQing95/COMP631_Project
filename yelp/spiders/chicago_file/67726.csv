Little Goat Diner////They don't take reservations, which is fine, except their (ostensibly) first-come-first-serve seating system appears inefficient; for instance: I didn't receive my "table's ready" SMS until I'd already returned to the restaurant from my pre-brunch beer at Haymarket, at which point it was about twenty-five minutes after their estimated window ended, but still about twenty minutes before a table was prepared and my small party seated, despite the text-message asserting otherwise. Â Furthermore: the wait-times are extravagant, and it doesn't really seem like the first-comes are necessarily first-served.
