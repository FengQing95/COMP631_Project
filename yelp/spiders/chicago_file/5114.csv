The Purple Pig////Way overrated for food and ambience. Feels like eating in a cafeteria  with the service to match.Food expensive and the portions are small.( One oz or less  bone marrow -$25). Pig ear is deep fried and taste like cicerone.Pig tongue -nothing special - Tastes like corned beef or pastrami.Small portions of food should come with small price.Calling it "Tapa style " is just a fancy way to overcharge, No plan to return.
