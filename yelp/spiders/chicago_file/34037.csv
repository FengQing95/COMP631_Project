Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For Alex the bartender: 8/21/14- some people that meet Alex and request a drink from Alex may describe him as a condescending pretentious p*****face. I'd like to give him the benefit of the doubt and describe him merely as condescending and pretentious. I made the mistake of requesting a drink with a base of grapefruit and vodka, add some muddled herbs or other flavors. Through the roll of Alex's eyes and body language I was left in no doubt how ridiculous and uncool my request was. Other than my experience with Alex, the rest of the staff at Bavettes were professional and made my dining experience pleasurable. The one star goes to my bar/ drink experience.
