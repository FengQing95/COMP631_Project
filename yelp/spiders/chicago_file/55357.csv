Smoque BBQ////Man, I wanted to love this place, but it's not that great. I came here with an empty tummy and I left with one. Now I may be a big guy, but when I eat I don't expect kiddy portions. I shouldn't have to order more food from this place when there are better joints round town. I don't eve feel like writing an extended review. Points below.
