Little Goat Diner////This elegant diner serves large, flavorful portions of comfort food. Â Love the laid back atmosphere and I thoroughly enjoyed the brandade & belly with eggs and biscuits - amazing flavors, perfectly complemented by the cool, spicy kick of kimchee. They also have a little bread shop next door, with a window into the workshop.
