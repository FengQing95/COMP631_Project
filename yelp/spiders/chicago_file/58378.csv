Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn't too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you've ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I'm just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food.
