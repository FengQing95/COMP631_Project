Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I know they're famous for their sangria but it didn't do a heck of a lot for me (then again, I'm not a big sangria person).  Their smoky mezcal cocktail, however, (and I drank enough of them that I can't remember the proper name) was a thing of beauty.  Containing a list of unlikely ingredients, this magical beverage had a bevy of interesting, complex and complimentary flavors.
