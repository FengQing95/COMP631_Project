Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Can't visit Chicago without trying an authentic Chicago deep dish pizza!! Researched for a good pizza spot and Lou malnati's kept coming up. So many locations, we happened to be close to this one. We had a medium size malnati classic. It was more than enough for two people. Came out perfect temp, hot, cheese melted perfectly, crust was delicious. Definitely comfort food! Great for any occasion!
