Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Have visited this place 4 times already and every experience has been great. Their steaks are cooked to perfection and the vibe of this place is excellent. Their BYOB policy is really great and it makes for an unforgettable evening. I've tried almost all their steaks and always have enjoyed it a lot. On my top 3 steak places in Chicago.
