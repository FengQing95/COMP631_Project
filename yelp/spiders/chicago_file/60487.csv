Smoque BBQ////5) Â GET THERE EARLY... got there at 6:30 on crisp fall night, we were pleasantly surprised that they were practically empty, though by the time we were finishing up a little after 7, the line grew and it was sooo busy ! I had wanted to try the cobbler but it is served warm so the only logical thing to do is order it after your done eating, but by that time I was not willing to wait in that line. Guess I will have to come back !
