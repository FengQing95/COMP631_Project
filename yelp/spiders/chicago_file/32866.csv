Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette is beef focused restaurant opened by the founders of Gilt Bar and Maude's Liquor bar (a fan of both!).  It should be noted that this was a soft opening of sorts.  I think this was maybe the second or third day this had been open to the public.  I recognized at least a few staff members from Gilt and Maude's. From the outside, no Gilt Bar awning to speak of, such that we went flying past the restaurant. There are two large arch windows.  The space inside is Gilt Bar esque, lots of exposed brick, dark with metal details.  It's a large space, very well spread out, with some bar seats towards the back of the bar.  The cocktails were great, as per the other two bars - a great Wellers 107 Old Fashioned, a Cognac Sazerac and single barrel Four roses (ok not technically a cocktail).  Overall, I'm definitely coming back (booking made already!).  There are a bunch of other dishes I'm keen to try - the lamb chops, the pork chops, the beef stroganoff.
