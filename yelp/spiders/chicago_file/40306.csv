Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We waited 3 months to grab our reservation here last year for my birthday around this time just to have it cancelled due to Covid. That's okay because we rather be safe and knew we will just come back here when things begin to open again. My wifey surprised me again this year by making reservations here for my birthday. Parking was plenty and very easy on a Thursday evening. Our server Barbara was super nice and wonderful. She was super attentive and made great recommendations. For starters, we had the Crab Cake, which was delicious. I had the Bone In Filet and my wife had the Bone In Ribeye. My filet was one of the best bone in filets I have ever tried. They made it perfectly to my liking. The wife's Ribeye was also amazing. We had 3 sides: mushrooms, elote, and brussel sprouts. Our favorite was definitely the brussel sprouts, but all 3 were very good. We ended the night with a mango sorbet that was a nice light dessert. Now, I can say this is one of my favorite restaurants and will come back again in the future!
