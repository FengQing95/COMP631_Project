Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I went here with my family for my parent's 33rd wedding anniversary and I was a bit disappointed. I definitely dug the Boardwalk Empire feel of the restaurant, and the service, drinks and appetizers was good, but two steaks came out well done, when they were ordered medium rare and rare. With all the great steak houses in Chicago, there are definitely a lot of Â better options.
