Little Goat Diner////I'm seriously a fan of Little Goat Diner.  The quality of their food is fantastic and the depth of flavor is unreal.  I had the goat burger banh mi style.  The sprouts made the entire burger very refreshing, and combined with the flavor from the mayo and pickled veggie, it was just a flavor bomb (in a great way).  I was very impressed from the first bite all the way to the last.
