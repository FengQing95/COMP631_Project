Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Salad was great. Loved the salad. Pizza was ok. Outdoor seating was nice until the sun moved so I got burned. Service was good but if you're going to go there to order pizza, it'll take 30-40 mins to get your pizza (doesn't matter if you get a small large) and it'll take longer than that if you go during a meal rush. Street paid parking is available but limited. Pricing was decent. I shared a medium sized pizza with 3 other people (one wasn't really hungry) with leftovers and it cost about 20 bucks for it.
