Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette seems to be the #1 critics choice steakhouse in the city. However, found Bavette to be a boring dining experience based on the menu and wine list (they do allow corkage). Bavette is an old school steakhouse with hipster-speakeasy ambience. Forget Bavette, pay a bit or lot more and go to RPM Steak.
