Little Goat Diner////My parathas burrito is fantastic!! It's so delicious I wish I could have one vey day. There are maybe a few too many peppers for my taste, but they give a good kick. He salad on top is spicy, but a good spicy, not a 'I wanna cry spicy'. Nice large portion. You'd be hard pressed to leave hungry if you manage to finish this dish. I loved the Indian bread. The whole thing was delicious. But it needed more guacamole. There was just a tiny dollop underneath the salad. It would have been nice to have more.
