The Purple Pig////For drinks my friends ordered wine while I went for the Vadermill hard cider that was on the menu. As our very knowledgeable and helpful server mentioned, the cider was much more dry that your typical cider, which I thought was delicious. The Purple Pig has a pretty extensive wine Â and cocktail menu as well, sure to please anyone.
