Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Somehow, some way I was lucky to get a reservation here after about a week of checking back and forth, I was told to make a reservation months in advance, we were only in Chicago three days but this was the best meal I've ever had, the food, the atmosphere, the drinks, service -not to mention the company too!
