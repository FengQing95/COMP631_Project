Little Goat Diner////I got a mimosa to drink bc hell i'm in vacation but was quite disappointed in how small it was :/ We got an order of the tempura mashed potatoes which I thought were very interesting, but I didn't quite get the craze in it. I suppose it's different but otherwise it didn't leave any impression on me. For entrees I got the Little Piggy from China and my friend got the Chicken and French toast and those dishes were totally worth it!! The bread and the runny egg and eat of the little piggy with all the seasoning and sauces were suuuuper yummy and the chicken and French toast was HUGE!! Good portions of meat that was delicious with fresh strawberries and we were surprised to find an over easy egg in the middle of the French toast! I also ordered a side of home made sausage because ... idk, why not?! And it was also very good, thick and juicy!! So I definitely wasn't disappointed with our entrees and would recommend either of those dishes.
