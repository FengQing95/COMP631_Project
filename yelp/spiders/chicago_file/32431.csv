Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We did get to eat the pizza later at about 11:30PM.  However, I am astonished at how terrible it was prepared.  The pizza was prepared with large chunks of tomato, hundreds of them.  I hate large chunks of tomato and only like tomato sauce.  The description on the menu says tomato sauce.  Some of the pizzas use sliced tomato; however, ours was described as sauce and not chunks of tomato.
