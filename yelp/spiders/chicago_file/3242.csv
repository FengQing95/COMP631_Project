The Purple Pig////Now on to food and drinks. Drinks, I ordered a sangria and my boyfriend order a drink called bitter end. As for food...we got the pork shoulder with mashed potatoes and homemade morcilla sausage and poached lobster tail. The pork shoulder basically melted in your mouth when you ate it. The morcilla sausage has a unique taste so for those not use to blood I wouldn't recommend it.
