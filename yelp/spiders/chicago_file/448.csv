Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////After a wonderful weekend in Chicago this was my families last stop on our restaurant tour, glad we did!! The Chorizo Eggs Benedict were sensational as were the Berry Bliss Pancakes. Hash Browns were cooked to perfection, My mother also had 2 of the Vanilla Latte's, couldn't get enough. The only negative is that we had to wait 40 min, but I must admit, it was worth the wait.
