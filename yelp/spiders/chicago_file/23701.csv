Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The Malnati Chicago Classic is definitely the way to go if you don't like your 'za weighed down by superfluous ingredients. Just cheese, sausage, and semi-sweet tomato sauce adorn the flaky buttercrust and it is all you ever need. The crust was by far my favorite part, not super doughy like other Chicago-style pizzas I've tried, with a tinge of buttery sweetness. One piece of pizza is never enough for this girl, but here, one is plenty. Take the rest home and enjoy the best pizza you've ever eaten for days to come!
