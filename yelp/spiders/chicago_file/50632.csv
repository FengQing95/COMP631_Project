Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I absolutely love Ba Ba Reeba, it's one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. It's great for a group of people because you get to try multiple things. The food always comes out pretty quickly and the house sangria is delicious. I recently tried the brunch there and was just as impressed. I highly recommend making a reservation because they do tend to get busy.
