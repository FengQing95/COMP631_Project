Smoque BBQ////Sides:  The fries are excellent and they give you a big-ass paper bag of them.  Forget ketchup--just dip them straight in the barbecue sauce.  The macaroni and cheese is small and...well, the only disappointment of the meal.  Too thin and not cheesy enough, and the cornmeal is a texture that I found unpleasant.  Oh well.  I loved the tangy, peppery cole slaw despite my general aversion to vinegar-based slaws.  I tried a bite of baked beans but they are too sweet for me.  Tone down the sugar and I would love them; they are interesting and close to greatness.
