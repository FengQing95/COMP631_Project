Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I thought I had died and gone to heaven. The Chicago Classic with the butter crust was the best pizza I have ever had. Period. No wonder they ship all over the country. I am def going to try this service as now I cannot live without it. The sauce is not too sweet and not overly saucy. Also the amount of cheese was just right. I do not like too much cheese on my pizza. We did try Giordanos' and yes, that was good too but it's the Lou's BUTTER CRUST that has me wanting more. We started off with the spinach and strawberry salad to get some "greens" in before the slice. Yes, very fresh and flavorful. We all only had one slice as it is filling. Â We had some left over to take back to our condo in Chicago and it was in the fridge for a day and one of our friends who had just come back from Giordanos' said the same thing that Lou's is better. It's the crust.......You can also get their wonderful pizza on
