Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The reason this place lost 2 stars for me was that the pizza came out on the colder side of lukewarm. We had ordered extra cheese and when the pie was cut, the cheese cut like a block. There was no stringy goodness as my slice detached from the rest of its comrades. That should've been a red flag.
