Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////What a great way to start off the first day in Chicago with this place! After a half hour walk to this place, I sat at the bar and the staff was courteous and attentive, even though it was packed and drink orders for drinks kept flying in. The pizza definitely took the 30 minutes, as promised on the menu but well worth it! Being a huge fan of my native New York style pizza, I really did enjoy this classic Chicago style pizza. The tomatoes were plump and sweet, the cheese was nice and gooey, but not overloading the whole masterpiece and the crust was just amazing! I got the personal size and that was all I needed to satisfy my craving! I may even go back to pick up their frozen pizza to take back home to NY.
