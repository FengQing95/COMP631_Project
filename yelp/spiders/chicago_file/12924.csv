Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The salad and pizza are five stars!  Their limited menu allows them to focus on getting the food right, and they have succeeded.  My only complaint was their weak wine selection.  Ten wines to choose from. Many different brand names, but all brands were owned or imported by Gallo.  The restaurant could certainly offer a higher quality wine selection, and therefore, command a higher price for a glass or bottle.  The restaurant goes to such effort to make good food, but is lazy when it comes to the wine list.  A missed opportunity for Lou Malnati's.
