Art Institute of Chicago////their selection is quite refreshing -- they have both monet's lily pads and a bunch of van gogh's i've never seen before. impressionism fans will be quite happy to come here! but also their contemporary and modern exhibits were a great treat, again because the descriptions made me appreciate the artist's thought process and uniqueness of message! without hurting my brain!
