Smoque BBQ////The food was just okay. Most of the meat we got (brisket) was fat. It was just okay for paying around $200 for 6 people (including tip). We have been here before but after this last experience, I don't think we will be back. The fries were dead and the brisket had too much fat. The cornbread was good and the staff is very helpful. The bbq sauce is also very good. We just didn't love the food.
