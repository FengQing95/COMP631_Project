Little Goat Diner////Finally got to check this off my list, and so happy I could! I went with a group of girlfriends and we were seated promptly when we checked in for our reservation. Our server was very nice and gave great recommendations, after saying everything on the menu was delicious. It was very hard to choose from the variety of options - from breakfast choices, to sandwiches, the blue plate specials.
