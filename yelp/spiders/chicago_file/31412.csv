Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If it was based on the deep dish pizza alone, Lou Malnati's would get a 3 for me. Despite this place being the OG and most popular deep dish spot in Chicago, I just wasn't too fond of it. For two, we ordered The Lou in small ($18.25) and the Trio of Dips and Pizza Chips ($10.50). I'd definitely recommend an appetizer since the deep dish takes about 45 minutes.
