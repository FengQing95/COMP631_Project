Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My initial reaction was that the sauce was very robust. There were whole tomatoes in the sauce, that I was very fond of. The cheese had that elasticity you look for when you pull it apart. The sausage was well seasoned and the inconsistency in size (as found in crumbled sausage), complemented the cohesiveness of the pizza, giving it that homemade feel. Also the crust was pretty crispy as well (I thought the abundance of sauce would've sogg-ified it)
