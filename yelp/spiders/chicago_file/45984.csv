Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The bathrooms, however, deserve .5 stars. I mean, come on Ba-Ba-Reeba. You've been in this location for years, pull in loads of money, are usually packed and yet, the bathrooms are constantly falling apart? I investigated both of the ladies' rooms last night and was appalled. I've seen better johns in dive bars or at McDonald's.
