Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've been here many times, and have never been disappointed.  Exactly how I like my pizza.  Delicious crust, great tomato flavor, fresh toppings...yum!  Worth the calories every time.  Their salad options are also good -- crisp and fresh with great toppings.  Oh and I almost forgot -- love the bruschetta -- very flavorful!
