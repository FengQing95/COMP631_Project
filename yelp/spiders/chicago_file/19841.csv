Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou's was my favorite of the two. You HAVE to get the butter crust. It wasn't overly flaky or dry. It was crispy and yet saturated in butter. It was amazing. The cheese oozed out and really melted in your mouth. The interior was nice wood architecture and tile. They had some cool jerseys that were signed and on the walls. Besides the food and the decor, the staff was all super nice. Every person was really friendly and made the visit really pleasant.
