Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've taken family in town here, first and second dates, and simply been here with friends. The staff is super friendly and the food is delicious! Great vegetarian option, strong drinks and always clean and tidy. The noise level is 4.5/5 very loud! The host stand is well-versed in large parties and reservations running late. Your entire party has to be present to be checked in, then you're grouped into another waiting area (near the bar!) to be seated once your table has been set and server is ready for you.
