Little Goat Diner////Really dissapointed. I mean, I know it's a diner, but it's a diner by an Internationally celebrated Chef, and especially if you're charging that much for gross frozen concentrated OJ, youR service should be of a higher caliber - TERRIBLE SERVICE.  The food was pretty good, but when you have 20 people on the clock when there is a half empty and no one bothers to see if I want some more coffee so I sit there with an empty cup: YOU GOT PROBLEMS!  They clearly all hate their jobs, nobody smiled... Not going to bother to ome back to this place...
