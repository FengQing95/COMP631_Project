Art Institute of Chicago////The AIC is huge - 2nd only in sheer acreage to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Fine Art of museums in the US. For first time visitors, the institute's map may be a bit confusing - my only real criticism of the place - but floor staff are plentiful, helpful, and knowledgeable.
