Little Goat Diner////Excellent unusual menu choices and superb service.  I have a food allergy and they had special menus and great recommendations for me.  The food was great and just enough without being too heavy or large.  I have always wanted to try this restaurant and I so glad I had the opportunity!  The Chocolate taco for dessert is beautiful and tasty.
