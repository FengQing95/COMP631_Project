Art Institute of Chicago////When we toured the rest of the museum we were awed by the beautiful Monets and O'Keefes and admired the religious paintings from over 1000 years ago! A personal favorite of mine were the miniature rooms in the lower level. The detail the artists put into their pieces is extraordinary!
