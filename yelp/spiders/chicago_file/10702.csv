Art Institute of Chicago////Thursday evenings, 5-8, is free for Illinois residents, bring ID just in case they ask.  If you have a bag you have to check it and it costs $1.  Special exhibits are usually an extra charge.  Easy to get to by public transportation!.  There are a couple lawn areas you could enjoy, some have outdoor art in them.
