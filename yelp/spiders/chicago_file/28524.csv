Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Welcome to the king of pizza in Chicago. So we were told expect to wait times in excess of 2 hours and I don't know how the time passed so fast but by preordering the pizza our food showed up. OMG was it amazing. We were told butter crust and it was the finest pizza we have eaten. Â I understand why Chicago folks like this place
