Smoque BBQ////I am not totally sure what the hype is.  It is a very small place, maybe 20 tables inside, and 10 more outside, with an inefficient ordering system that results in people waiting an hour to get in, so it looks way busier than it really is. The BBQ is good, but I didn't think it was wait in line for an hour good.  The portions are generous. The pulled pork and brisket were better than the ribs in our opinion.  The sauces and sides are heavy on the vinegar flavor.  The cornbread was very good.  For desert we ordered peach cobbler, which was ok, and a pecan bread pudding with caramel sauce which was very good (probably the best part of our dinner.)  The service was pretty good, with friendly staff.
