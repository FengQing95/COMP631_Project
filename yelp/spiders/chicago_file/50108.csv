Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My paella was depressingly tiny in comparison to the huge pans I had in Spain, but I wasn't too hungry so I guess it was okay. I also think the chef ran out of vegetables because I saw carrots in it when there weren't supposed to be...and it was missing green onions. My friend's shrimp was good, although she was disappointed in the portion size and lack of spiciness - hey, that's Spanish tapas and food in general.
