Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been here a few times and every time it has been great. Â This has become my go-to restaurant when I want some good food. I initially went because I had a Lettuce Entertain You gift card and this place was recommended by coworkers. If you use foursquare, they usually have deals going on for free items with checkin. We got a free pixtas platter which are tiny tapas items the first time we went.
