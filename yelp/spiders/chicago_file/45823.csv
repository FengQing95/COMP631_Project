Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We've been twice and it's my fault, been a few months and forgot to do a review. This time I didn't forget because one of the managers was so sweet and gracious - I believe her name was Jessica. There was confusion with the reso my husband made, not sure where the blame lies, but regardless, Jessica took care of our party of four. Not to mention it was madhouse busy. The food was excellent, starting with several appetizers. We made sure to order the seafood paella, but before that came, we made sure to get a pitcher of sangria at the table before it arrived. Really delicious combination! Service was attentive and courteous. Loud? You bet, but it's a fun sort of loud. If Jessica is there, she'll see you're done right.
