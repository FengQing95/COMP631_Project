Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Cafe Ba Ba Reeba.  Our waitress happened to be a Californian and a fellow alum of my undergrad school, and we chatted a bit.  She was really sweet and very attentive.  When we received the bill, my mom was given a $10 certificate for her next visit to Cafe Ba Ba Reeba--a Mother's Day promotion the restaurant was having.  I was informed that for Father's Day, the restaurant will be giving fathers a $25 certificate!
