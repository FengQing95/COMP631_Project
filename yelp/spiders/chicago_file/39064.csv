Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We loved it there so much that we went again on March 17th for our 9 year anniversary.  We called that same day not knowing if we could get in but they accommodated us. This time we went with my son (4 yrs old) and friend so it was 4 of us. Our waiter was John and he was spot on.  We ordered the burger, mac and cheese, elote corn, sweet potato, chips and fries and they threw in the dessert again! WOW!  They brought out the chocolate cream pie and salted caramel ice cream - so good! Our previous waiter even stopped by to say hello. So sweet of him!
