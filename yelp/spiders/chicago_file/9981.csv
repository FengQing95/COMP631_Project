Art Institute of Chicago////Stunning beaux arts structure built in 1892 for the World Expo, the Institute is home to art spanning many millennia, and its Impressionist/Post-Impressionist collection is almost as extensive as d'Orsay's (sorry you had those paintings stolen, and thanks again for the huge HUGE loan to SF's DeYoung!!)
