The Purple Pig////It's tucked away in a little corridor area between an overpass and a hotel. For a table of 2, I had to wait at 7:45pm for 45 minutes. However, there's a nice foyer area with heat lamps and chairs where one can enjoy a variety of drinks while you wait. And let me tell you, they have a MASSIVE selection. They are known for their pairing and they have a wine list from ALL over the world from prominent power house countries (France, wine country) to obscure cuts (like Bulgaria lol). I enjoyed a Spanish wine, which is my soft spot.
