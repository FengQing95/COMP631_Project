Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////ANYWAY, so yeah the bartender was real chill and great. My friend and I got the deep dish cheese (as pictured below). And sadly though, it kind of fell flat for me just like Giordano's did. I don't know what it is, but why does the pizza in Chicago taste so bland?! It lacks flavor, it lacks sooomething that I can't put my finger on but it's a something that doesn't make my tastebuds go DAMN THAT WAS NICE GIVE ME MORE. Tastier than Giordano's but less so than Pequod's which was still even a 3.5/5 for me. I don't know ya'll, but deep dish in general just isn't doing it for me!
