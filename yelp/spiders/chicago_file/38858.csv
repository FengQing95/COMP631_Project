Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Mentioned it reminded me of Au Cheval and apparently they are sisters. Started with east coast oysters which were perfect! Wish I ordered more. Baked goat cheese as well. Nothing insane but if you love this dish elsewhere I'm sure it stands up here too. Spilt a carb stuffed avocado salad. The dressing was light and didn't over power the tasty crab and avocado. I highly recommend this and splitting as well. I had the 6oz filet and my brother in law had the burger and beef fat fries. We spilt the wild mushrooms and mac and cheese.
