Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I saw on a couple reviews that it was mentioned this was a "chick place" and not a good place to bring a date.  I do not see that at all.  I think this is a great place to bring a date or go for a special occasion.  I was even in here once for dinner during the NFL playoffs and was probably the only guy seated out of all the tables there.  But it certainly did not bother me at all.  And anyway, it seems to me that if there are a lot of women in a place that would indicate a date would probably really enjoy it.
