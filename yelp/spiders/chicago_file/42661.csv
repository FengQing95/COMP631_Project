Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Seriously?  Our group of THREE just dropped nearly 100 dollars at your restaurant, and this is how we get treated?  I've had a great experience here before, which is why I'm holding off on just leaving one star, but I left full of mediocre food and a sour taste in my mouth at her complete lack of customer service.  Sorry, Ba-Ba-Reeba, it might be awhile before I'm back.
