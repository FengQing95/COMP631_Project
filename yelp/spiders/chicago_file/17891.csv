Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Unlike some restaurants in the Bay area like Zachary's and Little Star that boasts authentic deep dish, Lou Malnati's is the real deal. The mix of the tomatoes, spinach, and cheese was the perfect combo, with the mushrooms adding nice flavor to each bite as well. The crust was nice and soft, brown and golden on the outsides. I've always thought Chicago style pizza was just "whatever" after having slices of pizza COVERED in tomato sauce at Zachary's (I think imo doing this makes me stop at one slice because the tomato sauce is just too much for me). Lou's has changed it for me--it was not slathered with a huge later of tomato sauce. Instead, it was just the perfect balance of crust, cheese, and filling. Mmm. Give me more (or ship it to me! PLEASE?!)
