Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of my favorite restaurants in the city! Â Awesome food and service! I have tried almost everything on the menu and I've never been disappointed. Their peach sangria is delicious. A few of my favorite menu items are the steak, empanadas, and spicy potatoes. I get the bacon wrapped dates every time. I also love their stuffed mushrooms.
