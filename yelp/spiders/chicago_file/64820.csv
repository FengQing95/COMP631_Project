Smoque BBQ////Both were good, but brisket was slightly dry so I preferred the pulled pork a little more.  I liked that you had vinegar and hickory bbq sauces to choose from.  The sides really enhanced the experience for me.  The vingear based slaw was light and balanced out the meat.  However, favorite part of my meal was the mac and cheese - just the right amount of cheesiness, creaminess and baked with bread crumbs!
