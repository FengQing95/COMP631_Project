Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Portions are very reasonable. Before you know it, you're completely stuffed. I've tried a number of items on their menu. My three must haves here are the brussel sprout salad, tortilla espanola, and paella. The paella is huge and two servings was definitely more than enough for five of us. Unless the paella is your entree and you have no desire to try anything else on their menu, I would use 2-3 people per serving of paella as a guide.
