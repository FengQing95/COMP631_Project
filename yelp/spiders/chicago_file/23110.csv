Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Is it me or is a pizza supposed to have four specific things: dough, sauce, cheese, and whatever other crap you choose to put on your pie ("toppings"). Well, it was missing one very very vital thing! ...Sauce, sauce, where art thou?! It was seriously just dough, a massive amount of cheese, pepperoni, and GREASE. So much grease that I had to take napkins and soak it up in order to 'enjoy' a slice. [this was my second of all rant]
