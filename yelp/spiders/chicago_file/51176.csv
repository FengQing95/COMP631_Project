Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We sat on the very cute patio and our service sucked. It took TWO hours for lunch and we just wanted to get out of there so bad by the time we were finished but our waitress wasn't going to let that happen. She had the personality of a wet mop and couldn't manage to get any of our checks right.The manager stood by the computer for about 20 minutes trying to help her ( she still got it wrong when she brought the checks out) and neither one of them approached our table to apologize or explain the confusion. She couldn't even muster up a "sorry it took so long, have a nice day" by the end of it all. NOTHING. Very poor service and management.
