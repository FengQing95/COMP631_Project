The Purple Pig////*Pig Platter:  Our server advised us that this platter wouldn't be more than we could handle.  However, it was quite intimidating when it was set before us.  Ten types of meats along with two pickled sides were laid out on a behemoth wooden tray.  At first we were stunned, but as we slowly sample the meats, we discovered they were so thinly sliced that we weren't getting too stuffed.  Sad to say I can't name all the meats to save my life, but they were all good choices, and the platter was bare when it left the table.
