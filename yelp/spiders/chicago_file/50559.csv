Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My first time trying this place for brunch tapas and I thoroughly enjoyed it. My dining partner and I enjoyed the seasonal vegetable hash with a yummy poached egg and tarragon sauce, bacon mac'n'cheese, sausage fried paella, and the buttermilk waffle with banana. It was simply delicious even though some of the dishes lacked in a little seasoning. I also enjoyed a sangria with my brunch, which made it all the better. I would definitely suggest trying this place for brunch.
