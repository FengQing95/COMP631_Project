Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Best steak I've had in my life. On a work trip to the Chicago and in the mood for steak, I decided to stop here as it was only a few blocks from my hotel. Solo dining, I went straight to the bar downstairs. The place is dark with an early 20th century vibe. It would look like a romantic, intimate restaurant, but at the time I went (on a weekday night) it was quite crowded and loud.
