Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The staff was friendly and attentive and the pizza was sublime. Â It took about 30 minutes for our pizzas to arrive, but it was well worth the wait. I split a "small" "the Lou" with a friend and we were both satisfied. I'll be dropping by again next time I'm in the Windy City.
