Little Goat Diner////Did you know you can get married here?  You can, and it is awesome. It's a great restaurant and I think the other reviews can speak to that, but after attending a pig roast on the roof deck last summer, my then fiancee, now wife, and I decided we'd look into getting married in the event space upstairs.  The entire team we worked with were class acts and really went out of their way for us.  If I ever get married again, I'm doing it here.
