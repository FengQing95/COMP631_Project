Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went to this place for the first time just over a month ago and have already been back 2 times, thats how much i love it! The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because it can be a bit pricey. The last time I went I got the peach sangria and it was delicious! It didn't taste like a pound of sugar was just poured in with some alcohol and stirred around like most restaurants seem to do. I've had the chicken paella and the chicken and pork paella and both were very good. I preferred the chicken paella because it had more grilled veggies. I also really liked the grilled asparagus and cheese, the braised ribs and the spinach artichoke dip.
