Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Just FYI, this place gets packed around dinner time (we arrived right before the rush).  So there will be huge lines of people waiting, placing order and waiting for a table to open.  But this kinda works nicely cause you can grab drinks while you wait and by the time you get seated, the pizza will arrive and ready to eat.
