Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Loved the deep dish pizza here! it tasted so fresh and had great flavor. also loved that we could do half/half (sausage for hubby and spinach mushroom for me) on the pizza. Also, they have great salads and service was great. Would definitely go back (would have gone back if we had stated longer).
