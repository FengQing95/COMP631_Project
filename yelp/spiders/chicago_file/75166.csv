Little Goat Diner////I had ordered biscuts and gravy (breakfast all day!) with toast and gritz on the side. The gravy was a perfect tempurature, and the biscut was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Â The gritz was great, and by the time I got to the toast, I was pretty full. I could only eat one piece, but that one piece was fantastic.
