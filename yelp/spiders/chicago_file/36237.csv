Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////-EASILY SHAREABLE! My husband and I hardly ate all day and we split the Rib Eye and we couldn't finish it. We also split the baked potato. If you have questions about the menu, perfect! I am the type that usually knows what I want before I walk into fine dining restaurants but it was nice to gain knowledge about all the items on the menu from our waitress. She took time and was honest about certain pairings and dishes.
