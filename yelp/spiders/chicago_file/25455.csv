Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you are visiting Chicago, this is a must do. Awesome deep dish pizza. I ended up visiting on a Friday evening and had to wait 90 min to get in, but you can add you named to the wait list and they message you once they have a table available. If you have timed try bidding during lunch hours.
