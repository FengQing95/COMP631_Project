The Purple Pig////Some of the best things I have ever put in my mouth was at The Purple Pig restaurant in Chicago. This isn't just food, it's an experience. I'm convinced that each dish here is created by a magical culinary wizard that put countless though in everything cooked here. I had the pigs ear starter which gave my tastebuds a wonderful ride of flavors. Then came the milk braised pork shoulder... Best. Thing. In. The. World.
