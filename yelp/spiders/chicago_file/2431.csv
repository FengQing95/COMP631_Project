The Purple Pig////I sat at the end of the bar bc it was the only spot available unless I wanted to wait 15-20 mins for a shared table. The waiters/tresses picked up all drinks from the bar to my left, which wouldnt have been too bad if they didn't stand there and gossip. I learned all sorts of good stuff about the staff including who was actually good at pairing wine with food.
