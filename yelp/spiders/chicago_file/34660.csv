Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We had an absolutely wonderful experience that exceeded our expectations in so many ways. The atmosphere is incredible and makes you feel like you are thrown back into the "old Chicago." The food is some of the best (if not the best) I've ever had. We got the sweet potato, truffle Mac n cheese, broccoli, filet mignon, and chocolate creme pie at our table. There is no such thing as a basic side or dish here. Everything is special! Our favorite was the sweet potato.) Service was excellent. Happy we splurged here on our last day in Chicago. Will be back!
