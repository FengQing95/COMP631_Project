Little Goat Diner////Loved this place! Service was great and it was great "foodie" comfort food! Our party of 4 started out with the Bread of the Day which was Bacon Gouda. I seriously could have eaten this all night. We also ordered the crab dip served with Ritz crackers and it was perfect. Unlike Little Goat's sister restaurant, the main dishes are not tapas style. We each ordered a full entree for ourselves: Pork Belly Pancake, Tuna Melt, Grilled Cheese and the Skirt Steak and then a huge order of fries and Mac and Cheese for everyone to share. The portions were very generous and only my boyfriend was able to be a part of the Clean Plate Club. We all really liked we what we had ordered.
