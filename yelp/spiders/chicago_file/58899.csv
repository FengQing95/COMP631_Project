Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came for Happy Hour and it was exactly what we were looking for. Casual bar/dine-in spot with a good array of tapas for HH, but honestly their actual menu is very adorable. Was able to watch the college football game while enjoying bites that are several steps up from typical bar food.
