Little Goat Diner////I visited The Little Goat Diner this past weekend with some friends who live in Chicago.  Apparently, this is the sister restaurant of the Girl and the Goat.  We showed up for an afternoon lunch and were quickly seated at the communal table in the middle of the restaurant.  This place has a great atmosphere, plenty of light and really unique decorations all around.  I love the open kitchen concept and wish more places would accentuate this area since in every restaurant the food is the most important part!
