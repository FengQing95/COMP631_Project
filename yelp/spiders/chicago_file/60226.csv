Smoque BBQ////Not bad. Probably one of the best in Chicago, actually. It's just that there AREN'T many good BBQ joints in Chicago. They just can't quite find the right mix. Case in point: Smoque. GREAT meat. Quality, in that it's actually smoked everyday, and the aroma of the place brings you to your knees. But their sauce? Not for me. Perhaps I'm spoiled by having lived near Texas for a few years, but there should be a little more natural flavor to the sauce. Oh, and my ribs were cold and the brisket was stringy. I can't fault the pink and grey, though! They know what they're doing with slow smoking the meats.
