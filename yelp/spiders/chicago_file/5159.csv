The Purple Pig////Came here on Tuesday for dinner (5:00) and had no wait for a party of two! The waiter recommended around two plates per person, so we decided to get two meat dishes, a veggie, and seafood dish. My favorite was definitely the bone marrow! The dishes were a lot bigger than expected, so we were stuffed after 3! We got the bone marrow, milk braised shoulder, calamari, and salted beets. My favorite was definitely the bone marrow; the balance of fresh onion/veggies with the rich marrow was amaazing! Our waiter was also SO wonderful, and overall the experience was great but it IS quite pricey.
