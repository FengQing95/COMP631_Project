Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////When I'm Chicago there's two places I personally can recommend for authentic spanish tapas. One has drunken clams to live for, that'll always get you coming back for and the other is cafe babareeba might have spelled it incorrectly but the whimsical name will definitely get you to remember it when searching through random restaurant algorithms however you search for your own restaurants. It took me three or four times traveling to Chicago to finally be able to try this place out. And boy was I glad I had an opportunity. A fellow foodie friend asked what we should do to fill out our random trip with. I suggested Greek or Spanish tapas since goodness gracious who knows how long we'll be on the no fly list to Europe. I always attempt to scope out places that really attempt to transport you to a different city within the city you are visiting. Yes repeat visits won't be the same as your first one but we tried so many great dishes and random takes on dishes that most dishes were wonderful amongst the three musketeers. I'll post a few pics to hopefully get your appetite watering to attempt to try. If you found my review helpful, send a tip or pay it fwd. Help wonderful places like these stay part awesome. My only experiences in Spain are visits to places like Madrid and Barcelona each within their own city borders which have different dialects and cultural histories. Get to know your server and if time allows hear their stories from this great region in Europe. Tata for now... Have fun on your food adventures.
