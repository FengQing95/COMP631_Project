Smoque BBQ////Was here last week with the family. It was probably my 50th time there. BEST BBQ IN CHICAGO. Everything there is good but I'm hooked on the ribs (Baby back or St. Louis style, does not matter). It's not a fancy dining establishment if you choose to eat there but that's not why we go. My favorite sides are the Mac and Cheese and glazed apples. I highly recommend this place!
