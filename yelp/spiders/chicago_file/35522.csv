Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////* Beef Tongue. Ok this was excellent. Extremely tender and well-seasoned, this dish was solid and we all loved it. It came with small potatoes which were roasted to near perfection. Not much more to say about this dish, other than it was most excellent. Would highly recommend. I guess Chicago does meat well.
