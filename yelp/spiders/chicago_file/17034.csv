Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Some tips are to remember this pizza is filling!  I split it with one other person and we only consumed 3 slices all together.  This was do in part because we had cheesy bread as an appetizer, which was okay.  You're better off skipping the appetizer all together and just get the pizza.  It's definitely worth the wait!
