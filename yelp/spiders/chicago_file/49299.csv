Smoque BBQ////I went with the full slab of St. Louis and they literally fell off the bone.  They are very proud of their BBQ sauce and I can see why.  I also had a side of Mac n Cheese and that blew me away.  I absolutely love cheese and love to try Mac n Cheese wherever I go.  The only downside to the mac n cheese was the tiny portion.
