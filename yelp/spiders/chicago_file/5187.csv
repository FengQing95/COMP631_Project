The Purple Pig////I had an old fashioned to drink, which was definitely on the strong side, but no complaints here. My favorite dish was the sweet potato polenta because the blend of flavors was sheer nirvana. The milk-braised pork shoulder is also fantastic and basically falls apart as soon as you dive in. I did order the broccoli but thought the portion was way too big in comparison to the sizes of the other dishes. Definite broccoli overkill--I'd try the beets next time. The desserts are all pretty darn godly. Looking forward to my next visit!
