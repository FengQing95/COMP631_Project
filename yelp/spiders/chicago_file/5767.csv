The Purple Pig////With its sit-down ambiance and meat-forward menu, The Purple Pig was not really on my radar until a couple of weeks ago when I noticed the chalkboard signs for take-out drinks and tacos. Sold! I spontaneously stopped in here last Friday for carry-out. As other reviewers mentioned, the restaurant is located in the space formerly occupied by Corner Bakery. It was awesome to see the transformation and I had fun looking around at the wine-related quotes on the walls as my order was being prepared. The day I visited, the carryout drink specials were an aperol spritz and a house red wine, both for $10. I probably would opt for the aperol spritz, or other creative cocktail, next time around. The tacos were awesome. I went with the carnitas and highly recommend. The pork was expertly braised, without any fatty parts. A steal at $9 for two tacos, both a bit larger than street taco size.
