Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////You have to try the Lou Malnati's house special salad!!!! Their dressing is so amazing! It's like apples and bacon, perfect! The pizza is delicious! Chicago is known for deep dish, but their thin crust is good! If you are in Chicago, Lou Malnati's is the pizza place to be! :-)
