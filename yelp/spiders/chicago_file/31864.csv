Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////One word: redemption.  While in town recently, I realized that a friend (that was leaving in mere hours) had never had Chicago pizza.  That just wouldn't do.  Based on where we were and how much time before she scooted out of town, we made our way to Lou Malnati's.  Funny thing is that I didn't even remember that this is where I'd had a less than stellar pizza pie experience.
