Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////A great tapas restaurant.  It has nice outdoor seating that can allow you to enjoy the evenings in the summer.  The food here is really great and reasonably priced.  In typical tapas form, you have a lot of opportunities to try different dishes and taste a little bit of everything.
