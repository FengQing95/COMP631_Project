Smoque BBQ////I don't think I had ever eaten sliced beef brisket before in my life.  But my dad insisted that it is the best, so I ordered it.  I inhaled the entire sandwich (after carefully adding their tangy, tasty sauce).  The brisket was very nearly as soft and chewy as the bun that surrounded it.  Incredible flavor.  We also ordered the mac & cheese on the side, and loved it.  The small side order of mac & cheese is not big at all, so don't plan to be all "healthy" and share it... get your own!!   It is very close to the highway, so it was very easy to pick up my order to go.  You MUST go here.
