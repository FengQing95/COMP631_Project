Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been going here for 25 years.  One of the original tapas restaurants.  Food is always fresh and the service is always great.  From the patatas bravas, to the croquetas - everything is fresh and flavorful.  This is a long standing establishment and is located in Lincoln Park. Given its tenure and how they do tapas, which is very traditional - there is usually a very long wait.  Please go during a slight off hour if you are eager to eat; otherwise you can anticipate a long wait - but there is a bar inside the restaurant which will serve up your favorite sangria to keep you cool as you wait for your table.
