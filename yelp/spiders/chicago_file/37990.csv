Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Thoughts: The steak was perfect and definitely enough for the both of us. I also really appreciated that they cut the steak for us in the back after we asked. The frites were solid, but it was the garlic aioli which took the frites to the next level. We were not huge fans of the mashed potatoes because they had some sweetness to them and that's just not our thing.
