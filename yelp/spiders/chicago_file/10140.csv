Art Institute of Chicago////If you've never been-check out the Impressionism galleries on the top floor past the entrance. The Art Institute's collection of Renoir, Monet, Seurat, etc--is impressive. The way these rooms are laid out is beautiful. My favorite room in the whole museum is the gallery full of Haystacks and bridge paintings by Monet.
