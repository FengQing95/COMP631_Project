Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Of the few pizza places I've been to in Chicago, this was the best. Went there with my wife & two kids. The Chicago style deep dish pepperoni pizza was fabulous! Watch the portions though, I usually eat 3-4 pieces of pizza but it was all I could muster to squeeze down 2 of the huge pieces.
