Little Goat Diner////The first time I had Los Drowned and it was mouth watering!  The second time I wasn't feeling well that day, so I just had a cup of the chili, but it was really delicious.  my Dad had the sloppy goat--it was good, I thought it'd be different, not sure how, but just different.  It needed something I felt.
