Little Goat Diner////He dropped off menus - never welcoming us or even asking if we would like a drink or coffee. He came over 5 minutes later and said he was ready to take our food order. We ordered, a runner delivers the food, and JP dropped off the check. Oh ya he flew by once after I put the first spoonful of hash browns in my mouth and asked if we needed anything.  He did not even break stride and wait for my response.  I normally tip 50% at breakfast because it is just as hard as dinner and costs a lot less.  Well, JP got my 15%. I'm pretty sure he could care less.
