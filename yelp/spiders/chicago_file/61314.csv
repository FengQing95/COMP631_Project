Smoque BBQ////The meat is 5 star, the sides are 4 star, and the ambience 3 star. The Cole slaw is too simple, the Mac n cheese only decent. The BBQ beans were very good. BUT THE MEAT! The meat was incredible. My husband and I got the brisket and the St. Louis ribs, and we shared. Both meats were incrwdibke?! They were both smoky and moist, and Crazy tender. A little work on the sides and size of the place, and this could easily be a 5-star place.
