Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place came recommended to us and, as pizza lovers, we knew we had to try it... we are so glad we did! We ordered the classic deep dish for delivery and it was sooo delicious.  Perfect amount of cheese and sauce. We had two slices leftover and wrapped them in aluminum foil and brought them back home on the plane.  Just as tasty when we heated up in the oven. Definitely make a stop here if you are in the area and want some authentic Chicago deep dish.
