Smoque BBQ////Da server was awesum I shold a got his name.  He brought tree trays of da food & had da slab cut up into individual ribs so we didn't have to do it at the table.  He was always nearby if we needed anything & cleared the trays as we finished.  As always excellent food & service @ Smoque
