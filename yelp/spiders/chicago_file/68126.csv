Little Goat Diner////This place stands out for me among the restaurants in the West Loop. The food is as good as it gets with an atmosphere mixed with the staff is laid back and comfortable. They have a vegan menu that (thank god) boasts more than your average short list of tofu/meat substitutes and french fries but rather serves up fresh, delicious plates that just happen to be vegan. I leave stuffed every time.
