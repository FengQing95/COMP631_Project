Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've been looking forward to this visit for weeks. My pizza came in the time it was promised and it wasn't cold nor was it hot. it was somewhere in the middle and made me feel pressured to eat it quickly before the cheese became rubber. How long do these things stay in the oven? I'll try out Pepuod's next time to see how they do.
