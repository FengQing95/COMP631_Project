Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////REGARDING DELIVERY - Well...I'm still giving Lou's 5 stars because well it's the best deep dish in the country.  But the delivery of this Chicago Icon does require some PCR - Pizza Crisping Rehabilitation.  I wouldn't recommend the pre baked because unless you have a commercial oven - it's not the same as their blast furnace pizza ovens.
