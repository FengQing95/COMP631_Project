Little Goat Diner////What really wowed me today is how accommodating the staff was when we brought in two toddlers. They have high chairs (this may seem like a no brainer but we've been to a few places lately that don't). All thee people that were working stopped and said hello to the kids when they waved. The restaurant was packed and people were waiting for tables and everyone that walked by was so incredibly kind to not be so rushed that they couldn't say hello.
