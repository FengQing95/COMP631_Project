Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Have been a few times times for "real dinner" but went for burger club last night and sat at the bar. The staff could easily have not cared much because we only ordered burgers and no drinks but they treated us as if we had ordered a seafood tower and an expensive bottle of wine. Michael who was behind the bar was especially awesome/fun and even brought out some great salted caramel ice cream for us at the end. The burger was good, however, I do remember it being one large juicy patty in the past which was epic. This time it seemed very similar to the Au Cheval burger. All of the main dishes and sides are great and would highly recommend.
