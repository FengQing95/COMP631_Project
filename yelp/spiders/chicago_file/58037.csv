Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is a very unique place. It's a Spanish tapas restaurant, meaning you have to order quite a few small dishes that you usually share amongst the table. As a party of 5, we ordered a lot of food and everything was delicious. All the food comes out as it is prepared, not all at once like a standard restaurant.
