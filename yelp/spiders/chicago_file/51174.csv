Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Absolutely shocked this place does not have 5 stars. THE most delicious and satisfying meal I've had since moving to the area. I recommend making a reservation as this place fills up even though there are tons of tables. The tapas style food was absolutely incredible, with a variety of dishes and paella you surely will love. We also ordered a pitcher of the white, blackberry sangria, which was great for a hot summer day in Chicago. Will definitely be back.
