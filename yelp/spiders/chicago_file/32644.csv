Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The biggest letdown was the crab cake. Simply stated as baked & "Royal Lump" I expected to be wowed for nineteen bucks. I've enjoyed crab cakes all over Chicagoland, East Coast, etc, so this was going to be the finale of my night & I couldn't wait! I'm not sure if there really is a designation for "royal" crabmeat or that's just their own description like "Cheeseburger Royale" kinda thing. But I figured that if there was such a class of crabmeat, then it must trump Jumbo or Colossal Lump crabmeat. The cake was the size of a hockey puck, so it seemed properly portioned, like other good restaurants, but it all ended there. If the kitchen is using an expensive crabmeat for the cake as the price would dictate, someone back there must have taken all of the delicate lumps & beat the hell out of it all til it looked like the cheap claw meat you buy at Jewel. But for $19.00, this cake should have been flawless! Sorry kitchen, go have one at Joe's or any of the great seafood or steak houses in town and see that crab is the star of a really good crab cake.
