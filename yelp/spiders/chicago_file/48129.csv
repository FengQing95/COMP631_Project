Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I'd never been here before tonight but it had been recommended by friends many times.  My boyfriend and I went there for dinner and had the apple cider sangria, garlic potato salad, the short rib and the chicken paella.  Not only was the food fantastic, but the service was out of this world.  Josh A. went above and beyond to make our experience top notch giving opinions on options when we asked.
