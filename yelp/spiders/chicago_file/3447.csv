The Purple Pig////A couple next to me ordered a personalized charcuterie and some wine... they know what's up. Too bad my boyfriend and I didn't have time for all of that. The prices were what you would expect to spend at a trendy brunch restaurant and well worth it. The food is tapas style and you can just keep ordering.
