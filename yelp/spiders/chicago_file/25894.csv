Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Chicago's BEST deep dish pizza.  No more need be said about that... As for the dine-in experience it is always good. The staff must like their jobs because I've never had a bad experience.  My only complaint is that I feel that the restaurant is a bit too brightly lit for a pizza joint.
