Smoque BBQ////Ya know I am SHOCKED that I haven't done a review on Smoque!!! My wife have been here SO much, that we were going there BEFORE we got married!!... The Brisquet is so tender. the ribs are wonderful, and flavorful. Their sides are a bit small, but I can live with that. I wish it weren't so far away :-( Â  Maybe it's for the best. That way I won't be able to walk in ANYTIME I'd want some good BBQ. :-)
