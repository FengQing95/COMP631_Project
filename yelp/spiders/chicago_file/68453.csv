Little Goat Diner////The soup was creamy and hot and delicious.  It even had little pumpkin seeds and a lovely garnish of heavy cream!  My fish tostadas were equally yummy.  The fish was cooked well, topped with a light cabbage slaw that had just enough zing and the tostadas were crispy-crunchy and never lost their texture.
