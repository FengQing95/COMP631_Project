Art Institute of Chicago////There's a reason that The Art Institute is considered one of the greatest museums in the world. Chicago, and it's Gilded Age aristocrats, were world leaders in American culture and the art scene. Thanks to benefactors like Bertha Palmer, we have some of the grandest Impressionist work outside of Paris. You could spend weeks here viewing art from all around the world in different mediums. There truly is something for everyone. There's special tours if you're limited on time, just ask for the brochure or look it up online. It helps you hit the MUST SEES in a short amount of time.
