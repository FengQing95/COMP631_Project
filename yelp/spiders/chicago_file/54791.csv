Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have never been able to get into this place but I'm giving it 4 stars alone strictly based off of the incredible smells and atmosphere this place this restaurant has to offer! Every time my friends and I stumble upon this place and try to get in it's at least a 2+ hour wait (but it's gotta be worth it) some day very soon I'll eat here and write an updated review. Until then keep doin you Cafe Ba-Ba-Reba!
