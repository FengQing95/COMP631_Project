Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place does Spanish tapas right! With its moody Spanish atmosphere, big pitchers of sangria (from the tap), and delicious and fairly priced tapas, this place has become a new favorite for me. I went to this place for Happy hour with a friend and this was a great move as pitchers of sangria were 16$ (probably 6 glasses per pitcher) and they had about 10 amazing tapas on their HH menu that ranged from about 2-5 in price. We ordered the bacon wrapped dates (yes-do get), the beef empanadas (also yum), the patatas bravas (simple but done well and served with a delicious aioli) and the Spanish tomato bread with manchego (good but nothing special). We also ordered the garlic shrimp and the goat cheese in tomato sauce with bread. The goat cheese dish was recommended to me and though it was tasty, I didn't find it to be anything that special- also could have been that I was pretty full at that point .
