Art Institute of Chicago////The nice thing about it is it's huge. Though the bad thing about it is that it's huge. It is really, really hard to find your way around. For my boyfriend and I it was annoying at first because we wanted to find a certain section and couldn't figure it out. It became less annoying when we just slowed down and accepted we would never find it and walked through random exhibits.
