Art Institute of Chicago////Aside from that Picasso there are many other cool pieces that the museum has.  There are a wide array of American pieces by O'Keefe, Hopper, Cassatt, Sargent, and many others.  The museum also has a large collection of European paintings both Impressionist and Post Impressionist.  One of the more widely known paintings in the collection was the one that was oddly enough featured in the movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off, the Seurat titled Sunday Afternoon on La Grande Jatte.  One of my friends talked about how excited she was to see this painting all day.  It is huge, much larger than it appears in the movie.  Perhaps the most famous painting of them all though is American Gothic by Wood.  The crowd around that painting was hilarious, I could tell that I was in the Midwest!  You could barely see the painting the crowd was so thick.  The Chagall window is worth mentioning because the colors that he used to create the window took my breath away.
