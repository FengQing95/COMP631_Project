Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place has the best steak I have had in a few years. The 60 day dry aged bone in rib eye is to die for. Get it with some creamed spinach, brussels sprouts, and mashed potatoes, and you will be in heaven. Also, be sure to get the bone marrow. The onion jam and the bread make it amazing. I could eat their bread all day. Make sure to ask for a basket of bread and butter. I personally don't like old man booze, but if you like old fashioneds, they make good ones here according to my husband.
