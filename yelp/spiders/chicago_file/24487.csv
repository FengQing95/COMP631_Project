Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs. We ordered the garlic bread appetizer and a medium Malnati's Classic. We had more than enough food for 2 people. Despite our waitress warning us that the pizza usually serves 4 people, we figured we were that hungry. The garlic bread good as greasy, but tomato dipping sauce helped even it all out. The pizza was absolutely delicious and best eaten warm with the ooey-gooey cheese spilling over. I wished we ordered a salad, just so we would feel better about our gluttony.
