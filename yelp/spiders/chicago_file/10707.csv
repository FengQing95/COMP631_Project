Art Institute of Chicago////The museum is like a maze. Grab the map and plan before walking the museum. I suggest you hit the impressionist first before the crowd got in. The miniature room is great for kids. Love the vast space for the modernist. The art institute, smithsonian art museum and Philadelphia art museum are now my favorites in the U.S. Â They are still a long way to match the Louvre.
