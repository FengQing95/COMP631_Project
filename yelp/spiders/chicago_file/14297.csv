Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We each ordered an individual Deep Dish Pizza with Lou's famous butter crust - I ordered the Lou and Carol the Classic Chicago.  We split a medium Malnati Salad.  Salad was very good with fresh crisp lettuce and a nice variety of toppings.  The dressing was excellent and had a sweet taste to it.  The Pizzas were phenomenal and the Butter Crust really gave them a great flavor. For Dessert, we tried the Chocolate Chip Cookie Pizza - a deep dish pan with a homemade chocolate chip cookie topped with Vanilla Ice Cream and Whipped Cream.  Very Nice!  The only negative I can give it was that it had too much Whipped Cream on it.
