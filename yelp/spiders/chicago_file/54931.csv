Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Drunkness aside. The food was FANTASTIC imho. Anchovies topped with an olive tapenade paired well with the complimentary bread and evoo. Toasty catalan tomato bread topped with arugula and Manchego cheese triangles was delicious. The meatballs with sherry tomato sauce was simply divine as I sopped up the sauce with bread. If you go, the charcuterie plate (plato de la casa) is a must if you're a cured meat lover. We also ordered a breakfast paella which took about 30 minutes and was served sizzling hot table side. Well worth the wait. The bomba rice was perfectly cooked and I loved the crispy rice bits. The bill for 2 was about $100 w/tips, but we dined like a king and queen.
