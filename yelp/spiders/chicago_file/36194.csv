Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Visited Chicago for the first time and made a reservation two months in advance. This place definitely did not disappoint. The drinks were incredible, the steak melts in your mouth, the Mac and cheese was hands down the best I ever had and to top is off the dessert was phenomenal. I was so impressed with this place. Not to mention the ambiance is great, it's quiet and peaceful and romantic! I definitely recommend this steakhouse for anyone looking for a great meal in a beautiful restaurant!
