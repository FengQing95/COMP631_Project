The Purple Pig////One of the most amazing experiences! The ambiance was perfect, and the dishes were executed in an innovative fashion. Each dish is shareable, and what a better way then to enhance the romance on our anniversary. The servers are not constantly interrupting your experience. Their approach was perfect. Set down the dish and tell us about it if need be, let us observe the dish and taste it while watching from afar to see our reactions, reapproach and inquire how the dish is and if we need anything and then leave us to finish before the next comes out. All the dishes are served one at a time so not to get cold or warm while sitting. This allows the chef to prepare and serve the dish in the way it was intended to be experienced. Also this allows for each guest to not be overwhelmed by all of the dishes.
