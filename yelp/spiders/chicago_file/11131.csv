Art Institute of Chicago////The art institute is an amazing art museum that I recommend checking out. Great for dates, solo trips for inspiration, or just a day in Chicago. I come here often for free as a DePaul student. Â Appreciate the inclusion of a Takashi Murakami piece and the numerous paintings that are famous across the world. I remember learning about dozens of the paintings here throughout middle school and its really cool to actually see them years later!
