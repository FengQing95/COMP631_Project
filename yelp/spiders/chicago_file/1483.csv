Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Its a long waiting time on the weekend mornings. Almost 2 hour wait time. But rest assured, its just regular American breakfast. There is nothing in the omlette or pancake here that u wouldnt find elsewhere to be waiting 2 hours for. I like to try different places, so it was on my list of things to do in Chicago, but I wouldnt go back here if I have to wait absurd times in line. You will not miss much if you do not go here!
