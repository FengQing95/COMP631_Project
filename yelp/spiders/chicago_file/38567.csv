Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great night!! I loved my evening there so much and my BF who was tired and a little apprehensive of a fancy night out, said within 15 minutes of us being seated, he was so glad we came. He agrees, and we have hit all the biggies in the city, Gibson's, Maple & Ash, Chicago Cut and Swift and Sons ( which we both love) but Bavettes actually left all of them including S&S and CC in the dust. I love you Bavettes!! Get ready to see me lots!!
