Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The food is good and it matches the hype. However, the service can be much better. We were told 30 minutes. We ended up waiting 45 minutes. When we saw others going ahead of us, we talked to the hostess. She said 2 tables more to go. After 6 other groups went ahead of us, we talked to the manager. We were at 55 mins. I told them you can't tell time...He shrugged is shoulders like "what's the big deal"....I think they are too popular to care.
