Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I came here for my birthday, which is Christmas Eve. I was surprised that they were open and taking reservations for this day but happy at the same time because I had a place to go for my birthday, I'm usually unlucky with finding a restaurant to celebrate my birthday at since most of the ones I want to try out happen to be closed. I had been thinking about Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba ever since I read reviews about it here on Yelp. It was a different experience, the food was delicious for the most part. I was kind of let down with the tomato bread, because it sounded so delicious UNTIL we received it. I was thinking something more...exotic and different, and I wasn't the only one thinking this way at my table. I also thought some other food were American-ized, like some of the sauces and tastes. Raspberry Sangria was also a let-down since it tasted like iced-water with just a hint of raspberry flavor, so after a pitcher of that, we decided to give the regular Sangria a try, which tasted a whole lot better. Overall I would like to check out this place for breakfast and during the weekday for specials.
