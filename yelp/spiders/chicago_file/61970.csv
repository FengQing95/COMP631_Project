Smoque BBQ////Went here based on reviews.  Overrated but good.  Ill start with the worst thing.   The baked beans taste like you swallowed a campfire.  They were unedible.  They have a soda fountain way in the corner that we didn't see.  When I asked what they had to drink they pointed to this case filled with 12oz. sodas that were over almost $4 after tax.  We went there at 6pm so not late to avoid dried out bbq.  So I ordered the brisket.  Dry as a bone.  Glad I had the sauce to dip it in.  The mac and cheese was awesome but about as much as an ice cream scoop and they charge $2.95 a la carte for it.  The service was great except the counter worker forgot a side on both of our orders.  I wonder how many people realize they are missing a side with how busy it is.  Ill go again but I'll try the ribs since they looked great.
