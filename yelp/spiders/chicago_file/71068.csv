Little Goat Diner////Boyfriend and I went for late lunch on a Monday around 1:30pm, no wait. Our waiter was really nice and gave us some good recommendations. I had the sloppy goat and bf had the los drowned. We were both blown away by how amazing these sandwiches were!  Simply put, best sandwiches we've ever had- especially the sloppy goat.  I would definitely go back and try several other menu items!
