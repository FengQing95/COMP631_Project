Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////On to the update. Specifically, what 'they did' to make it right is actually what their Marketing Director Brittney did to make it right. Â She called me at home a few days after I posted this review and apologized profusely, admitted that the offensive songs were in fact played and it should never have happened. She provided me with a direct contact number and said that if we were in ever in Chicago again to call her, that "You have a friend here." Brittney then proceeded to find out the value of that mysterious gift card ($50), which we were never told that evening, then she asked what me and my wife's favorite restaurant in Austin was. I told her. It's not cheap. A few days later we got a gift card from that restaurant in the amount of $100. A sincere, notable gesture, for sure.
