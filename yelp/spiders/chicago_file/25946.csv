Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Mine was good but the Lou malnati was hands down one of the best pizzas I've ever tried. It was oozing in cheesy deliciousness and baked with some sausages and meats. It was so good and even the tomato sauce was flavorful. We didn't end up eating it all and took some to go. But if you're gonna try deep dish, come here.
