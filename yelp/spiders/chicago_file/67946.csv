Little Goat Diner////This place by far has the most kind, funny, and genuine staff. The food was amazing!! I have been here twice and the potions are pretty big. The wait is the only thing that stinks, but is totally worth the wait. The drinks are fantastic too!! Bloody Mary's are delicious and the prices are totally reasonably! Compliments to the chef/owner/staff/management. Wish I could give the waitress some credit by name. We will see you again.
