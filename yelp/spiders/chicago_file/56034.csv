Smoque BBQ////We arrived about 5pm on a Sunday and did get into a parking spot in the lot just west of the building they are in.  We had to stand outside about 5 minutes before getting inside and then I guess it was about 20 minutes (maybe a bit longer) before placing the order.  But the time is welcomed as you are trying to figure out what you want.
