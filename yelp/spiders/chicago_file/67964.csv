Little Goat Diner////Pretty overpriced little diner with nothing too special about it. I've had the fat club a few times which is really good if you like a lot of mayo. The Spanish omelette was amazing as well and the biggest portion I've ever had. Make sure you don't get seated at the counter- it's a little awkward set up and hard to talk to the person you're with. Overall okay spot, nothing to go out of your way for.
