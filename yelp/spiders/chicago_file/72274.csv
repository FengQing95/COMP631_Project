Little Goat Diner////I went on Monday night after unsuccessfully trying to get into Au Cheval down the street. There was a short wait but not bad, less time than they quoted us. My boyfriend ended up with the Korean burger: kimchi, bacon, egg, the works. It was good, not Au Cheval good but this isn't a "burger place"... necessarily. I had the fun and crispy chicken sandwich... also good but not great. I wish there was an option to do half orders. Since everything is a-la cart and comes with no sides, I would have loved to have ordered half a sandwhich so that we could have splurged on sides.
