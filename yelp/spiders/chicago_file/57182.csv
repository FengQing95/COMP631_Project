Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Their prices are very reasonable, especially when you share across a table of friends.  Their flan is, my goodness, five stars.  It was so rich and creamy (kind of like a creme brulee without the crusty caramel layer).  I ordered an espresso, to complete an already lovely dinner and linger over the conversation some more.  I definitely recommend this place and I'd come back for sure.  When it's warm there is outdoor seating and a portion of their indoor space has skylight windows on the ceiling, with tons of sunlight pouring in.
