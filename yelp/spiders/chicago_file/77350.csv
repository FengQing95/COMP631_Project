Little Goat Diner////The service is so friendly and attentive I can't say enough about the front of the house - they are working their butts off and it shows they care about how we feel.  The food is top notch - playful diner food is probably the best way to capture it, with an Asian brush stroke on some dishes for which Chef Izard has come to be known.  The portions are plentiful and there is no chance you will leave hungry.  Cinnamon buns are top notch and the Elvis waffle was really tasty and rich.  This restaurant has warmed my heart and filled my belly after long nights at the hospital -- with the post meal nap inevitable and welcomed!!!
