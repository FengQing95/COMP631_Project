Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I wait for the day when I can visit again to have their specialty berry pancake along with whatever savory breakfast dish they have.  Their pancakes are so light and they season it with the right amount of berry/lemon syrup to give it that tang where my mouth starts to water.  Plus, I love their biscuits and gravy.
