Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////To start we ordered a shrimp and an oyster platter: fresh, very decently sized and great taste! We followed with a salad and bone marrow: unbelievable, awesome taste. And our steaks (I ordered a ribeye) were just cooker perfectly medium rare! For sides we had the "Elote"... wow, I can't believe how incredibly delicious this was, we even ordered a second round of it!
