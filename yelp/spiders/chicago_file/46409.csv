Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The tapas with the asterisks were the most exceptional. The escargot was my absolute favorite. I would like to give this place 5 stars, but I can't since their drink selection is seriously lacking. They had about 5-6 cocktails on their menu which is pretty pathetic. Although the drinks are quite strong.....
