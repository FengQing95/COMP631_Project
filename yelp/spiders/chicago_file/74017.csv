Little Goat Diner////It has a fun casual atmosphere which contrasts with a lot of the trendy places up and down Randolph. The downside is that it's incredibly LOUD there. We had to practically shout at each other the entire meal. By the end we had hoarse voices. It is a reason we may not return soon. Â Wish they could solve that issue.
