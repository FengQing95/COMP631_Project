Little Goat Diner////Who wouldn't give this place a five star just to be there...just the thought of a swanky diner around the corner makes the day brighter. Sometimes servers get busy...but they always tell you about it. My recent fav is the tostadas...and of course the machos nachos. Food is way too much for two. But i dnt mind packing some of those for my sunday breakfast :)
