Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Great breakfast! The banana creme pancakes are slightly rich, but to die for! The create your own omelette is great if you want something savory and you can order small specialty pancakes as a side for something sweet. Service was wonderful and may even return for a second time on the same trip!
