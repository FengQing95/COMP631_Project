Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////When the bill came, we were charged for everything. Our waitress never once inquired why we left 3/4 of our steak untouched. Or at least she should have comped a drink or dessert for failing to acknowledge our anniversary and then having me have to tell her later. The table next to us which was seated at the same time waited an extra 5 minutes for their food than we did and they got the entire entree course comped. Maybe they ran out of comps after that. I don't know.
