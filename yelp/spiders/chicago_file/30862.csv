Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came here and ordered a small deep pan pizza for $16 plus other stuff. Let me tell ya, when the bill came we thought they made a mistake and charged $38 instead of $16 for that small pizza.  Turns out we chose our own toppings and were charged an extra $2.50 for each topping. Feeling bummed that this is NOT Blaze pizza, because they Don't  charge extra for toppings!!! It was an ok pizza but definitely not worth the price we paid.  Really disappointed  the server did not point it out to us. :(
