Little Goat Diner////I had the "Everything is Everything Crumpets," with lox, fried egg salad, tzatziki cream cheese, and pickles. The crumpets were like a cross between little biscuits and pancakes. The pickled onions were clearly made in house, so delicious. It's a big serving, so I couldn't even finish it all, but I tried!
