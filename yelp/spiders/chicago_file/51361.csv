Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Delicious tapas at a great price with consistently some of the best service I've experienced in any restaurant. As with any popular Chicago spot, reservations are highly recommended, as walk-in wait time can be long, but once sat, service is incredibly fast. Highly recommended: #44 (shrimp with garlic), #67 (bacon wrapped dates), seafood paella, and any flavor of sangria.
