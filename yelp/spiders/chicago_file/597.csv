Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I have been to Wildberry in the past and it was amazing and the service was great so I wanted to come back when in town again. However, My second experience was not as pleasant and I was disappointed. The food was great but the service was lacking. I understand it is busy in there but I felt overly rushed and every time someone walked by the would take something from the table. We could not really eat in peace. Before we were all finished eating the waitress suggested boxes and brought them over. When ready to leave there was 3 people standing at the end of the table, could barely get past them, waiting to clean and put new plates and grab the check. Just because the place is busy does not mean you can forget hospitality and force people out 15 minutes after they get their food. I was disappointed, even more so because the first experience was so great. But, I doubt I will return to Wildberry when I am back in town again.
