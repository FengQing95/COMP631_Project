Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I made a reservation there about a month ago for a celebration dinner.  We arrived for a 6:15 reservation and were seated around 6:30.  We were seated in the bar area (despite having a reservation) and it took our waiter about 30 minutes to take our drink order and then we had as the hostess who was walking by to track him down to take our dinner our which he did at around 7:30.   One of my guested ordered a soda during dinner which the waiter brought 30 minutes later after the dinner was done.  The restaurant was crowded but not overwhelming so.
