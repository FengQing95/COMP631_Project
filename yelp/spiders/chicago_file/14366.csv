Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered a thin crust pizza and an order of lasagna for take out and they told us it would be 40 minutes, which seemed a bit excessive seeing as we didn't order deep dish.  We left and came back almost 50 minutes later, and we told them our name.  The man at the host stand walked to the back and didn't return.  After almost 10 minutes, a manager then came up and asked us our name, went back and got our pizza.  We told them that we also had an order of lasagna and he said okay and walked to the back.  After about 10 minutes, my friend walked to the back and told them to forget about the lasagna and that we wanted our money back since we had been waiting for our food for well over an hour when we were told it would be 40 minutes.  All the sudden, our lasagna was ready.  We had essentially waited for them to make the lasagna because they had clearly forgotten all about it.  They told us that they would refund our money because of the wait, but that has yet to happen.
