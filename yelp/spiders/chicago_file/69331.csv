Little Goat Diner////I've been wanting to come here ever since it opened since I loved Girl and the Goat and I finally got the chance a few weeks ago. Originally wanted to try to get a reservation for brunch on opentable but could never find a spot. So my friends and I just decided to arrive at 10:30am on a Sunday and hope for the best. We ended up waiting about 30 minutes which wasn't too bad.
