Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Went to Bavette's with my wife and my Dad while in Chicago. The food is wonderful. I love steak, but can't digest it as well like I used to so I had the lamb chops. Man, meaty & delicious. My wife and my dad had the salmon and it was great. Our waiter, Kipp, was amazing and gave us excellent service. Well done!!
