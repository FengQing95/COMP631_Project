Art Institute of Chicago////A world class museum in its own right. I have traveled the world and can proudly say Chicago is lucky to have the Art Institute. Important works of art, beautiful architecture, affordable admission, some free evenings. I live for the modern wing. The courtyards are also a beautiful and relaxed setting for enjoying an afternoon or lunch.
