Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Word to the wise: If you're with a huge group, make sure to collaborate on your orders.  I swear the food just keep coming at us.  Literally, the entire group would say "Oh my god, I'm so full" and then...more food.  "Oh my god, I'm so full" and then...more food.  I made the mistake of ordering the paella, which I don't think was worth $20 (I'd much rather order 2 tapas), and it came at the end of the meal after people had said "Oh my god, I'm so full" x2.
