Art Institute of Chicago////Having visited Chicago on numerous occasions for conferences, I finally decided to visit the AIoC, and wow, I cannot believe that I waited so long to take the time out from the conference life to visit this amazing world class collection of art. On my first visit, I took care of the tickets online, which I highly recommend as it saves you significant time as you can bypass the ticket line at the museum. Also, the free pamphlet provided by AIoC is super useful, it provides a list of must see artwork, which I used as a treasure hunt of sorts that took me throughout the various sections. If you get lost (which is easy to do in this complex of adjacent buildings), ask for help (I did so on several occasions and each person was friendly in giving me directions. Spent 3-4 hours here, and would love to go back. Must see.
