The Purple Pig////I'm so glad I finally made it out to the Purple Pig!! We (3 of us) came in on a Saturday night around 10pm and we were seated right away; it was busy but not as busy as I thought it would be.  It was snowing so not sure if that was a factor.  We chose to sit at the bar vs one of the communal tables.
