Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My fiance and I came here last night for our eight-year anniversary at the recommendation of a friend who had been here before. The decor is lovely, with dim lights and candles creating an intimate atmosphere. The service was absolutely impeccable -- shout-out to Benjamin, our server who, by the way, has an amazing mustache! The timing of all of our dishes was prompt but not rushed, and all the details were so on point, down to the warm towel that we received after our oyster course.
