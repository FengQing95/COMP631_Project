Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////They started us out with piping hot sourdough bread - one large piece for each of us. I also got the Pago Pago, a rum-based cocktail with green chartreuse (a sweet, spicy and pungent liquor that apparently has a completely natural green colour) and pineapple. It was fantastic.
