Little Goat Diner////Awesome! The food here is very unique and locally sourced. The ambience is fantastic, too. It's a bit pricey, but it is worth it when you consider the ingredient quality. I highly recommend checking this place out if you're in the area. Shout out to Rebecca for providing us awesome service.
