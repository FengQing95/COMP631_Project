Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My first experience with deep dish pizza was...cheesy, a little too cheesy, perhaps. Having never had it before, it's hard for me to judge the quality at Lou Malnati's. The ingredients were fresh and served piping hot, so I'm guessing it's just a matter of personal preference. That said, I would have preferred more topping choices, less cheese, a chewier crust...oh wait, now I'm just describing Pizzeria Regina in Boston. Anyways, a trip to this classic Chicago establishment is totally worth it regardless of your pizza preference. Just be prepared to wait, both in line and at your table for these monster pies to cook.
