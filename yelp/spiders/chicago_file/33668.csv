Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For dessert I ordered the raspberry glazed cheesecake.  Horrible.  Absolutely the worst cheesecake I've had in my entire life, completely bland with a grainy texture.  They allowed me to take the lemon meringue pie in stead, which was decent but didn't really jump out at me since it didn't have a very strong lemony tartness that I love.  I'm sure for others it would be perfect, the meringue was lovely, but I don't remember the crust which means it probably wasn't the best pastry I've ever had.  In any case, the service was excellent and they removed both desserts from the bill.  I'd say they pretty much bent over backwards to make sure we left happy, and that to me makes up for a slightly less than perfect dining experience.  All in all I'd be very happy to return if ever I'm in Chicago again.  Thanks for a perfect steak and superlative service Bavette's!
