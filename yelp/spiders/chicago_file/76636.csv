Little Goat Diner////The little goat has a very large and extensive menu and all the options couldn't be more different. I tried the okanomyaki and hated it (unfortunately) ... the pancake itself was good but didn't like the sauces or taste. My mom had the little pig went to China and that was amazing, and the cinnamon roll was amazing, so I just think that it really depends on what you like and what you order. They still get a 4 for great service and an inventive menu
