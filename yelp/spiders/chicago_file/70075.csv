Little Goat Diner////Little Goat takes American diner familiars and gives them a twist, sometimes a big one, that pushes your horizons a little bit. Celebrity chefs like Stephanie Izard are smart to use their influence to teach in this way. Some goat milk in your latte? Kim chi in your hash? Brandade gravy with your biscuits? Loved the ideas flying around here and that goat milk latte was delicious btw.
