Smoque BBQ////Awesome bbq. Love the ribs. So tender and man are they smoky. I mean really really smoky. The bbq sauce is thick and sweet, just how I like it. Also enjoy the brisket and pulled pork. Also melt in your mouth. My favorite sides are cole slaw and mac and cheese. Some of the best ribs in Chicago. It's as smoky as it can get.
