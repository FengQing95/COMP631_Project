Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette, your food is delicious. I'm not a 'steak place' type of lady, but you've made the theme approachable. The menu is thought out and thorough. Your meat is top notch and your sides are scrumptious (the corn! the corn!). Your cocktails are quality and your bartenders are ridiculously talented.
