Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////For tapas, we got the chorizo wrapped date which was such a good combination of sweet and savory and had to add some more to our order! The brussel sprout salad also had a great flavor and was decently sized for a tapa. The goat cheese in tomato sauce with garlic bread was a great flavor as well and the bread was nice and crunchy. The grilled iberico pork was a little bit burnt in places but had a nice flavor and wasnt too hard to chew.
