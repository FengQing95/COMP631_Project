Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Most of the food we had was okay but that was about it, just okay. The bacon covered dates were a bit embarrassing in stature and the bacon was a bit too crisp for my liking. As for the remainder of the dinner that night I simply don't remember it and that statement alone might just speak for itself and what Ba-Ba-Reeba is - an unmemorable experience.
