Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////First time I have been disappointed in the food. Â My corned beef hash Benedict was room temperature. Only part that was hot were the poached eggs. English muffins were tough and had to saw through them with my knife. Hubby's scrambled eggs were cold. Son's avocado pieces in his omelette were a very unappetizing brown. He plucked them out and set them to the side. Pancakes were good. Service was great. We use the nowait app so never have to wait too long. Hoping it was a fluke.
