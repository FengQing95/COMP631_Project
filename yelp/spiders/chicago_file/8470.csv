Art Institute of Chicago////Going to the Art Institute reminds me of all the beauty in the world, and the never-ending drive of artists to achieve that beauty, to represent beauty, or even just to represent the world through their eyes.  Being able to see such amazing, priceless works of art in my own city is one of the reasons I love living in Chicago: it's here for my ogling pleasure.  Seeing the brush strokes of these famous works of art is breath-taking.  Even the giant, airy rooms with their imposing security guards, warning you not to get too close seem to whisk you away from your current reality.
