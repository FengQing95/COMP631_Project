Smoque BBQ//// The meat was very tender. The BBQ sauce was only adequate and too runny. I would have actually given it 3 stars based on the meat alone but I needed to even out this place because to me it definitely did not deserve all the 5 stars it has gotten. I've had MUCH better BBQ that was SO flavorful, and paid a better price for it. I didn't like any of the sides; mac n cheese or coleslaw. Both were bland. The fries were alright but I wouldn't even choose them over fast food fries. If you want great BBQ, there are better choices in the city.
