Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I was really looking forward to my dinner at Cafe ba ba Reba because there were so many other great reviews but I was honestly pretty disappointed. Nothing was terrible but it wasn't great either. The only dish I really loved of the night was the baked tomato and goat cheese and let's be honest it's pretty hard to screw up melted cheese. I had a very good glass of red wine as well. The other three dishes I got we're the spicy potatoes, the morrocan lamb meatballs and the grilled octopus. The spicy potatoes we're fine. The dipping sauce was very good but the potatoes themselves didn't really have a flavor it was all heat. The grilled octopus was fine. I've had better octopus and it was served at a weird temperature. It was also served on top of a chickpea puree that I don't think added anything to the dish. Â Lastly the meatballs had a great flavor but were way too chewy. Overall I didnt hate anything but I certainly was not wowed. I've had much better tapas other places in the city.
