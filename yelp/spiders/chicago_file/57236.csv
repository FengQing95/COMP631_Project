Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Absolutely amazing. Came here around noon on a Saturday and was seating immediately. We ordered a Benedict, burrata and the smoked salmon tapas and we're blown away by each one. The smoked salmon was one of the best things I've ever tasted. Atmosphere was welcoming and warm and overall a great experience.
