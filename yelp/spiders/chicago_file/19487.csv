Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have to admit I've grown up eating Lou Malnati's and the name alone, makes me a little nostalgic.  With that being said, I have tried Giordano's, Pequods and seemingly every "Chicago Style" pizza place out there and nothing holds a candle to Lou's.  The crust is buttery and thick (if you go deep dish but thin is just as good) and the toppings are generous.  My favorite thing about the deep dish is that they don't throw a can of tomato sauce on top, it's actually chunks of fresh stewed tomatoes and they are so much better than sauce.  On top of the pizza their signature salad is divine.  I even buy the Sweet Vinaigrette and use it on salads at home- it's just that good!  I'll be a life long customer, nothing is better than Lou's if you're looking for quality Chicago Style pizza!
