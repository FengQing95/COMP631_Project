Art Institute of Chicago////I consider myself to be really fast when checking out any kind of museum because I just sorta read the panel and then observe for a brief amount of time instead of hanging forever on one item or exhibit. Even so, I spent over two hours in here which shows how massive the collection is. My friend who is member said he's a huge art fanatic and easily spends five hours here per visit.
