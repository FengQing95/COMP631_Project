Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Atmosphere is great, it doesn't hurt either that it's in the Lincoln Park area, always very cool!  Huge place, there's also outdoor seating during the summer.  But because this place is huge, they went and tried to put as many tables as they could, it's very tight between tables.  Food is delicious, but somewhat expensive for such tiny portions.  Parking sucks, so I suggest not wasting anymore than one go around the block before you valet.
