Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou's is quintessential Chicago and I'll admit, I buy all my relatives their pizzas for Christmas out of novelty (no one else lives here) but the service is never good and the pizza is consistent but just not my favorite. It's more bland than some of the other Deep Dish places are pubs town.
