Smoque BBQ////On Valentine's day at 3, this place is packed.    I like the concept of forcing people to place their order before they choose their seat as it cuts down on potential issues.    I thought the ribs were ok, I found the sauce to be a little too peppery and not my thing.    The brisket on the other hand was moist, tasty, unbelievable good.    Brisket is a hard thing to master but they have.    The sides were good.   The peach cobbler was terrific but as far as bbq joints go, this is not a destination place for me.    I hate to say it but Kenny makes a better rib
