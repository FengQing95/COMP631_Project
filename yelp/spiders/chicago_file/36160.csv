Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is by far the most romantic setting with perfect drinks, food, deserts, and service (Natalia and Leonard). It is true dining, we were there about three hours in the lower level enjoying everything from the table, comfy chairs, conversation with the staff, cocktails, music playlist, oysters, homemade bread, shrimp dijon, the stroganoff, pork chop, decor, and a lemon meringue pie slice to share.  They truly made our 20th anniversary a memorable one.  Also, they have a corkage policy where they will cork your bottle of wine free of charge if you share a glass with another guest, a server brought us over a glass from a couple across the room, loved that! Definitely will bring a bottle to enjoy with dinner next time, but won't let that allow us to skip the perfectly crafted cocktails.
