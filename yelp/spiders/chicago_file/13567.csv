Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza itself it pretty good, but after trying several Pizza places in the City it's difficult for this place to warrant the four or five stars. They deep dish pizza is tasty but there was nothing about in particular that gave a sudden "woah" after my first bite. Sure I would go here again and again, but this place seems to be way over hyped for the Chicago area. The location in the River North area is pretty awesome, I enjoyed the service and the wait time was pretty quick as well.
