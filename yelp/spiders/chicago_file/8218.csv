Art Institute of Chicago////This museum is HUGE. I went here when they had a special exhibition on Seurat and I spent the entire day looking at each of the art and the description at the bottom. I went from Seurat to Asian civilization art to impressionist to sculptures and I could keep going if I hadn't had to go to catch the train.
