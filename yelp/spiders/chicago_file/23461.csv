Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So glad I decided on Lou Malnati's over Giordano's. I came here with my family and we ordered "The Lou" which included spinach, mushroom, garlic, 3 cheeses and tomato. Basically everything I love on pizza! It was SO good, and definitely surpassed our standards. The wait time to be seated was 45 minutes to an hour on a Wednesday night, and after getting seated they put your pizza in the oven so that's another 30-45 minutes. One thing I wish our waiter would have told us is how long the pizza would take in the oven. We were all waiting with no idea how long we'd be there. But in the end, it was all worth it. The pizza was hot, cheesy and the crust was buttery and not too thick. We ordered a large which came with 8 slices for 6 of us. A slice comfortably filled me up but I could have easily eaten another half slice. I would recommend ordering enough so everyone gets 1.5-2 slices! I stumbled upon a lot of tourist traps in terms of Chicago restaurants, but this place lived up to the hype.
