Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Once we sat down we ordered another round of drinks and a salad. The reason I knocked a star off is because the second drink (Moscow Mule) I received was not very good. I continued to drink it as I really dislike complaining at a restaurant unless absolutely necessary. I think instead of vodka, gin was used.
