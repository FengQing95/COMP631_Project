Little Goat Diner////I came here for dinner last week and shared the strawberry short shake, smoked fries, cheesy garlic french bread, Korean burger, and pecan pie. The Korean burger was quite tasty but extremely hard to eat because the bun was soggy. The cheesy garlic bread was good, but the marinara was bland. The shake, fries, and pecan pie were tasty. The service was so-so. We told our waitress we'd like to share the shake, and she came back with two straws and seemed irritated with us when we asked for a second glass.
