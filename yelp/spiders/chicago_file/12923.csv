Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Staff was great, parking not a problem (Monday afternoon).  Wait was bad.  Pizza was good, but I guess I was expecting a WOW.  I have heard that Chi Style is a matter of taste, as this is more of a cassarole with dough, but I wasn't a huge fan.  Still better than a lot of the stuff we get in CA.  But not close to what you get in NYC.  Price was so-so
