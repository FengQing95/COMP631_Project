Smoque BBQ////My favorite BBQ around. The brisket is amazing, chopped or sliced. Get extra sauce. Also, ask for some spicy sauce if you like some heat. All the sides are amazing... Literally all of them but especially the mac. I don't normally eat Cole slaw except here. No mayo, just some vinegar, SOOO GOOD!!!!
