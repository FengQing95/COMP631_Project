Smoque BBQ////The Coleslaw was great! Theirs is the vinegary variety and is loaded with flavor. Both the Mac & Cheese and Cornbread which were served in tiny oven tins were dry & just not worthy. I also didn't understand the sauce situation. My ribs came with 1 tiny container, my husband got 2 different ones. The containers were way too small to dip a rib into plus there wasn't enough sauce to even decide if I liked it. Squeeze bottles of sauce in the restaurant would be a much better option.
