The Purple Pig////I was initially apprehensive about visiting a restaurant with Pig its name because I personally do not eat red meat and my sister is trying to avoid eating red meat, but they had a wide variety of dishes that we were still able to order. It is tapas style and our server recommended we order 2-3 dishes per person. We ordered 4 in total but it was still too much food, I think 3 total would have been perfect. We ordered the burrata, the broccoli, chicken bolognese pappardelle, and the brown butter truffle mushroom cappellacci.
