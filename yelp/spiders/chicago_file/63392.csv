Smoque BBQ////So with my 50th bday looming right in the middle of the Covid 19 insanity all while I was Â recouping from what was very likely the covid 19 virus, I was a little bummed out. I knew that if I had the combo of hanging with my wife a kids along with enjoying Smoque's best bbq on the planet , I would have the absolute best bday under the circumstances. Given that I was lucky to have both I really did have the best bday under the circumstances. We kept it simple by getting four slabs of baby backs, a half pound of brisket and a extra quart of Memphis bbq sauce for the ribs and for my cereal the next morning and anything else I will be eating for the next couple of weeks. I remember trying Smoque when it first opened. I remember the brisket and both the Carolina and Memphis sauces all being the best I've ever had. I remember the ribs as being great but second best to another rib joint in Chicago. Smoque is one of those unusual restaurants that actually gets better with age. They never cut corners. The quality and consistently of EVERYTHING they serve, could not be more perfect. Now I can honestly say that their brisket, their ribs and sauces are by far my favorites in Chicago and on the planet! To the entire staff at Smoque, thank you for always being there for me especially during this crazy time and for my 50th bday when I needed y'all the most!
