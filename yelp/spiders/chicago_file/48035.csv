Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Food was OUTSTANDING! Lauren who was our waitress was AMAZING! Give her a raise!! Lol .. Bacon wrapped dates are sweet and savory, the tapas are a perfect size. The Butterscotch pudding is tantalizing. It's light creamy texture is unforgettable. That dessert is highly recommendable.
