Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////All of Brendan's restaurants are fantastic, but this is my favorite steakhouse in the city. Great food, ambience and an excellent old fashioned.  Favorite foods include the ribeye, bone-in filet, seafood towers, smoked whitefish ceasar (trust me, it's great), and the ellote style corn.  Wine list could be a little better, but they allow you to bring your own bottle, as long as you share one glass with another table.  Head to the speakeasy downstairs (the parlor, the lights are even dimmer than upstairs) if you're looking for a more romantic dinner or a drink after dinner.
