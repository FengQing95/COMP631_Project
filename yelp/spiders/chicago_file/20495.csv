Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our server (Alex?) was great - attentive but not too attentive, with a great personality.There was a 45-minute wait for a deep dish pizza, which we expected. Â However, after waiting 45 minutes, there was a mix-up, and our pizza was served to another table. The manager came right over, explained the situation and took care of everything superbly. The customer service was fantastic. The pizza was delicious. I loved the sauce - tangy not sweet. I liked the crust flavor and texture well enough, although it's not my favorite crust. Overall, we had a great experience. And, randomly, I loved the to-go boxes. They're really neat and well thought out.
