Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////one of my new FAVORITE restaurants! every single thing i consumed was absolutely amazing and unique! the sangria, stuffed mushrooms, the spicy potatos! oh my! i left here feeling satisfied, not overly full and like i simply just ate well. didn't feel bloated by high salt levels from mexican or like i got mediocre food.
