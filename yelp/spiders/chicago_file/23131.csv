Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////By far the best Chicago deep dish we had while staying! All the locals recommended it and I'm glad we did it! Staff is super friendly! Got a memorial picture at the front and took our pizza back to the hotel to enjoy. Make sure you get butter crust! Totally worth it all! Love the local giardiniera peppers too! I don't know how we'll ever return to Florida now. Well both be day dreaming until we return to the Windy City
