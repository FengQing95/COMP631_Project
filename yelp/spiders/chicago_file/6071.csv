The Purple Pig////We started off with the burrata canoli (apricots, olive caramel, heirloom tomatoes) which was pretty good. The burrata was lighter than I expected and it worked well with the canoli shell. We also had the milk-braised pork shoulder (mashed potatoes and crispy lentils), pork belly tenderolin (ginger glaze, carrot, espresso) and stuffed squid (black eyed peas, prosciutto bread crumbs, chermoula). The stuffed squid was our favorite out of the dishes that we tried. I thought the pork belly was just okay and preferred the braised pork shoulder. As crazy as it sounds...I loved the mashed potatoes that came with the pork shoulder.
