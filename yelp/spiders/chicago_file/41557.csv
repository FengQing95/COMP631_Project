Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One cool thing about the menu: the pintxos.  They're bite-sized mini-tapas for $1.50.  We had the artisenal spanish cheese and quince and the chorizo wrapped dates.  The dates rivaled some of the best meat-wrapped-dates we've had in Chicago, including such places at Avec.  The chorizo was sliced super-thin and everything was flavored exquisitely.  We had to stop ourselves from getting 10 of them.
