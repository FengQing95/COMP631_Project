Little Goat Diner////We ordered Los Drowned, All American Burger, and a fried chicken salad. Those are tasting good. The bread of burger and sandwich is awesome. I am also amazed with the juicy steak in my burger. My friend is satisfied with the Los Drowned. Our server is nice and patient, willing to accommodate our allergy concern. Everyone seems happy here. I like the atmosphere, the only concern is that you need to speak loud here, or you cannot hear what your friend talked.
