Little Goat Diner////Meh, maybe I should have came for the Sunday Brunch and no right before a night out? I wanted to grab a quick dinner with a few friends before our evening of debauchery. Chef Izard's Little Goat was a definite "meh" for us. We had the biscuits and gravy and the Korean scallion pancake thing. Both were underwhelming in flavor. The biscuits were dry and the gravy lacked salty. The Scallion pancake was messy and lacked a sauce or something. I like the home-like feel to the place. Service was just alright but prices seemed a little high for an alright meal.
