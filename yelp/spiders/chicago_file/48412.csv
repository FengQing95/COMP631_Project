Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Gotta say everything was cooked really well.  We even requested the shrimp that is served on this hanging skewer thing usually served for hosted private parties. My girlie who adores this place was familiar with this item as she frequents it a-many a times.  I am not a fan of crazy, over the top presentations. Meaning, I don't have fun at hibachi Benihana-esque places ain't my cuppa tea. This thing was just swinging in front of my face blocking the view of my friends in front of me. As front it's presentation, it was alright. Spices and flavors melded well. Nothing was bland or too powerful.
