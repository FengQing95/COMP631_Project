Art Institute of Chicago////Visiting the Art Institute of Chicago is like flipping through an art history textbook.  Everywhere you look, there are so many famous artworks, one after another.  The museum is chock full of major European (Picasso, Matisse, Kandinsky) and American (Hopper, Pollock, Cassatt ) artists, as well as collections of Asian, African, and Native American art.  The permanent collections of Impressionist and post-Impressionist works are particularly impressive.  There's also a heavy taste of Chicago that influences this museum, with plenty of interior pieces by Frank Lloyd Wright as well.
