Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have to admit, I'm typically a thin crust pizza kinda girl.  Lou Malnati's is bomb though!!  And, it's cheap!!  My gf and I split a small salad and a small deep dish pizza and we were stuffed.  We eat A LOT too!  Just remember that if you order a deep dish pizza, it takes about 35-40 minutes to bake!
