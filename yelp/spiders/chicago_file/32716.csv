Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Sometimes when a place is expensive/hard to get into you're extra critical. Happily it lived up to the hype. I wasn't in the mood to drop $60 on a steak so I ordered the meatball and split the brussels sprouts and broccoli with my husband (who did get steak.) Everything was fantastic--the broccoli charred the way you want it, crispy and just salty enough, the meatball super-savory and the brussels sprouts sweetly reminiscent of General Tso's chicken, again, blackened expertly. Even the sourdough bread was awesome. But the service really took it over the top. Our server Ben was super attentive and basically seemed excited for us that we were on a hot date. I appreciated that he was honest about how big the salads were and that it'd probably be too much food to get the stuffed avocado AND the meatballs. And I extra appreciated the celebratory bubbles he sent over. Worth the wait and the cost. I'm looking for an excuse to come back!
