Little Goat Diner////So darn good. I came here alone so I sat at the counter.  I think this is probably the best seat in the house for someone like me who eats with her eyes before ordering.  I ended up getting the crispy fish tostadas.  They're heavy but very very good.  I also started with a tomato and apple soup.  It's good but I don't really taste apple in it.
