Art Institute of Chicago////I never thought I'd say this, but the Met officially has some competition for my favorite American museum. I visited the Art Institute for the first time in November during a trip to Chicago for an interview and was blown away. The Beaux-Arts building itself is stunning and the collection is unbelievable. The Impressionist and Post Impressionist gallery is enormous and features more of Monet's Haystacks than I've seen in a single location, works by Renoir, Cezanne, Matisse, Van Gogh, Calliebotte, and Seurat's spectacular A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. I could easily spend an entire day here, but given my time constraints didn't have a chance to explore too far beyond the Impressionists. I'm looking forward to becoming a member when I move to Chicago this Fall and seeing the rest of the museum.
