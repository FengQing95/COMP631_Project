Smoque BBQ////Enjoyed our outside patio meal under the tent.  BBQ was excellent including baby back ribs & chopped brisket sandwich, along with cornbread, chili & cole slaw.  What really stood out was the commitment to a safe dining experience.  Ordering process, table seating, food delivery and continuous cleaning of tables/chairs demonstrated great consideration for the health of customers and employees.  Well done!
