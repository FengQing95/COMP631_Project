Smoque BBQ////Incredible BBQ. Had the chopped brisket with slaw, fresh cut fries, n Mac n cheese.  Also had a half slab of ribs which I was not a fan of.  But EVERYTHING was excellent. The bbq sauce is addicting.  My cousin had the sliced brisket and I think I would of gotten that instead. But it was still awesome. Highly recommend this BBQ joint. Want to try the corn bread and chicken next time.
