Little Goat Diner////One of my favorite stops. Any time I have a special event or special guest in town, I recommend this special spot! My personal favorite is the scallion pancake, but you definitely cannot miss their crab dip! Addicting appetizers and delightful dinners all around. Plus, it's cute!
