Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Friday night was the second time I've eaten at Bavettes. The first time was during their soft opening and everything was amazing. From the service and ambiance to the food. It was easily one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. The other night was atrocious. If any of my friends have eaten at Bavettes due to my recommendation I apologize.
