Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Great food. We are the sun dried tomato and avocado omelet, hash browns, and fresh berry pancakes. It was delicious and definitely worth the half hour wait. They don't do reservations though. They have coffee, smoothies, and other drinks you can order while waiting. Location is great as well:)
