Little Goat Diner////Writing this a year after our visit but I've been dreaming of these meals ever since! Dinner and then breakfast here the next morning. Dinner was one of my favorite salads ever---THE CHICKPEA: think of a falafel plus chicken here. kale . chopped veggies . montamore cheese . tzatziki . chee vinaigrette . And add the chicken. I love me some fancied up oatmeal and breakfast was out of this world--OATMEAL
