Smoque BBQ////2 Stars for logistics and set up of this restaurant: It's so difficult to get a table and you have to wait for a while just to be seated on top of your neighbor. There's one area for drinks that is in the far corner and you're bumping into people just to move. Plus the cups they give you are so small for water, you might as well plan on getting up multiple times just to get enough water. We did move through the line pretty quick considering how packed but still, not a pleasant experience.
