Smoque BBQ////Main meal: Baby Back ribs were flavorful and smoky BUT dry and a bit tough =/ They sold out of St. Louis ribs about 40 minutes into my long wait in line. Perhaps the higher fat content of the St. Louis ribs would be more tender and moist. Sad day for us.  Chopped brisket was the same - flavorful but dry.  Their BBQ sauces were also disappointing.
