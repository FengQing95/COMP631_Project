Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Great, standard brunch. Nothing revolutionary but it was all extremely tasty and served in large portions. Service was great, the line was understandably long for a great brunch place right next to all the tourist attractions (about an hour) but we just walked around to kill the time. We had a skillet and pancakes, both were delicious and heavy. It's not a gourmet brunch place, but would definitely go here again as it offers the standard brunch foods at a very high quality.
