Little Goat Diner////Now, here's for the best part of the meal-the dessert. Holy moly. We ordered the peppermint mattie, which was spiced chocolate gelato, peppermint gelato, chocolate peppermint sauce and whipped cream. Absolutely out of this world. The peppermint sauce on the top actually tasted like real mint and not the artificial stuff. I will be back for more, and believe me, I will eat through this whole menu.
