Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I love Lou Malnati's pizza!! Deep dish and thin crust, you can't go wrong! This place is always busy so plan accordingly and call ahead! The pizza sizes are smaller than normal and more expensive but it is so good! The Lou Malnati's sweet vinaigrette dressing is to DIE FOR!!!!
