Little Goat Diner////I wish I could give this four and a half stars (because I reserve 5 stars for the super fancy nice restaurants).  It's comfy, inviting, bright AND has amazing food. Every single thing I ate was delicious. Fish tostadas with the pea shoots side (leafy greens in a light tangy sauce) and the choco taco sundae for dessert.  UGH. So freaking good.
