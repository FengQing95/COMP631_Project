Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've honestly had better frozen pizza. I was in Chicago on a trip a few weeks ago and ordered a personal size deep dish pizza to go. I had high expectations, having heard great things about Chicago pizza. I ordered over the phone and walked over to the restaurant to pick it up. It took about 30 minutes for my pizza to arrive - this was not a good start. When I ate the pizza a few minutes later in my hotel, I was very disappointed. This was a sausage pie and the sausage overshadowed every other aspect of the pizza. There was basically a giant piece of chewy, salty, tasteless meat taking up the entire radius of the pie, covered with a thick layer of gummy cheese. Under this was a skimpy lawyer of tomato sauce. Not only were the proportions way off, but none of the components tasted particularly good individually. The sum of these parts was even worse. In an effort to sate myself for the coming flight home, I ended up pulling the meat patty off of the pizza and trying just the crust. This was similarly unappetizing. I ended up tossing most of the pizza and getting a sandwich at the airport.
