The Purple Pig////At some point, he cleared our table, kinda in a hurry.. I felt really uncomfortable and rushed. Then he went to the back and I was relieved that I was getting a break from him breathing down my table. BUT THEN... this woman with an iPad appeared outta nowhere and started doing the saaaame thing. Really obnoxious.
