Smoque BBQ////The flavor of the sauces were incredible - especially the spicy sauce. The macaroni and cheese was perfect as well. I wish there would have been larger portions - the side was almost $5 and it was probably 10 bites. My only complaint is that the food wasn't very hot - I ordered a chopped brisket sandwich and the meat was cold, great flavor I just wish it would have been hot! Same with the fries - great flavor but they were cold!
