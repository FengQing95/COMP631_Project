Little Goat Diner////The chili sauce was delicious and really made the sausage even better. the eggs were a delicious mess and the biscuit was crispy/fluffy/perfect. the blackberries i thought was genius! added a great sweet and tart element to the dish. The only downside i thought was that the dish overall was a little bit too salty. (not inedible, but definitely makes you drink water or wish you had some other dish to eat it with)
