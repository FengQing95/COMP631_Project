Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The wait was long. The food was not to my liking. I had a basic eggs Benedict. I did not like the hollandaise sauce or the super thick piece of ham on it. Â I also ordered the berry bliss waffle, reason for the two stars. That was delicious. I would come back for that. The berry sauce on it was to die for!
