Smoque BBQ////My friends and I drove about 40 min. to try this place (which was featured on diners, drive-ins and dives) for lunch. Since we didn't eat breakfast, we were all getting a little irritable from hunger. But after trying the first bite of our food, we suddenly became very happy -- if you were eavesdropping on our table, you basically would have heard a bunch of "oh my god"s and "this. is. AMAZING."
