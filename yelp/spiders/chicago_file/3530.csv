The Purple Pig////You gotta love pig...I really enjoyed everything about The Purple Pig. The food was fantastic, service was friendly and attentive, I ordered the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes it was phenomenal fork tender pork and the mashed potatoes were so silky amazing, Charred Cauliflower side dish. All the dishes were tasty and each dish had a great combination of flavors. The dessert was just amazing...And I thought the price was very reasonable for the quality of the food and location. If you are a Girl&The Goat fan, you will love The Purple Pig they have very similar concept. Both Amazing! 100% recommend!
