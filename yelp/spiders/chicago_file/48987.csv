Smoque BBQ////The restaurant reminds me of my grandparents youth when an enterprising person usually an immigrant would make a restaurant in their front room. The restaurant is on one level with the cooking ovens and facilities at the back and the seating at the front. The place d√©cor is rough and ready yet spotless. They served the meal on trays with plastic knives and forks and sides in polystyrene containers but it did not matter for the food was fabulous, well cooked and flavorsome. This is a place you dream about eating at and so do many others the place was packed.
