Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Aside from having to completely unlearn how to order off a menu, the transition into eating tapas was explained quickly by our server. If I were to make two recommendations that you will actually remember (in English) by the time you get there - get anything with goat cheese, and any of the potato dishes. This is only the second tapas restaurant I have been to, and the quality of food here far outweighs the first. My only complaint is the wait time on most of the dishes.
