Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The wait staff was slow, the drinks were fine and were the only saving grace, and our waiter forgot one of the orders, of course for a client, since that was predictable, and even though the drinks were fine, they still took forever to make. My dad ordered none of the fancy cocktails (gin and tonic) and you would have thought they had to go out to purchase the gin. All in all, we won't be returning. Poor service for the price and nothing that stands out to make me say, well, except for the service, we would return...
