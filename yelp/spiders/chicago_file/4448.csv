The Purple Pig////Okay so now the important info on the food- we started with Kerry Gold cheese and pino noir jelly. It was very good but "least" favorite of all the dishes. The second dish was the grilled broccoli in an amazing sauce and this broccoli was unlike any I had ever tasted. The best broccoli I have EVER had!! The broccoli and scallion garganelli tie for my favorite. The homemade pasta and sweet flavorful sauce were something my taste buds will never forget! Finally we shared the pork blade steak with arugula salad. It was the perfect finish to our evening but we couldn't finish it all after our three other dishes (we had LOTS of broccoli). Next visit to Chicago we will be back to try more of their food! Hopefully they can too our amazing experience!
