Little Goat Diner////Stopped here to kill time before a flight. I'll be honest I had the corned beef hash and with scrambled eggs and it exceeded my expectations. I wasn't a fan of the prices or oddly overpriced coffee but when in Chicago expect to pay a little more I suppose. I would love to explore the other options such as the pancakes and French toast since it was difficult to choose. Would certainly come back, the service was superb.
