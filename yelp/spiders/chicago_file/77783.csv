Little Goat Diner////I've been here a couple of times and I'm never disappointed. The food is amazing and the atmosphere is great. I think it's lovely how they have incredibly a sweet and rich breakfasts available and on the other side savory foods that I wouldn't have been willing to try somewhere else.
