Art Institute of Chicago////The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the last time I went, they had so many collections under construction and big-attraction pieces out on loan that of my pre-visit list, there were more things I couldn't see than I could. When the back of the museum program lists the 9 most well known pieces to see if you only have an hour, you really do a disservice if 3 of them are unavailable for viewing and you don't make that information known to customers. Â Why put people through a string of disappointments as they go from exhibit to exhibit not able to view the piece they're looking for? There should be a list of everything that's not there before you buy your tickets so you are informed what you are paying for.
