Smoque BBQ////No trip ta da Windy City is complete widout a visit to Smoque.  I feel like this dis is da best BBbq joint in the da city.  Dere was 4 of us, me & the tree Lilliputians.  All of dem are 4'-11" short but dey all eat like giants.  We ordered a full rack of meaty St Louis Ribs, 1lb of delicious perfectly seasoned & cooked brisket, a couple orders of Mac & cheese, coleslaw, beans, gumbo & da sauces.  Dey come wit Carolina bbq sauce (a little sweet) & Memphis big sauce (a little spicy (no too much do).  Dis isn't my first rodeo here & hopefully it won't be my last.
