Art Institute of Chicago////My one complaint is that I feel it could have been laid out a little better; some of the exhibits were awkward in that when you got to the end, instead of it just looping into the hall like most of the exhibits at home do, you'd have to retrace your steps back the way you came, pushing your way through the Friday night crowd.
