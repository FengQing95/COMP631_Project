Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Love, love, love!!! Best tapas place in the city. The sangria is legit fire. Portions are pretty big so 3-4 plates is more than enough for 2 people. I love their weekend brunch menu to be specific. Make sure you order the bacon wrapped dates and spicy potatoes. Servers are awesome!
