Art Institute of Chicago////As a member, a visitor, and a volunteer at AIC I want to commend and compliment the security officers at the museum for their kindness and helpfulness to visitors. I see it each time I'm here...and cannot say enough about those who are so good to people, often who speak a foreign tongue. It is unique in museums.
