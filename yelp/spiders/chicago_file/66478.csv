Little Goat Diner//// The service was slow  as it took 25 minutes for food to be served for a table of one  and the place was not busy as it was Wednesday morning around 10:00 am.  Wait staff was friendly  but  it  seems the kitchen still has to work out  some execution issues with food and timing which impacts service. Hesitant to go back for another visit. Experience  was more style than substance.
