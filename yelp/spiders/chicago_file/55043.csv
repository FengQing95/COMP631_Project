Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ordered the sausage tapas that displays four different kinds--not a sausage fan (seen too many food docus) but the garlic sauce coupling absolutely killed it. I felt like Thor slamming this dish down. Enjoyed the goat cheese tomato blend & garlicy bread, but less so. I felt immoral eating the hangar steak with mushroom sauce.
