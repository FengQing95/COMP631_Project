Art Institute of Chicago////If I could give a 100 stars I would! This place is so amazing I am almost speechless... one of the best museums in the country. I spent 5 1/2 hours here and I still felt like I could have stayed longer. They have everything from Asian art, African art, Rodin, Warhol, Degas, Picasso... and everyone in between! Great pieces and the staff is very knowledgeable. Highly recommend!
