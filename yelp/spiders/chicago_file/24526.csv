Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have never had Chicago style pizza so I have nothing to compare my experience to but my pizza was incredible. We ordered the Lou which is a mushroom and spinach pizza. Dont go in a rush. Expect to wait 30 to 35 minutes for your pie and there can be a long line to get in. All is worth the wait. We ordered some appetizers and they were okay. I thought the sauce was a bit flat and the fried platter was basic. But the pizza was OMG good. I have never had nothing like it. Service was good and consistently checked on our table for water, tea and how are food was. I highly recommend this restuarant as a "visit Chicago bucket list item".
