Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Something I really appreciated about this place, other than food and ambiance, was the server. Christina was really knowledgeable. She had tasted many of the menu items personally and could comment intelligently about them. She also knew how to pay attention to us and how to leave us alone. A rare gift!!
