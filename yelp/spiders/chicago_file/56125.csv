Smoque BBQ////This BBQ is great!  I've lived in Texas for 7-8 years so I know about good bbq!  I had the babyback ribs, which were tender and delicious.  The brisket was very, very tender, easily breakable just using your fork.  The mac 'n cheese is delicious as well.  I think the side dishes are a bit small for the price, but the bbq can't be beat by anywhere else in Chicago.
