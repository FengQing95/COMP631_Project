Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Heard about this place before we got to Chicago.  Definitely worth the hype.  We got the three cheese bread, deep dish cheese pizza, and half "Lou" half "classic maltnati".  I preferred the classic maltnati but everything was really good.  First time having deep dish pizza and I'm glad I got to try it in Chicago where it famous.  We got carryout since we have kids and read about the wait being really long and the wait for deep dish to be 40-45 min.  So glad we did.
