Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The people have spoken!  Lou Malnati's is the best Chicago style pizza in Chicago.  Prior to our visit to Chicago I did quite a bit of research trying to decide which pizza joint to visit during our stay.  There are so many pizza restaurants to choose from and considering we didn't have a lot of time in Chicago, it wasn't an easy decision.  After asking several locals during our stay, and considering Lou's has been featured on the Food Network and the Travel channel multiple times, Lou's was my choice.  Three things stand out in which I feel makes Lou's a truly unique and superior pie.  The crust, the sausage, and the tangy tomato flavor sauce.  A truly remarkable pizza.
