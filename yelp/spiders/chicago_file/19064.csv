Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Being from the west coast, I was happy to learn that you can actually order Lou's online and they'll have it delivered! A few weeks later a few friends and I tried it, they deliver it frozen, put it in the oven for about 45 minutes and bam! got yourself deep-dish pizza from Chicago, still tasting pretty good.
