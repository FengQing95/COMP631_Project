Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////So incredibly delicious! The service was very professional and quick. Â They treat it like an experience, which it definitely was! We arrived at about 530pm, and waited about 30 minutes for a table. We had drinks at the bar, and watching the bartenders work was amazing! We had the shortrib stroganoff, prime rib sandwich, frites, and the Mexican corn. No complaints here! They also have a nice cocktail and bar selection. We enjoyed the Bavette's punch and champagne splash.
