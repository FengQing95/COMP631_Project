Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We got to the restaurant on a weekend afternoon around 5:30p and boy was that the right choice! There was no line, no wait, and our order came out within half and hour! (as rumors have it that the thick crust takes a while) Service was great and the food was even better. Our waiter offered to pour our wine for us, dished out our salad servings one by one, and offered to plate our slices of pizza to each of us. The food was hot and fresh. The deep dish was steaming hot inside and out. The crust was buttery and delicious. The thin crust was soft and chewy but still held a great flavor. I usually don't like pizza but I definitely feel like I have been left out. If only I had tried Chicago deep dish pizza earlier!! This will be a memorable place for me during my visit to the beautiful city of Chicago. Â love love love*
