Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I am new to Chicago and have been looking to lose my deep dish virginity. Lou's didn't disappoint. I am never going to be a fan of the sauce on top of the pizza, but the sauce is so fresh and almost pureed looking. I had the staple, The Lou, it was great. Loaded with an abundance of meat and cheese, but the crust is what elevated it. Buttery and crisp that blended with the ingredients of the pizza perfectly. Going to Lou Malnati's will require a wait, both for the busy crowd and also for the time to make the pizza. Nothing much can be done there to prevent that, it's just always a busy joint. The ambiance is fine, it is nicely lit and includes a ton of Chicago memorabilia inside. Lou's is all about the product though. I will always be a fan of thinner crust, but I definitely came to respect Lou's and its deep dish.
