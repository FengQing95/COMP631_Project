Art Institute of Chicago////I was really surprised by the brilliant statues and busts in the American (?) wing. Â There is a lady that works down there named Barbara Webster, who has a unique taken on art, and kindly told us about the aspects of some of her favorite pieces, namely a bronze statue of an American Indian teaching his son (or mentee, I believe) how to shoot a bow and arrow.
