Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food was great. PRICEY, but great. It would be hard for two people to leave without having spent at least $200. We ordered the goat cheese appetizer, and I would HIGHLY recommend it. I hadn't realized that it was going to come with 6 large slices of texas toast and that it would basically be a cheesy marinara dip. It was tasty and most importantly filling and general in size. We each opted for a steak since that's what they're known for, and I got the tiniest 6 oz, but it was the right amount since I'd had that appetizer. My boyfriend got the dry-rubbed NY strip, and it was tasty and also super generous in size. His concern with "fancy" restaurants is always that the serving sizes are so small, but that was not the case here. We each left with leftovers, which almost never happens. I got the elote-syle corn as a side, and it was delicious, and also large.
