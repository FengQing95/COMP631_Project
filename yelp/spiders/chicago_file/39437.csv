Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Everyone says this is a must try spot but I'm always going to Maple and Ash when I want a steak. I ended up trying this place and I can't get over how much better it is than Maple and Ash. I got the bone in filet and it was to die for. The mash potatoes were FANTASTIC and the duck and goat cheese layered appetizer was unlike anything I've ever had. But I will say the BEST thing at this entire restaurant is the bread! LOL. I'm dead serious the bread and butter was out of this world.
