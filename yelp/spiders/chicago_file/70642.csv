Little Goat Diner////Outside of them not seating you until your entire party is actually in the building, I love going to this place. The oatmeal is amazing and the coffee choices are great for a coffee drinker like me. Be ready to wait if you come when it's busy but worth the wait. The bartenders are also awesome to talk to and engage with as you eat lunch.
