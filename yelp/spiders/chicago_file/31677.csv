Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's is such a Chicago staple and you can't go wrong with them. Deep dish, thin crust, it all tastes great. Just keep in mind, deep dish pizzas generally take 40 minutes minimum to make after you place your order. So if you're eating in the restaurant, it could be 40-60 minutes after you order until you get to eat. We typically only order deep dish for delivery and it's best to order straight from the restaurant for the best/fastest service. The portions they recommend for the size of your party are spot on. Even on an empty stomach, most people are not going to be able to eat more than one or two slices of deep dish pizza. Generally, for two people, we order a medium deep dish pizza, eating two slices each, and still have a couple slices left over. We opt for the low-fat mozzarella cheese with sausage and pepperoni for toppings. They had a promo for free chicken wings this past weekend, so we ordered some honey bbq wings. They were OK, but probably wouldn't order them in the future. Considering they were free, still a 10/10 experience. Of course there are endless options when it comes to deep dish pizza, but I definitely recommend Lou Malnati's or Giordano's to people visiting the city! Pequod's and Art of Pizza are a close second.
