Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Get the deep dish with the sausage! While here in Chicago I tried another deep dish but this one won hands down!  The thin crust isn't to bad and was enjoyable.  Would suggest to friends.  The pizza does take 30mins to make so if you are hungry order a snack.  We went with the mozzarella sticks.  Very good!
