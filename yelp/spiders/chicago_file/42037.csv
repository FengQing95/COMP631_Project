Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've traveled and lived all over the world, and during that time Chicago's become the home of some of the best and trendiest restaurants.  While the new restaurants are good and I do go to them, I've never gone back twice.  Ba ba reeba on the other hand has been a hands down STAPLE in my life since I was a teenager.  I have never been disappointed and come here time and time again every time I am in Chicago.  This is my favorite go to restaurant for any occasion: dates, friends, entertaining out of towners, bdays etc.
