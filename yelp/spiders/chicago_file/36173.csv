Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////And if all of that wasn't enough . . . they have GOLDBRICK sundaes for dessert.  What?  You don't know about this culinary delight?  Well if you go . . .order one . . order two . . that's how good this is.  Whiskey ice cream (where do they come up with this stuff?) served with the chocolate and nut goldbrick sauce that you pour over the ice cream to form a hard crunchy shell.  I haven't had one of these since I lived up in Wisconsin and I think I'd come back here just for this even if the rest of the food wasn't so good!
