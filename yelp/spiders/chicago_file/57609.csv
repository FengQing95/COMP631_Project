Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The menu was big. Like reallllly big. There were breakfast/brunch options on one side, and then more lunch/dinner options on the other. Lots of dishes to choose from. We split three pitchers of sangria between the six of us throughout the brunch and it was delicious. We got the regular house red and the white peach. They don't put way too much ice in their pitchers like you see at some places, for which everyone was thankful.
