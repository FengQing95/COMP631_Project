Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I can't say enough about this delicious pizza. I was here from Maryland to attend my niece's graduation.  My husband decided to go to this restaurant for a late night dinner.  When he brought the pizza back to our hotel, I instantly woke up after being up for about 20 hrs (with traveling included). I couldn't get enough of the pizza, the taste was awesome.  We had the pizza with the layer of spinach on the bottom and fresh tomatoes on top.  I was only in Chicago for a very short time, we left the next evening.  I kept talking about this pizza on my job. When someone from my job told me that THEY DELIVER........omg, it was on! I ordered six today to be sent to my home in Maryland.  Can't  wait to bake them in MY oven and enjoy!  THANK YOU for the exerperience Lou Malnati's Pizzeria!
