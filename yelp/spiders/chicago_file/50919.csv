Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our waitress came over and took our drink order and we were deciding what size we wanted; she seemed like she was in a hurry to leave our table and said our 1/2 pitcher of sangria was good and we can always order more. I would have liked for her to at least tell us about the sangria of the day but thats okay.
