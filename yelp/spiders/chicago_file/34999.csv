Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For sides, we went with the creamed spinach and elote style corn. The spinach was wonderful and had a nice crust from the broiler on it that was almost like a brûlée topping. The corn, as many reviewers have noted is wonderful. For dessert we went with the malted whiskey ice cream. Get this! It's so good.
