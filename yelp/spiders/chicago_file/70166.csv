Little Goat Diner////I was also very intrigued by the smoked pork & toffee milkshake, so I had to try it. Toffee lovers must try this. I felt like a candy store exploded in the bottom of my milk shake. There was a hint of smokiness from the pork, but if you didn't tell me that pork was in the milkshake I wouldn't have known.
