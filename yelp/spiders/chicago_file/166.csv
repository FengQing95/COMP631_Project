Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////We were sat at a table, water glasses already filled (LOVE that!) and our server (who was obviously very busy) stopped by quickly to introduce herself and say she would be right with us. As a server, I love that she took the time to stop and let us know she would be with us ASAP rather than leaving us hanging.
