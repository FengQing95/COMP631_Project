Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been here a few times and have never been disappointed. Fun atmosphere (maybe a few too many bachelorettes, though). Not too noisy, not too quiet, which is great. I've never had to wait very long - I either plan ahead and make a reservation, or come in the winter on a week night.
