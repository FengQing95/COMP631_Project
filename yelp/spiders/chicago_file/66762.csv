Little Goat Diner////My wife and kids (12 and 14) happened to be in town during the week so we all went there for lunch. Awesome and even suitable for teens. Â I had the korean burger with Kimci and a fried egg. You have to have acquired a taste for kimci but the burger was pretty good. My daughter had the buffalo burger (not buffalo meat, buffalo sauce) and it was awesome! Going back just for that. Smoked fries are a must.
