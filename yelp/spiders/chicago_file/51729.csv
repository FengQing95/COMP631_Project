Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Very underwhelming for all the reviews we saw. My boyfriend and I ordered grilled squid  (way too salty), beef tenderloin with blue cheese (beef was dried and tough), Brussel sprouts salad (too much cheese, made the dressing too creamy and the beef empanada, which was delightful. The desserts were below par as well. We ordered caramelized banana and the flan, it just didn't have a lot originality.  The good part was that we got the desserts for free as a part of checking in via yelp. Overall, not very good food and was a disappointment given all the rave reviews.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong things?
