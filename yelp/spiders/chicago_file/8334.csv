Art Institute of Chicago////The Steve McQueen exhibit was spectacular--great in the work itself and they way it was presented by the museum. The rooms for some of the videos were amazing sound-proof rooms accessed by a Z maze entry to shield the noise to the outside. Other museums should see this set-up and follow suit.
