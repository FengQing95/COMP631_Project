Little Goat Diner////Believe the hype, ladies and gents. This was recommended by one of my friends when we brunches a couple of weeks ago and we got a reservation of for 4. Yooo, the best thing on their menu were these perogies and I CANNOT find it on the website to save my life. The next best thing were definitely the Everything is Everything Crumpets, and that shit was definitely everythinggg. This place turned my diet into an ultimate fail. We also tried This Little Piggy Went To China, but I'll admit we weren't too in love with it. I understood where they were going with this, but I definitely think the sauce they used had too much of an oriental flavor that overpowered everything else that was going on with the meal. Another thing that was a miss was serving the Hot Crab Dip with Ritz. Such a poor decision because the dip was amazing and would've been so fire with a baguette or something. All together, the service was great and I can't stop thinking of this place. Glad I came and I'll definitely need to make my second rounds here soon.
