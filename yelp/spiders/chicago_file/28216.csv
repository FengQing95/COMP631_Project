Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Once we got seated we ordered the Lou without mushrooms. When we got our pizza it was covered in mushrooms and it was barely luke-warm. I think it would have been better if it was hot but the cheese wasn't even melty like a pizza should be. I was definitely disappointed as I had been looking forward to this pizza for sometime. Not sure if it was the location, how busy it was or the pizza itself...
