Smoque BBQ////Half slab of baby back ribs + Texas sausage + sliced brisket + fries + barbecue beans + cole slaw = well...let's just say a decent-sized lunch.  I could have eaten more, but I have to show SOME restraint, right?  Actually, I intended to order the peach cobbler but forgot.  And then I was too intent on my own food to snare a bite of my friend's before she finished.  Next time!
