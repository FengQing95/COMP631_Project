Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////TIP on reheating meat: Don't nuke it in the microwave! It will lose all of its texture. Instead, seal it in a ziplock baggy with the air sucked out and run hot tap water (hottest the tap can get) over it until you've reached the desired temperature. Then, give it a very quick sear in a very hot, heavy pan.
