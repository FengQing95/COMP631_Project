Little Goat Diner////I LOVED LITTLE GOAT!!!! The atmosphere and vibe of the place was perfect. We made a reservation earlier in the day for 10 people and luckily got a table. Unfortunately, we still ended up having to wait 30 minutes past our reservation to get seated. But. The food and service more than made up for it. The place is really cute and spacious. The food was delicious. Breakfast all day-- which is one of my favorite things ever. Their burgers are great. French fries are great. The Caesar salad was one of the best I've ever had. Rail drinks were a little pricey, but I get it, it's New York. Bathrooms in the back through a door that's blended into the wall
