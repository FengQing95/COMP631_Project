Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We were finally seated in the bar where the bartender waited on us. Upon being seated, we were asked again if we were celebrating anything so I reminded them it was my boyfriend's birthday. After a quick meal with impersonal service, we received a 'complementary' piece of pie- mind you, we were celebrating a birthday that wasn't acknowledged.
