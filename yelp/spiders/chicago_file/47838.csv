Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went here for brunch and really enjoyed the experience! I love the tapas style. It's a great way to try a variety of things, especially when everything sounds so good and you can't decide what to order. The DIY Bloody Mary station is awesome too! The space is huge so this is a great spot for brunch to avoid having to wait forever to be seated.
