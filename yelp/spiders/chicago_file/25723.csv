Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Got the classic chicago, it has a layer of cheese, sausage, then sauce on top.  The crust was great, very buttery and crisp.  Though before I even took a bite I was pretty certain the tomatoes were frozen, just from the appearance.  I am pretty sure that I'm right after tasting.
