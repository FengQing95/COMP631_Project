Little Goat Diner////I stopped by Little Goat Bakery this past weekend after hearing they were debuting some new sweets. I picked up a chocolate whoopie pie, honey graham cupcake, and coffee cake muffin. The whoopie pie was superb! Five stars for this confection. The cake portion was chocolatey and moist and the chocolate cream had a nice, light texture and great chocolate flavor as well. Neither component was too sweet either. The honey graham cupcake was good. The crumb was more rustic compared to the dense, fine crumb of the cupcakes at Sprinkles. The texture of the frosting was also lighter and not as sweet as Sprinkles' frosting so some may prefer the cupcakes here. The other cupcake option this past Saturday was Mexican chocolate. The coffee cake muffin tasted as you would imagine a coffee cake in muffin form would. I liked the abundance and large size of the crumbles atop the muffin, and the flavor was enjoyable with the rivers of cinnamon throughout. However, the cake portion of the muffin was a touch more dry than I would like. If you want an awesome muffin, head over to the bakery counter at Summer House. I love their banana muffin and pumpkin muffin. There were a couple other muffin options for sale I believe, one of which may have been gluten free. A common theme I noticed after noshing everything I bought was that nothing tasted overly sweet. I really appreciated that because I love sweets but I don't want to necessarily feel like I swallowed a bag of granulated sugar when I eat treats. The three items together were about $8 which I felt was very fair for the size and quality of the items I purchased. I will definitely stop in again for that whoopie pie and to try some other bakery items. Recommend!
