Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Been here twice and have always had a great experience- service is friendly, not fast (but at tapas bar speed), the food is good, and the sangria is excellent. We had the omeletta (very good), chicken and beef empanadas (very good), the scallops (very good), the meat plate (good), meatballs (very good) and the stuffed mushrooms (OK). Also had the butterscotch dessert, which was small but excellent. Overall, a very pleasant dining experience.
