Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We got some drinks, they were fine, very sweet. I like more of a bite in my cocktails. I got the filet. I didn't love it! I was so bummed as everyone said how great it would be! I think many people would love it though. I'm such a steak house guy I love a simple, well cooked, great piece of meat. This was a little heavier than I would have liked for a steak, cooked in butter etc. It was a nice dish for someone who likes that sort of thing.
