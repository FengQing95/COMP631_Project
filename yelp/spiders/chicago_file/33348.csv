Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////In the client meal we ordered the Grande Tower, which has oysters, crab and lobster.  This was awesome and worth the money.  We also had the broccoli and sweet potatos.  The sweet potatos were awesome... almost dessert like.  The broccoli tasted a bit strange.  Having had a large lunch prior to this dinner, I wanted to keep it light, so I order the Salmon.  It was tasty and fresh, but probably not the best thing on the menu.
