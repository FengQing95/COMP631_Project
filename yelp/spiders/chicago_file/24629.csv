Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Upon visiting Chicago, Lou Malnati's was the highly touted deep dish spot that we wanted to try. I don't know what it was when we went.. If it was too busy, they were understaffed, or for some reason that escapes me, but our experience was less than par that left a sour taste in my mouth. The wait was expected, but what wasnt was the seating of multiple 4 tops before my party even though we clearly put our name down first. It was only until I went inside and ask the hostess about it was when we finally got a table. Maybe it was really coincidental that our table just came up when I decided to ask, who knows.
