Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This has to be hands down one of my favorite food experiences. When I ordered the cheese bread, I was not expecting cheese, spinach, and tons of yumminess to ooze out. It was beautiful! The Chicago-style pizza was also delicious; it was much better than anything I've had back home in Texas. Service was great, and our waitress was helpful. The ambiance was casual. I would definitely return.
