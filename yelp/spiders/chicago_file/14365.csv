Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Alright so the two stars is for the service, not the food.  The pizza and lasagna were good, but the service was absolutely awful.  We called around 10 PM on a Monday (yes, a Monday) and they put us on hold for 5+ minutes.  We were already walking there so we hung up and walked in.  The place was dead, so we had no idea why we had been placed on hold for so long.
