Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////A lot of people told me to check this place out, so a group of my friends and I went to check it out. I love the look and feel of this place. I went around lunchtime and it was busy and felt like a pub, was lively and had a lot of cool memorabilia surrounding the place. I ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic. It was super filling and tasty. I thought it could have used a bit more of flavor, while it was good, I thought it could have been a little better. This place had one of the best bloody marys we had during our whole stay in Chicago though!
