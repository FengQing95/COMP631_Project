Smoque BBQ////not really sure what else to say.  There are a handful of very good rib joints in the city, but the STL ribs from Smoque are about as good as it gets.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because I would like more of a bar/rest atmosphere.  If you could put Smoque's ribs in the Smoke Daddy room I would be in heaven.
