Art Institute of Chicago////I've been to many museums in many different towns and the collection at the Art Institute is second to none. Even if you know nothing about art, you are going to recognize many of the iconic paintings on display here. A few of the highlights include Grant Wood's American Gothic, Georges Seurat's A Sunday on La Grande Jatte, Edward Hopper's Nighthawks (Wulfgar!), Henri Matisse's Bathers by the River and Pablo Picasso's Old Man with Guitar (Keith Richards?)
