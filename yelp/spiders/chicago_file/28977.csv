Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After polling from locals, Uber drivers, my friends who visited Chicago before, I have decided to try Lou Malnati's pizza over the other chains that are around town. Since we had a tight schedule, we didn't want to wait in line and wait for the pizza to cook when we order, so we decided to call in and ask for to-go.
