Little Goat Diner////First of all, I think that being able to see into the kitchen through the large windows is awesome. Maybe not for the people trying to actually work, but for the curious guest, it was a nice design. This place has a great vibe that makes me think of an old diner that got turned upscale. It has booths and tables, and the completed orders are delivered through a long open window that is in view from the seating area just like you would expect from a little southern diner, but it is decorated very modern and a lot of thought obviously went into the design.
