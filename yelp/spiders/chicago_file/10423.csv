Art Institute of Chicago////These are some of his earlier works. Already developed were many of his most important themes of "hiding in plain sight" and illogical compositional elements, windowpane presentation and wordplay. Not included in this exhibit are a lot of bowler hats and green apples which are a big part of his total lexicon. But no matter, the exhibit is phenomenal. I plan to visit again before its done in October.
