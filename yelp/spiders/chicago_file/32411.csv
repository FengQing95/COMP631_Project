Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Delicious deep dish pizza!!!! We called ahead to give the restaurant a heads up that we were coming with a large group because they don't take reservations. When we got there, the place wasn't packed so we were able to get seated immediately. We took over three tables inside during lunch. The salad was delicious and the veggie deep dish was my favorite though I'm not vegetarian. I miss Chicago and the deep dish pizza there!!
