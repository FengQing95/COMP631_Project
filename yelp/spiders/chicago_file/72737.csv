Little Goat Diner////Definitely a fun place to go but I wouldn't suggest going if you are a vegetarian. There is like one salad and one veggie burger I was able to eat. food is great don't get me wrong but there weren't a lot of options for me. My brother, on the other hand, said it was the best burger he ever had and we needed to go back!
