Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I am not from Chicago and wanted to try some deep dish pizza on a vacation with my girlfriend. We tried deep dish from three different places and Lou's was very good but actually my least favorite of the group. It seemed hard to find a place in Chicago with bad food. The staff was very friendly and accommodating and the prices were great for what you get. I just wish their beer selection was a little better.
