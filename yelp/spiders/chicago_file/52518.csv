Smoque BBQ////I love making myself miserable by eating $30 worth of smoked meats. How stereotypically American of me. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu save for the salad maybe. Roughage? Pfft. If you're going to Smoque, you know exactly what you're doing and this is the best way to do it.
