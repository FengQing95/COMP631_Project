Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For the most part, this location is filled with people who live in the River North and/or the Loop surrounding areas, so you have your local Chicago peeps, coupled with a few tourists. Yes, people come from all over the city, but I like that this place has more "locals" than tourists. I also like the diversity of the crowd here and the cool vibe that the restaurant offers. This isn't NYC pizza, so don't expect that kind of pizza here. Hey, this is Chicago where we invented deep-dish pizza that you eat with a fork and knife!
