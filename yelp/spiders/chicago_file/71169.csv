Little Goat Diner////After a few visits to the Little Goat we found the food to be great. Although, I do caution to be aware of what you order. The Goat Burger is one of the best burgers in the city. The Fish Tostadas are to die for. Their fries are great. There were a few items that we did not like, but overall the food was amazing.
