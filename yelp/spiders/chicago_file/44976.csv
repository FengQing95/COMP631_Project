Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Service was subpar and inadequate, and mainly the reason I will not return. The food was great! Except it came to the table a bit cool. Waited 2+ hours, which wouldn't have been a problem if the hostesses were friendly. However, they seemed irritated with our presence. I honestly felt like my friends and I were not paid full attention to because of our age. We are not of drinking age, and I think we were discriminated against because of this. Our waiter, although friendly at first, was not attentive, nor did he provide adequate information on general tapas knowledge, despite us telling him it was our first tapas experience. When we asked him to split the bill, he basically told us that we could figure it out ourselves and write down on the receipt what he should charge each of our cards. Was disappointed because it could have been such a nice experience.
