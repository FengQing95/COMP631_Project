Little Goat Diner////The food was delicious and priced moderately.  The service was friendly and helpful. We waited for 20 mins. for our seats - on a weekend, which isn't bad.  We ordered Hot crab dip, brussels sprouts, Mushroom Ragout and fish tostadas. It's a casual place to have dinner with friends.  The atmosphere and decor is okay.., nothing unique or interesting, but not your greasy diner either.
