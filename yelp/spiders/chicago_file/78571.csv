Little Goat Diner////For dessert, we stopped by sugargoat which is connected to Little Goat. We got the Blueberry brown butter cupcake, the Pancake cupcake, the lemon cookie, the chocolate crinkle cookie (more brownie than cookie!) & the spiced brown butter pecan cookie. As usual, all were good but the blueberry cupcake and lemon cookies were our favorites.
