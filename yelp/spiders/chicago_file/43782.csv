Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////one thing i've noticed about Chicago, this city knows how to feed you in terms of quantity. expect large portions. finishing a pitcher of sangria never was quite the chore, but in this case it seemed never ending. pintxo platters are great you get about six bit-size tapas- chorizo wrapped medjool date & manchego, ahi tuna poached in olive oil on avocado toast, goat cheese croqueta,short rib-stuffed piquillo pepper, mushroom & rice croqueta, artisanal spanish cheese & quince. patatas bravas & grilled squid were my absolute favorite. and for dessert, dessert pintxo platter- profiterole, raspberry sorbet, crema catalana, fruit pound cake, marcona almond tart, spanish brownie- was a nice ending to our meal.
