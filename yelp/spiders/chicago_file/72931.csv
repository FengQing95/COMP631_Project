Little Goat Diner////Came here on a Monday afternoon. I did not know what to expect. I only knew I wanted something different from the ordinary and boy did I get it. I ordered the Bahn Mi Beef burger with Pork Belly fries. Deeeeeeeelllllllliiccciiioouusssss!!!! My friend ordered the fish tostadas and broccoli. Everything was great!! I recommend coming here if you're in a mood for something different.
