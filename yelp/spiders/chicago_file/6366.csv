The Purple Pig////Have wanted to come here so many times when I have visited Chicago and was very excited to finally go. One of my favorite meals ever. The bread might have been the best ever--the focaccia and cornbread were amazing and the truffle butter was perfect. Also had the burrata, tuna tartare and the pork chop. Everything was tasty and beautiful.
