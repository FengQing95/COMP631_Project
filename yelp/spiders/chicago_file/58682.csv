Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is a tapas restaurant through and through, but the star of the show for me is the paella.  I've ordered a couple different paellas, and they have all been tremendous.  You have to order it.  Some other recommendatons: waffle-battered chicken stick (brunch), brussel sprout salad, and the chroizo wrapped date from the pintxos menu.
