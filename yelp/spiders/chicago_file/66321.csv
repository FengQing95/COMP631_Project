Little Goat Diner////EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT LIL' GOAT these days. Its not really that great. I was very underwhelmed when I ordered two of the most popular items (according to our waitress) from the menu. The Fish Tostadas are based on a very oily and thick disk of fried dough which was a bit gross. I'm not sure why this was described as a "soft roll". The "chickpea-onion" slaw on top of the fish sounds so great, but seemed to be just made up of unsalted chickpeas with no flavor at all? I couldn't figure out how they added to the dish. The "Los Drowned" braised beef sandwich looked good at first until we discovered massive chewy globs of gelatinous fat attached to the beef. Why couldn't the kitchen trim this off? Is this expected to be eaten/ choked down? We ended up dissecting the sandwich to trim the beef ourselves (the beef did at least taste great) and ended up eating the sandwich components separately. The Boo Boo Baise was quite good though and the garlic cheese bread was also great, too bad I couldn't have just eaten those.
