Little Goat Diner////Little Goat never disappoints. Their staff is all up to speed on their unique menu offerings and their friendly and positive attitudes are infectious. The host stand was very friendly and helpful in letting us know that we were next to receive an outside table and that they would find us in the bar when it was ready.
