Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is a nice little place for sure.  During the summer you can eat outside and enjoy glass after glass of sangria (their's was ok).  The food was decent as well, and the servers are knowledgable of the menu.  The only down side is they pack a ton of tables in a small amount of space, and you can nearly share your meal with the neighboring table without standing up.
