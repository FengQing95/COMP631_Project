Art Institute of Chicago////I just wanted to add a note about the Jeff Wall exhibit which is opening 6/29. Wall is a brilliant photographer/digital artist and this show features his large-scale lightbox photos. I saw the exhibit this spring in NYC and was very excited to hear that it would be showing in Chicago, too!
