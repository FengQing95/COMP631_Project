Little Goat Diner////Little goat diner!!! This place has some of the most unique menu items I've ever seen. We went for brunch and got the breakfast burrito. Not much of a burrito, but amazing nonetheless with really delicious and unique flavors and ingredients. Our waiter was really knowledgeable and patient with my questions. The fries were okay, I would choose the hash browns next time. We also got the glass noodles with a veggie patty and that was really good. Overall, a terrific meal and overall great experience
