Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We order AGAIN and then he comes back to our table about 15 minutes with pizza plates and appetizer plates and my boyfriend goes, "you do realize we already ate - we are just waiting for our chocolate chip cookie pizza." He tells us that they make him bring out plates to everyone who's ordering dinner.
