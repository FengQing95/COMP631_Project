Smoque BBQ////I have to admit, I was kinda put off by the seemingly small portion of mac n cheese and cobbler served in mini muffin tins. Portion control never goes over well with me. However, as soon as I started to get a taste of everything, I was pretty full and didn't think I can finish the cobbler.
