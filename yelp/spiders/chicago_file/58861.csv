Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////What a great place! Really enjoyed the chorizo-wrapped dates, french toast, and the waffle fries chicken in particular! All to die for! The paella was tasty and a fun table-side order. Honestly it could be the entire meal for two people. Really enjoyed our brunch, and highly recommend!
