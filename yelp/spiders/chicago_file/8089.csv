Art Institute of Chicago////If you're looking for a place to eat while at the museum, don't do it here. It's expensive, and worst of all, it's dirty. I ordered a hot tea ($5+!) and was handed a glass that was so dirty, I could see from a distance that it was not suitable for drinking out of . When I asked for another cup, and was given a second glass only slightly less dirty than the first. I could actually scrape dark particles of something (I'm guessing food?) from the outside of the cup.
