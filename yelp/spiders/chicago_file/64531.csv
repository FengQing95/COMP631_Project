Smoque BBQ////Food wise, I ordered the chopped brisket platter with the Mac and cheese and baked beans for my sides. Mac and cheese, amazing! Loved the toasted bread crumbs on top and it was the perfect balance of creamy cheese with noodles. From reviews I knew their baked beans were cooked in the smoker and I enjoyed the smokey flavor the beans had. The slaw was good. I usually prefer a creamy slaw but the vinegar based slaw was a perfect compliment to the meal. The chopped brisket was great. I'm a fan of the Tennessee BBQ sauce and once I put some of that on the brisket, I was in heaven.
