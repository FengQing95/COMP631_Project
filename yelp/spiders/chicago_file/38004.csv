Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The service was impeccable. Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgable. We started our meal with Belle Meade old fashioneds and the baked goat cheese.  Smooth and well balanced, it was the best old fashioned that I have ever had. The baked goat cheese was fantastic.  For our main course, my husband ordered the dry aged bone in ribeye, which was HUGE. I ordered the petite filet mignon - duchess cut, which was the perfect size for me. Both were delicious and perfectly cooked. I enjoyed the roasted tomato on the side.  We also had the wild mushrooms.  They were seasoned well and quite tasty.   For my husbands birthday, they brought him chocolate ice cream with a sparkler. But that was the perfect end to our night.
