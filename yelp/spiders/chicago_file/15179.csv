Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's was my second Chicago deep-dish experience. And it was the better of the two. Lou's pizza had a dense, thick crust, unlike anything I'd had before. I had the butter crust. It was tasty, but a bit much. The toppings were delish too. It was a good pizza, but I didn't fall in love. Very good, though.
