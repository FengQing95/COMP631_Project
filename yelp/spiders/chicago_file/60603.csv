Smoque BBQ////I ended up ordering the Beef Brisket with a taste of some St. Louis Ribs.  The Beef Brisket was damn good.  Super moist, smokey black crust, thick cut, with great spice rub/BBQ sauce.  The brisket easily breaks apart with your fork and I was smiling with every bite.  The taste of ribs included a quarter slab, which was plenty as the St. Louis were meaty.  The ribs were fall off the bone tender and the smokey crisp crust has great flavor.
