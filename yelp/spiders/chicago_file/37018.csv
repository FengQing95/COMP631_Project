Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Food....I kid you not, it's served FAST!!! Starters came out less than 7min. We ordered Garlic Shrimp and roasted Bone morrow. Remember this, if there's one thing you need to eat here, it's the bone morrow! We've never had before either. Garlic shrimp was on point, thick garlic butter sauce was amazing. Steaks are 5stars, meat loaf is so yummy!
