Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Came here on a Friday right after work (630) Â to celebrate a great week. No reservations so we weren't sure what to expect - they asked for our number and said we could sit anywhere at their two bars. Loved siting at the cozy lower level bar with friendly and knowledgeable bar tenders! The drinks were top notch and well crafted. The food was excellent. The bacon was some of the best I've ever had. The steaks were top notch. Everything was of the highest quality. I even loved their place settings too :) I can't wait to come back!
