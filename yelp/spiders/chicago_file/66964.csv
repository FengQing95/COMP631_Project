Little Goat Diner////I was really excited to come here, and I also realized I had come here a few years prior with my parents, but I couldn't remember how the food was so I wanted to try it again. The waitress was really nice. I had no problems with the service. He was friendly and attentive. As for the food, unfortunately the dish "Little Piggy Went to China" I felt was creative and unique, but it was extremely salty. There was an overpowering tangy taste to the dish (maybe in the sauce?) and I couldn't really taste the biscuit or egg which was disappointing. My friends ordered the Elvis Pancakes and the Dark Chocolate pancakes which I got to try and Â I thought they were good. I do feel like the bacon in the Elvis pancakes should've actually been a little salty rather than sweet so that it could balance out the sweetness of the rest of the dish. I also ordered a shake, which was good. But, even though I ordered only two things, my total came out to nearly $30, which I felt was overpriced especially since the "Little Piggy Went to China" dish was actually fairly small. I think I would give this place another shot, but I would like to try it for breakfast. I would also like to try Girl and the Goat. I know owner Stephanie Izard won Iron Chef, which I think is awesome and I'm a huge fan of food network. That being said, I would be willing to try more.
