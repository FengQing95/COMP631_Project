The Purple Pig////When we sat down the waitress was quiet and the restaurant was noisy so we were a bit confused about how the restaurant worked, but we quickly figured it out. You order "small" plates to share, typically 3-4 plates for two people and then the servers bring them to your table to share as the chef makes them. We decided to try different dishes from different sections. Delicious!!
