Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My friend and I headed over to Care Ba-Ba-Reeba yesterday evening, which was a Sunday, for a girl's night out. We were greeted by a friendly host staff and got lucky when a party cancelled giving us immediate seating at a 4-top table on the outside patio. Our server was friendly and welcoming. He explained all the specials carefully and was extremely knowledgeable about every menu item we asked about (and we asked about quite a few). We were having a hard time deciding which flavor of sangria to have (passion fruit vs. pear) so he brought us two small samples to try before we committed to a pitcher which we both thought was very nice of him to do. After going with the passion fruit, we ordered two plates each and received a free order of spicy potatoes because my friend was on their mailing list. The food was absolutely delicious and tasted exactly how the server described. The ingredients were fresh and were the right temperature. The plates were brought out in pairs and were spaced out which allowed us to enjoy it all without feeling rushed.
