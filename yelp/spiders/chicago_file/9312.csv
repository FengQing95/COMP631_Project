Art Institute of Chicago////Previous reviewers have covered the wonders of the Art Institute very well. I have to add my two cents, though, to recommend the lectures, concerts and tours. Take a look at the AIC's online calendar and you'll notice they have lectures given by noted art experts three or four days a week, and often in the evenings or on weekends, too. And the Avalon Quartet and other musical groups give beautiful, free or moderately priced concerts. Listening to classical music under the stained glass dome in Fullerton Hall is my idea of heaven.
