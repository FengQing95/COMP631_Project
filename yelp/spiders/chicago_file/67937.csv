Little Goat Diner////We had the little goat cater the bread for a luncheon at our office.  This was a great decision made by the bosses.  The bread chosen was the Wheat, Broccoli Cheddar, and the Spicy Sun-dried tomato.  Each loaf had much personality and the taste was very interesting and well made.  Would absolutely choose the Little Goat for their loaves in the future.
