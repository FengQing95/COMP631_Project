Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I know I know, everyone loves it here, not original, but its always my go to place when friends visit and birthdays come around. As a vegi there is plenty for me to choose from, such as the stuffed mushroom caps and the crispy spicy potatoes which if it didn't look trashy, would order all night.
