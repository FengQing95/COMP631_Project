Smoque BBQ////The pulled pork and fries, however, as the reason that I'm giving Smoque only three stars. The pulled pork was simply not that great - dry and a little flavorless, even with the little tub of sauce drizzled all over it, and the bun was nothing to write home about. The fries were only a little above lukewarm when we got them, and they were drenched in oil - twisting it a little bit resulted in squeezing drops of oil out.
