Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////My friends and I make an annual trip to Chicago and we usually sleep long past the point which a normal person would eat breakfast. However, this year we decided to make it a point to be up and moving in time for breakfast. This decision led us to Wildberry Cafe and I could not have been happier. It's easy to find (just a few blocks to the east of the red line off State and Lake) and right across from Millennium Park. The wait was approximately 40 minutes but it was Sunday morning and it passed quickly. The service was fantastic, our server was attentive but not overbearing. As for the food ... well honestly there are few words to describe the food, I will simply say spot - on and delicious. I highly recommend the Southern Eggs Benedict. They were a plateful and every bite was scrumptious. More importantly, if you eat here, you must order some of the "Berry-bliss pancakes." It is what they are known for and words simply do not do them justice. They were sweet, but not to the point they could not be finished.
