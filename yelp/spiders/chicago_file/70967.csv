Little Goat Diner////As a diner lover, when a group of friends and I came in Little Goat at 12am, I quite simply wasn't prepared for their food to be as delicious as it was, or for their staff to be so attentive and on top of it. I have to say that what most impressed me about this restaurant was their dedication to having high standards for their food.
