Little Goat Diner////My partner enjoyed his crazy kimchee & bacon & eggs & pancakes thing, and he also loved his oh god, goat chili. Due to all the cute goat mascots plastered everywhere, that one weirded me out for a little bit. It didn't stop me from stealing a bit of the crunchy topping off his chili which was really tasty, lime-infused or something.
