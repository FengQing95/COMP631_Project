Smoque BBQ////yum yum yum. it is everything that everyone says it is and more. at first i was a little weirded out at the spices b/c those are completely baked on top and it looks like it's burned, but it grew on me and was really good. the mac and cheese is great, and i also got to try the cobbler and the cornbread. i love how it comes in just the right serving size.
