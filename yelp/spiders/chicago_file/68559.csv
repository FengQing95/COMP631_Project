Little Goat Diner////We ordered- 3 bloody marys, 1 mimosa, Fat Elvis Waffles, Pork Belly Benedict, Indian Burrito thing, Kimchee/eggs/bacon, and sourdough waffles + 2 orders of goat cheese hash browns and a side of bacon. Gluttonous to say the least! Â We were all very full and extremely happy. Most definitely will return to try more of the menu.
