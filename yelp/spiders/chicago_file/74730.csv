Little Goat Diner////I am not an american breakfast kind of girl but hearing a lot of raves from my friends, I thought I might give this place a try. This place was packed on a sunday morning and the wait was 20 minutes. I thought to myself "wow, this place is packed and people are willing to wait this long to eat here then the food must be fantastic." Oh boy, was I WRONG. I ordered the chocolate chip pancakes and a side of hash browns. The pancakes were too sweet Â and my hash browns were burnt. On top of bad food, food was expensive. This place disappoint me more than my grades disappoint my mom.
