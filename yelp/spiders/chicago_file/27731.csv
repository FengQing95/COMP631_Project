Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I told my concierge that I was in the mood for Chicago deep dish pizza and he recommended this spot, which was about 4 blocks from my hotel. It certainly didn't disappoint. I ordered a small Malnati Chicago Classic Pizza. It takes about 35 minutes to prepare. It was worth the wait. The pizza is so thick and cheesy I could only eat 2 pieces.
