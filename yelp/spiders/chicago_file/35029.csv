Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////When he came back with our drinks, he asked if we were ready.  He wanted to take our order all at once to "make it easier on the kitchen." (wow).  He reassured us that it would be spaced out but dude just wanted to get out of there.  We had 2 drinks, 1 bottle of wine, 2 apps, and 2 entrees all put on our table in 45 minutes. (!)  I don't know about everyone else, but when I go to a steakhouse, I like to enjoy the experience and relax.  They should have just given us a feed bag and said "we gotta get this all down" while shoving the food down our throats.
