Little Goat Diner////We came here to celebrate a birthday. We had a private room upstairs with a bar, an open kitchen, and access to the roof deck. The evening started with drinks and some dips, then we sat down for a creative and exciting dinner. I ate more food than I thought possible. Salad, empanadas, scallops (my favorite), sea bass, goat and more..one of the desserts was this fantastic whipped sesame and pineapple thing...oh my gosh. I had two. We were able to talk with the chefs between courses and watch them prepare. The environment was friendly and relaxed; waiters were attentive (crucial: when needed). Lovely design, food, and service.
