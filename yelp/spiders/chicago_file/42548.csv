Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food is delicious. I usually order dates, beef with mashed potatoes, potatoes bravas and some seafood. Of course no tapas without a good sangria. I usually get a pitcher of red to share with my friends. Yes, the key word is to SHARE. This is not a place to go alone because you want to try so many things on the menu! From my experience perfect number is 4 and up. However, I would not recommend paella in Cafe Baba Reeba. Don't get me wrong, it is good but for a paella I go to Cafe Iberico (another great tapas place in the downtown Chicago).
