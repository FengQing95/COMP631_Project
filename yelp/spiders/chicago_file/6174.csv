The Purple Pig////Absolutely amazing.  We went here because of the strong reviews and we were not disappointed. Every menu item was fantastic and unique. King crab, pork belly, ribs, tuna tartar, beets, mushrooms, whipped feta - all were fantastic.  Service was timely and informative. Lively atmosphere but not overwhelming.  The only drawback is the setting walking into what appears to be a business center but once inside you might as well be right on the Mile.  A member of our party said it was the best meal she's ever had!  It is that good.
