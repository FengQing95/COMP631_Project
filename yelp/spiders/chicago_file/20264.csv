Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////You cannot go to Chicago and not have a deep dish pizza. The problem is which one do you go to? There's Gino's East, Pizzeria Uno, Lou Malnati's, and Giordano's (although it's stuffed pizza which is slightly different with the extra layer of dough) as the major players to boast as having the best pizza in the city. What is a person to do? Well rely on Yelp of course. Being that Lou's has the best ratings it was worth a try.
