Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went for the first time with two of my friends and had a great time! For our meal, we ordered the breakfast paella, burrata with catalan tomato bread (#20), spicy potatoes (#30), octopus (#43), garlic shrimp (#44), grilled hanger steak (#53), and buttermilk-fried chicken thighs (#64)...pretty much everything that was highlighted in red. For drink, we got a pitcher of peach sangria. Now, it was sweet and delicious, we thought pitcher wasn't gonna be enough cz we wouldn't feel a thing. Welp, after a glass, it hit us LOL. Delicious drinks are the most dangerous, so watch out. For dessert, we got 3 free desserts for checking in on yelp. We got the chocolate truffle cake, natilla flan, and marcona tart. Taste wise, everything was honestly spot on. We did have to try the paella cz that's what they're known for. I loved that the portion was big, but it is definitely hyped, so don't go with high expectations. Octopus and steak was so tender and flavorful, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. All the dishes were full of flavor and texture was on point! Even the potatoes!!! We finished our meal and were highly satisfied cz food was good and portion was just right for the amount we ordered. However, each of us spent a little over $50. I know it is a tapas bar, but we were quite shocked to see the small portion we got compared to the price. I'd definitely say it's on the pricier side. It was good to go as a group of 3, because we got to all try a little bit of everything, but do expect to spend some moola for tasty food!
