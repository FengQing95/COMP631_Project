Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When we started eating the pizza, that's when we knew... this pizza was too good to NOT be considered as pizza better than NY style pizza. However, it was then and there in my mind that I knew for a fact that it was certainly better than California-style pizza. This pizza was just so rich and luxurious. The cheese was insane, nothing like I had experienced with eating pizza before. Nowhere had I experienced such a satisfying yet delicious cheese pull! My girlfriend and I left extremely full and content - we never knew that deep dish pizza could taste so good!
