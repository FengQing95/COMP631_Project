Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The wait to be seated was about 30. No complaints. It was the waiting once we were seated that was the real problem. Waiting for someone to acknowledge us. Waiting for drinks and waiting for our pre-ordered pizza. Pizza took 45 minutes after we were seated. Not that the pizza wasn't good, it's Â that I don't wait for anything that long. There's just no excuse.
