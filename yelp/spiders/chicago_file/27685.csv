Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ordered this very sad and lame Deep Dish pizza on 9/4/2020. It was terrible with barely any cheese on it. Nothing deep about this pizza. Called to inform about the disappointment and was told that a voucher will be mailed. Haven't received anything. Terrible and shameful on Lou Malnati's. Get your act together and live up to your old fame.
