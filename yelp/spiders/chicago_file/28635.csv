Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered a pie with sausage and pepperoni. I would have to say I do like NYC pizza better than the deep dish in Chicago. The best part though about deep dish is the meats. Each bite was covered in meats. The crust was also very tasty. It's definitely a more filling feeling you have when eating this type of pizza.
