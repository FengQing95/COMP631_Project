The Purple Pig////There was a man (hostess? Server?) who walked around with an iPad that I couldn't stop staring at. He was literally shadowing our table and the 3 or 4 tables around us. OBSERVING OUR EVERY BITE. He paced back and forth back and forth staring and studying our plates. I'm gonna assume they have a system to let each other know when we're done with our app and need the entree out, etc. but I hope they come up with a better idea.
