Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had a large Chicago Classic and it lived up to its name in a big way. The crust was just right - well proofed, just enough butteriness and cornmeal, and reasonably thin to perfect the texture. The sauce was what you hope for but rarely get with a great tomato pop. The beer selection is good and the service was outstanding. Every local chain has some locations better than others but this one is where you want to take your New York friends and settle the rivalry.
