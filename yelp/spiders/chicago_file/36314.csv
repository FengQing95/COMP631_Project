Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The Reservation:  Make one.  We made ours for the 5:00pm opening time and the bar was filled by 5:20pm with the tables jammed by 5:45pm; the wait for a 4-top when we left at 6:35 was "maybe an hour and a half" while reservations were filled for later than 9:00 (on a Thursday.)
