Smoque BBQ////We ordered a couple different things to share so that we could get a good feel of the place.  Ribs, brisket, and a pulled pork sandwich.  They were out of peach cobbler (Which is maybe my second favorite thing on Earth) so I was a little miffed.  I thought the ribs were pretty good (better at Smoke Daddy) and the brisket was pretty good (better at Fat Willy's) and I didn't have room for the pulled pork (although the bf said he liked it.) so I don't know how that faired.  The cornbread was dry, the mac and cheese was alright, the baked beans were tasty, the fries were awesome.
