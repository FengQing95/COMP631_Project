Little Goat Diner////With such a great menu and a fun, friendly vibe I would probably be here at least once a week if I lived closer. I would say that after just a single meal it has vaulted to number two on my list of best Chicago brunch options (with North Pond retaining the top spot, at least for now). As such I will definitely be back before too long to try out some of the other dishes that I contemplated ordering... In fact, I think Â I am free tomorrow.
