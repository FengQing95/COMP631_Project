Little Goat Diner////I LOVE THIS DINER!! So happy that Girl and a Goat has a more accessible counterpart ;) This place is a wonderland! There's a bar, bakery and a diner. The decorations are so cheerful and make me feel like I'm Alice in Wonderland! I love the floor to ceiling windows, totally can imagine that that summer will be really fun!
