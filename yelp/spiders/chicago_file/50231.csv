Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Service was excellent all night, save for one time they put down a dish that wasn't ours. We immediately had them take it away. I loved how our many servers brought dishes out one at a time, pacing the meal, instead of serving it all at once. There wasn't room enough on our table for all of the food anyway. When we were finished with our food and just polishing off the sangria, they didn't rush us at all.
