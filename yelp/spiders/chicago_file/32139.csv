Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was the first place we tried after landing and just wow... The garlic parmesian chicken wings to start wrote AMAZING. They were recommended by Llora who was a great server by the way and I'm sure glad I took her rec. I've never tried deep dish pizza nor did I care for it much thinking regular pizza probably tastes better, but I was proven wrong. The deep dish pizza is a different style of pizza so I don't think it's fair to compare the two, but I became a fan after trying it for the first time. Absolutely amazing and fairly priced! 100% would recommend to anyone who is a fan of pizza!! FYI there are multiple locations and copies of this place, so make sure to visit the one on WELLS ST!
