Art Institute of Chicago////I was far too involved with taking yet another look at the Japanese woodblock prints so I have to regret spending too little time viewing the Jasper Johns Gray show. It offers a broad and inclusive look at the his ideas and paintings. It's great being able to compare manipulation of medium, material and form, as viewers able to see the various incarnations of ideas. Can't wait to see it again (and spend too little time viewing yet another spectacular show!)
