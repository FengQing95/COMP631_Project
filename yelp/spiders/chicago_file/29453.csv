Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Second time in Chicago, first time at Lou's. I would definitely come back. The deep dish pizza exceeded my expectations. We got the classic Chicago and added pepperoni and green peppers. I always heard there were very long lines and the wait time could be anywhere up to an hour. We came on a Thursday right before 6pm and it was the perfect time! No wait whatsoever. Our waitress was very nice and attentive and the restaurant had a rustic vibe to it. The pizza was AMAZING. TASTY. The pizza slice held everything so well and did not fall apart. The crust was buttery, not too thick, yet sturdy. Everyone must try when in Chi-town!
