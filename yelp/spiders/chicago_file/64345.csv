Smoque BBQ////What can I say about this BBQ joint??? I have been to Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis, and North Carolina and none compares to my beloved Smoque.  I can't believe I have yet to review this amazing restaurant because It never fails or disappoints.  Even after a  decade of visits I never tire of the incredible food. From the ribs to the mac & cheese and of course the brisket the quality is superior.  My experience tells me that no other state in this country can compare it the barbecue served here in Chicago   I no longer seek barbecue in any other state other than my hometown Chicago.  Smoque you're the absolute best!.
