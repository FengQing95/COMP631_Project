Little Goat Diner////I was in Chicago for 5 days and had breakfast here where they asked if I had allergies and I said yes, Lactose Intolerant, and the Host gave me a menu for this, couldn't believe it.  They were nicer than nice, I was seated and ordered their special homemade oatmeal and berries which was great, creamy and rich made with Almond/Coconut milk  I loved this place and had my morning coffee there daily.  This is a homey feeling restaurant, comfortable with really good healthy food.  Stephanie does it well, have been to her three restaurants with no complaints.  The place is always packed and I know why.
