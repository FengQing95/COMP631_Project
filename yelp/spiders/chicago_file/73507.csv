Little Goat Diner////It's a Stephanie Izard restaurant, so can't be bad. Service was a bit slow and kind of like "you're going to deal with it because we are a popular place." I dig that they serve breakfast all day, although I am more of a lunch person myself. Everything is ala cart so if you order one of their amazing sandwiches, be prepared to order a side of fries for eight dollars. I have to say though for what it is worth, they have the best fountain Diet Coke I have ever had!
