Little Goat Diner////Little Goat is my JAM. I've been here for brunch, dinner, brunch, and more brunch. I almost always get the This Little Piggy Went to China. Its SO good - an explosion of flavors. My mouth is watering typing about it now. I forced myself to branch out and order something else once so I got the Pork Belly Pancake. It was okay but nothing compared to the LPWTC. My companions have always enjoyed their food as well. I'll eventually branch out again and order something else because the whole menu is so unique. Wish I didn't live across the city from this place, I'd be there weekly!
