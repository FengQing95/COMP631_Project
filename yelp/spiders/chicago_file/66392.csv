Little Goat Diner////Went to this place because of the reviews.  The food was good - really fun and interesting. I had Boo Boo Baise which was very tasty! Big problem for me though -   it wasmuch  too noisy.  I was with a big group and you could only hear to talk to the person across from you.  The poor waiter had to lean down to hear each order.  The noise level made this a less than ideal evening I'm afraid.  Also, our party had a vegan in it and the wait staff admitted that the vegan dishes were fried in the same oil as meat. which I guess techinically makes it non-vegan.  I reocmmend it for the food but pleas pelase someone do something about the noise!!
