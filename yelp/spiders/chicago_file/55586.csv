Smoque BBQ////I will compliment the sides and service. The place had a busy, crowded, popular feel to it, but things were organized. You place your order at the register, someone comes and asks if you will need seats, you stand and wait until a seat opens up (they find seats for you), and then wait for your order to get called.
