Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Absolutely LOVE Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! This place is great for date nights, birthday dinners with big groups of friends and when you have out of towners. I may be partial to tapas places because I studied aboard in Barcelona in my college days, but ba-ba-reeba's food is consistantly good. I am yet to be disappointed. I would have to say hands down the bacon wrapped dates are my favorite-simple yet delicioso! And you cannot forget to order the patatas bravas-this dish is a must have since it is on every menu you encounter in Spain.
