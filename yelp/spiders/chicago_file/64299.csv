Smoque BBQ////Let me make this review short and sweet. I've lived in Alabama, Texas, and Kansas City, so I've had my fair share of really good BBQ. I don't know what Smoque is. It's not BBQ. It's trying really hard to be bbq, but the flavors, the texture, and the 'smoke' flavor are just not there. If you're from Chicago you might like it, but if you've ever had real bbq before, this will disappoint (especially cuz it's a bit pricey).
