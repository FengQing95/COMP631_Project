Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////In my humble opinion, I feel like I got my favorite Chicago deep dish pizza experience here. While there are many more places to try and my opinions may change I'm the future, at this moment, this was my favorite deep dish experience. There's just something so different and delicious about their crust here. A lot of other places you go, sometimes you feel like you are getting overwhelmed by the sheer amount of crust and sauce on your pizza. Like literally you are experiencing a waterfall of tomato sauce and the never-ending doughiness of pizza crust. But not here. The best thing I love about this place, hands down, is the uniqueness of the pizza crust. It's light and crispy, almost like eating a pie crust. It is so satisfying to eat. Let me emphasize: SATISFYING. The crispiness is such a fantastic contrast to the cheese, sauce, and toppings. And that's the other thing, this place doesn't go overboard on the sauce. You have the sauce covering the top of the pizza but it's not excessive to the point where everything is becoming soggy. To me, the crust, cheese, topping, and sauce ratio is perfectly balanced. Just writing and thinking about my experience here makes me crave for the taste of a deep dish pizza from here. That's it, I need to make another trip to Chicago lol.
