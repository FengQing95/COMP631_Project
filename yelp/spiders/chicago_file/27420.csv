Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We walked in because my hubby and I were craving Lou's and were really hungry. They were barely busy and we were sat right away... and kept sitting twiddling our thumbs. We waited for ten minutes and walked out after watching employees standing around doing nothing, LOOK at us, hold their conversations, and not even "hey give us one minute, let me get you some water". NOTHING. As a server, I should apply here because clearly these workers aren't struggling for tips during this pandemic because we were certainly of no importance. Give me one good reason to return because I have none. Consider this a zero star review from an industry pissed off "Karen".
