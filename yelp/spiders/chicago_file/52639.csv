Smoque BBQ////I ordered pulled pork sandwich with chili and corn bread. The sauce that came on the pork was very blend no spicing. The part of the pork that I tried without sauce it was very hard to swallow. I had to drench the pork in very water down sauce in order to be able to eat it. Chili was also lacking the kick of spicing, I took one bite of cornbread and left the rest. The person I came with also did not like the food.
