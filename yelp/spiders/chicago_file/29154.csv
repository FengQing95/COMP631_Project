Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great place to take people from out of town, to get some of the best pizza in Chicago!  I don't eat pizza that much otherwise, probably because it is one of the most addictive and calorie heavy foods known to the Midwest.  One piece is half the calories for the day, and you can't just have one!   Usually a crowded experience (lots of tourists) but for a good reason.
