Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Ambience: first of all, the vibes are fabulous. There's a speakeasy feel, especially as you're led through the main dining room, down the stairs, into a below ground room. The lights are dimmed, music is playing overhead, drinks are flowing at both bars, and everyone is having a great time. It's a romantic setting but can also just be a great night out with friends. We sat in a rounded booth with a beautiful wooden table. No white tablecloths, no frills, just great.
