Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been to a LOT of restaurants in Chicago and I hate to go to the same place twice because there are so many amazing places I want to try....but, I've been to Ba-Ba-Reeba three or four times in the last year and I plan to return again soon. I always make my friends from out of town go here. Hands down some of the best food (and sangria) I've ever had. I could list all of the items you MUST try, but this review would go on forever. The sangria is heavenly -- my favorites are peach and cava. They will do a flight of them so you can try multiples if you ask! That's how I discovered my favorites and now I waste no time in ordering a half-pitcher just for me....
