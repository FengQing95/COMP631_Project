Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place lives up to the hype and the high expectations that I had. I made a reservation on OpenTable 2 months in advance and was so excited for the night. We were seated immediately after we arrived and were led down to the basement for an intimate booth table seating. We brought our own wine because it's technically BYOB (except you have to give away a glass to a nearby table). Another table gave us a glass, so we returned the favor.
