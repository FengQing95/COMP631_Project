Art Institute of Chicago////There are three different places to grab a bite to eat on site. From a fancy Italian restaurant with a chef to the midsized caf√© with hot dishes, soups and a grill (This is what we chose as we were pressed for time. Yummy tuna fish on a flaky croissant. Plus a decadent chocolate cupcake.) to a sandwich shop.
