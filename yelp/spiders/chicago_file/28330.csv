Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I usually don't crave deep dish pizza but recommended it to my friends to try it due to the high ratings on Yelp. We ordered the The Malnati Chicago Classic. I have to say that the amount of sauce, cheese and sausage was perfect. All the ingredients balanced each other well and didn't overwhelm each other. I'm also a big fan of sausage and glad that Lou Malnati's was very generous with the amount of sausage that was on the deep dish.
