Smoque BBQ////Then we moved to the Rib Combo. This combo was good except for the coleslaw and the baby back ribs. The baby back ribs were okay. They weren't the best ribs I have ever made nor were they the worst. There could have been more seasoning on it, more smoke, and it was overcooked. People think that ribs are the best when it falls off the bone, but to me that's wrong. The meat should be tender but when you take a bite out of the rib, the rest of the meat should still stick on the bone. That's exactly what the St. Louis ribs did. This was the highlight of the entire meal. These ribs were really good. It was nicely seasoned, you could taste the smoke, and it was perfectly cooked. This platter also had the 2 best sides as well. The BBQ beans were good, but it was just a little too sweet. It could have used more vinegar and mustard to cut down that sweetness. The Mac & Cheese was good as well. It was creamy, cheesy, and rich, just like how every Mac & Cheese should be. The panko topping on top added the crunch the Mac & Cheese needed
