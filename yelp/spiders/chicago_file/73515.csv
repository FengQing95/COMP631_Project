Little Goat Diner////We just stopped in for a drink at their bar but it was a really cute place with a delicious Bloody Mary! Had a very unique taste to it with some unusual ingredients. In retrospect, wish we had ordered something to eat but will have to leave that until the next visit. The bartender was super friendly and offered up some tips on places to visit nearby when I told him we were taking off to walk the neighborhood. I thought prices were very reasonable here too.
