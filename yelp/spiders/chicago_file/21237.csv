Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Also, if you plan accordingly you can even sneak in an order of calamari.  I was with my sister and we split an appetizer of calamari and a personal pizza with spinach and it was JUST ENOUGH.  I think if we had ordered a bigger pizza we would have needed to be rolled out of there.
