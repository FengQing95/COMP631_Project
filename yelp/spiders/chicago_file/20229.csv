Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Arriving just after 1:00pm the patio was open but we opted to eat indoors at the River North location on Wells Street.  Greeted promptly by a friendly young waitress who I honestly couldn't believe was old enough to serve a beer, our waters were filled quickly and my sister opted for a local Goose Island 312 while my aunt and mother chose their standard iced tea.  Orders placed we sat and waited while examining the kitschy bar interior and laughing as the crowd burst into boos while watching the Yankees put up a few runs on the White Sox.
