Smoque BBQ////I was recently on a road trip that hit through the Southern part of the United States, and was understandably excited about passing through BBQ country. And indeed, several times we did stop, and have BBQ, whether in Memphis, rural Mississippi, or New Orleans. And through most of it, I was distraught, asking myself "Is this as good as it gets? This, America's most delicious, most celebrated food - this is as good as it gets?" I won't name the restaurants I frequented on this trip (well, maybe in a different review), but I will say that no, that was not as good as it gets, because Smoque was far, far better. Amazing even. I tried the ribs, pulled pork, the brisket, mac and cheese, and coleslaw, and everything was great. The brisket, especially, is a must try. And the smoke flavor of the ribs was phenomenal. Get there early, because there will be a line out the door. Go, go, go to Smoque.
