Little Goat Diner////I made reservations, as we had tickets to a show at 7:30pm.  Called to say we'd be 3-5 minutes late, said "no problem!"  We walked through the door at 5:02pm.  They told us they were waiting for a few tables to clear, then we'd be sat.  Welp, they sat a whole MESS of walk-ins before us, and then I saw the hostess say, "oh shit, that reservation was 5, it's 5:17!"  Welp, thankfully, they sacrificed a 4-top for the two of us.  We were in our cushy booth at 5:18pm.
