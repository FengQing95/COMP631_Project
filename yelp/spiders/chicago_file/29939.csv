Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As agonizing as it is, the food is always worth it! We ordered a large Malnati Classic deep dish (sausage and tomato sauce on their Buttercrust), a medium thin crust pizza with mushrooms, and a family-size Malnati salad (lettuce, tomatoes, black olives, mushrooms, salami bits, and gorgonzola cheese with vinaigrette and romano cheese) for our group of five. There was plenty to go around with a few slices of each pizza leftover.
