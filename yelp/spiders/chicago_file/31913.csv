Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was lucky enough to hit up some great Chicago eateries right before the pandemic. I knew coming into the city, a must have was a Chicago deep dish pizza. After lots of research and asking the locals, Lou Malnati's was the most popular choice. Â We only had time for one pizza outing since we had other places to try, so we decided to come here. It was in very close proximity to our hotel and close to the Willis Tower which we did a night visit to. We were seated almost right away in the back room. Service was excellent from start to finish.
