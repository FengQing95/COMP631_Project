Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe BBR was the first tapas experience and I enjoyed it. The food is fairly good but after visiting with other restaurants in the city, I'm rating this 3 stars.  Location is great and the ambiance is fun and light hearted. Service is good an fairly inexpensive.  My last visit was with a group of 12 - all whom had travelled in for my wedding from Canada or asia - so I picked up the tab.  We ordered about 25 dishes and the final bill inclusive of many pitchers of Sangria, taxes and tip was about $430.00 - fairly reasonable for the amount of food (about $35pp).
