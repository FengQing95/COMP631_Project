Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is such a beautiful restaurant, the decor is lovely.  The lighting, beautiful wood, and atmosphere make the meal even better.  Our waiter was knowledgeable, friendly, and offered suggestions for our meals.  We had a filet and lamb chops, both beautifully made.  Cocktails were lovely.  We then had a chocolate cream pie that was made by God's own hand.  It was amazing.
