Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Next our server took an exceedingly long time to take our order. Now my qualm is not with her service, but the speed of the service. She herself was extremely nice and helpful, but it seemed that she was second guessing and taking her sweet time despite the rush. We put our order in before we were seated per request of the hostess in the beginning, and was told by our server that it would take 15 minutes to come out. IT TOOK AN HOUR. Tables around us got theirs before us, and to top it off, it was WARM. It was cooled to the point that I was able to pick up the metal pan with my bare hand and the inside most of the pizza was cold. They reheated it for us and gave us a free dessert, but by no means did it compensate for the time we lost waiting for a table and our pizza. We didn't account for the extra hour that we lost instead of exploring Chicago's secrets.
