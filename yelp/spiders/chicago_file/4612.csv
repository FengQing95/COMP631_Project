The Purple Pig////My boyfriend and I got here at around 4:50 pm on a Sunday evening before a Second City Show, and there was no wait. We got seated at the end of a communal table. Our waitress was so friendly, helpful, and efficient. She came over and took our drink orders and then answered a couple of questions we had about the menu. We ordered The Pig Platter, the salt and vinegar fried beef tendon chips, the bone marrow, the octopus, and the pork jowl.
