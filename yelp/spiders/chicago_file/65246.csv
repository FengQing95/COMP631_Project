Smoque BBQ////Located 6 miles out the city, even though it was poppin inside, the wait wasn't too horrible. There were 5 of us and we were seated in about 15 mins and got our food in 25 mins on a busy Saturday night at around 8 pm, so I can only imagine what this place looked at around prime time 6-7pm. The staff here is awesome, very courteous and helpful, this is not a sit down restaurant but there was one guy who would go around asking how many in each party and reserving tables when people got up to accommodate each group which I thought was cool.
