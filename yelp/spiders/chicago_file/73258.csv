Little Goat Diner////"This little piggy..." had sunny eggs and pork sausage with chili garlic chive sauce and blackberries on a sesame cheddar biscuit!!! So happy this little piggy went to China cuz it was so flavorful!! I did think this one was a little too salty though. Sunny eggs york made it's saltiness milder, yet it could be less salty so I didn't have to get so thirsty after lunch.
