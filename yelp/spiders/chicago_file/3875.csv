The Purple Pig////Came here as a rec from a friend. It's a very hip restaurant with tapas that are sharing size. I tried the bone marrow, which was delicious and the cilantro went well with it. We also had the milk pork shoulder. That was good, but the pork was a little salty for me and I wish there was more mashed potatoes! Pig ears were good, can never go wrong with this as an appetizer. And lastly, my favorite dish was the ricotta gnocchi. The noodles and the cheese were the perfect texture together and the tomato sauce was made so well. We scraped the rest of it with bread.
