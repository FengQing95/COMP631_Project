Smoque BBQ////Smoque has the tender, smoked meat that you would find at any pit or shack south of the Mason-Dixon line. I had the scrumptious beef brisket and my buddy had the very tender, moist and succulent pulled pork. I liked the "Heinz 57-A1 Steak Sauce-esque" BBQ sauce on top. The baked beans were good but I wasn't a fan of the dollar bill-sized onions. The mac-and-cheese was cheesy and delicious. The only reason I wouldn't give them the fifth star is due to the lackluster coleslaw and tiny cups.
