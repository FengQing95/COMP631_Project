Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I loved this place.  Service was great, pizza was fabulous and the place was so lively.  Staff was very conscious of your needs.  Always checking to make sure you are ok.  Pizza took quite a while to cook but when it came out it was well worth it.  It was sooo hot and irresistible.  I burned myself on my first attempt so I decided to wait.  We ordered a small pizza as was suggested for 2 people and my husband finished his half while I could barely finish my 1/4 slice of the pie.  In the end we ended up taking it go.  Cost is very reasonable.  One of our cheapest dinners.  Oh we got the classic deep dish.  It was well worth it.  Come hungry.
