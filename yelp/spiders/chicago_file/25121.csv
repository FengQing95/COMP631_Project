Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Brought the family to Chicago for a long weekend and had to get an authentic deep dish pizza. Someone recommended Lou Malnati's to us...so naturally I looked it up on Yelp and saw a solid 4 stars, but also noticed that it is a chain of restaurants, so I was prepared to be a little underwhelmed...My instincts were off. Â This was darn near one of the best pizzas we've ever eaten. We ordered the original deep dish sausage and it was fantastic.
