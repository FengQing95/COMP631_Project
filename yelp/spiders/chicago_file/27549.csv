Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It's decent at Lou's.  For the deep dish there are a few other places I would head to instead if I had the choice.  But Lou's is definitely a staple in Chicago for a reason.  My only issue with their deep dish vs others is that they are a bit too bready.  I like the ones with more sauce and cheese and less crust.
