Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I loved having breakfast here during my trip to Chicago. I went to the one by Millenium Park in the Loop and was eating all weekend, but that didn't deter me from getting their Wildberry Pancakes. So good! You can definitely taste the fruitiness and freshness of the batter. The pumpkiin latte was also really warm and smooth. They are also known for their cheesecake french toast here, but my friend and I ordered the red velvet french toast instead, which we thought was a little too sweet for our liking. The portions are pretty huge so come on an empty stomach. The wait is long (about an hour to hour and half on weekends) so you will probably be pretty hungry by the time you are seated.
