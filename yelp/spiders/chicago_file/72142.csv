Little Goat Diner////The biscuit was not fresh or warm (which surprises me since they have a bakery on sight) but the gravy saved the day- smoked sausage and buttery mushroom- this could have been happiness! The plate, gravy included, wasn't very hot though (it was literally room-temperature food) and it all came out 2 minutes after we placed the order. I think I got someone else's plate- UNACCEPTABLE.
