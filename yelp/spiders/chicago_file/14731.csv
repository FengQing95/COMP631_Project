Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I thought the pizza was alright...not great.  After hearing from several people that Gino's was the touristy place to go and none of the locals eat there, we decided to try Lou's over Gino's and Giordano's (recommended by a local).  The pizza wasn't bad...I got the deluxe.  There seemed to be very little meat on it and almost seemed like a veggie pizza.
