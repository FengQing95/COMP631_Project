Smoque BBQ////This place is probably as good as BBQ gets in Chicago (and I'm a bit disappointed given Chicago has such wonderful food/restaurants/eateries). It's definitely not a top-tier BBQ place. The ribs, brisket, and pulled pork were OK, but could be quite dry and overcooked. The cole slaw was rather enjoyable with a vinegar-based dressing (I'm accustomed to mayonnaise being from the south). The brisket chili was nothing special, with the brisket not adding much to the party. The menu is also more pricey than I'm accustomed to paying for BBQ, but this isn't a large point given it's in/near Chicago.
