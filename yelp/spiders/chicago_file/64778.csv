Smoque BBQ////I advised getting the rib dinner combo. With it, you can also add in brisket and pulled pork for a couple more dollars with the combo. It's really good for sharing since you get the most out of it. The baby back ribs here are fantastic! It's very moist, tender, and falls off the bone. When they cooked it, they soak it up in the bbq sauce and it instantly melts in your mouth. It's bomb! Droollllll... However, I find the St.Louis to be too dry for my liking. The meat was a bit rough. No bbq sauce on it. It's a dry rub. It wasn't as tender as the baby back ribs. Also, I tried their mac&cheese and cornbread for their sides and it was very tasty.
