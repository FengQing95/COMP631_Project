Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////3) However, we had to wait for over an hour until our steak arrived with the side dishes we ordered. Our waiter did pass by at one point apologizing for the delay but when the tables next to you that were seated after us and ordered after us get their food and we don't, it becomes frustrating. When the steak finally arrived approximately an hour and 15 minutes later, it was lukewarm. Not cold enough to send back to the kitchen but not warm either. Additionally, it was already 11PM when we got the steak, we just wanted to be done eating. It would have been a great steak if it were at the right temperature. The delay and the temperature of the steak made us feel like the steak was sitting and it was forgotten for a while.
