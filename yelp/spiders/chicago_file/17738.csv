Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm a New Yorker so I was a little skeptical to start trying the Chicago pizza but I had to! I love pizza and wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I've got to admit, it was so freakin' delicious! We got a deep dish sausage pizza which was so good. Thick but not too thick and just so full of flavor.
