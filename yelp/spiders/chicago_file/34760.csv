Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I was hoping that I would like Bavette's as much as I like Maude's and Au Cheval, but unfortunately this wasn't the case. Â Bavette's is a good place to grab a cocktail - and indeed it is as my friends and I gave the bar a second chance, but when given the choice, I'd still prefer Maude's for my whiskey or gin hankerings.
