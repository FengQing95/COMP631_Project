Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time in Chicago and we knew we had to have a deep dish. Our friends had suggested to try this place out. We came here about 12PM on a Wednesday and there was completely no wait, which is a plus because from all the reviews we knew the wait can be pretty long. Me & my husband got 2 personal pizzas and it was the perfect amount for us. I got the Lou & he got the Chicago Classic! Both we're good but we both enjoyed the Lou more. We also added sausage to the Lou.
