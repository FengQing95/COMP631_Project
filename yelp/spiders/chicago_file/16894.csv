Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered 3 large pies, which reportedly each serve 4.  The Lou (spinach mix, mushrooms, tomatoes, covered with mozzarella, romano and cheddar cheese) is DELICIOUS and the cheddar cheese blends perfectly with the spinach for a unified pizza experience in each bite.  The Malnati Chicago Classic (sausage, loads of cheese and a chunky tomato sauce) does not hold back on the meat.  This Housemade Chicago sausage covers the entire pizza.  I actually think it was one large pizza size patty!  The third was a build your own pizza ( can't remember the toppings). The crusts on all three was the trademark Buttercrust.  This crust lives up to its name with its buttery goodness.  At first glance I thought a Buttercrust would clash with the savory toppings, but no it's the perfect accompaniment for Lou Malnati's fresh pizza toppings.  The Lou's crust includes garlic which minimizes the sweetness a bit and helps to create the perfect crust for a savory all veggie pizza.  Eat here when you visit .....they have over 25 restaurants. But if you don't wNt to wIt you can order online, I am!
