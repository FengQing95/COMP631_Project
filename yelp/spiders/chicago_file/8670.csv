Art Institute of Chicago////The AI is a great museum especially because many times throughout the year it is free to get in and they also offer great discounts (students $12, Chicago residents get a $2 discount). It's an amazing museum to take friends from out of town or even a place to go with your family. I've been here so many times but there is always something new and amazing to discover.
