Smoque BBQ////I had the half brisket sandwich, a quarter slab of the St. Louis ribs, and baked beans. I love that they give you two kinds of BBQ sauce. The brisket had delicious bark on it though the meat was a tad dry. The ribs were simply heavenly. My friend ordered several sides and they were all yummy; the peach cobbler was great. I would definitely come back if I visit Chicago again.
