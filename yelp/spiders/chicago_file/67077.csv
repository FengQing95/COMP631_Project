Little Goat Diner////I had the Pork Belly with a potato pancake. That dish is simply amazing. I highly recommend you make reservations if you're going to be a table of four or more. We waited for about an hour (we were 5). The good thing is that there is a bar that you may go to while you wait. All in all, a great experience, and the menu is different. Love the diner atmosphere with a twist.
