Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Again, we were advised that the kitchen closed at 10:45P so we needed to make decisions quickly.  We ordered drinks - an Old Overholt Old Fashioned for me and a dirty martini for my friend.  They were expertly crafted but they took forever to arrive.  Once they did though, they were well worth the wait.  In the meantime the waiter delivered homemade sourdough bread with salted butter.  OMG, it was by far the best BUTTER and bread we have ever eaten.  We then followed with the roasted bone marrow.  I know this isn't something for everybody, but it was delicious; spread over more of the toasted sourdough accompanied by a sweet onion jam.  My friend ordered the shortrib stroganoff which she loved and I ordered the steak frites.  To be honest, I thought the steak was way under seasoned, but it was served with a side of seasoning salt.  When I added that to the steak the flavor soared.  The frites were crispy and hot.  And just for good measure, we ordered a side of the bacon...rich, sweet, savory all in one.  I had to take half of it with us, I was truly on fat overload!!!
