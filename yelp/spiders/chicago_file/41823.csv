Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My favorite tapas place! I'm so glad my coworker recommended this place. Portions are generous and the prices are reasonable. I can tell the staff are experienced enough to deal with large crowds - our tapas came out steadily despite the high volume of orders. Definitely try the roasted dates with bacon and apple vinaigrette - it sounds weird, but trust me - it's GOOD. The paella is delicious as well. Try the lobster paella with lobster, bay scallops and yellow squash. It was very savory and enough to fill three people. And don't forget to order a pitcher of sangria! The pitchers are small, but they are enough for two. The white and passion fruit are must-tries.
