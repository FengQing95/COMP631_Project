Art Institute of Chicago////Art Institute is such a great place to go when you just want to take a few hours to get your culture on. Â I totally enjoyed walking through and enjoying some of the best art in the world. I went on the free Thursday night and although it was a lot of people it was very well organized. They even have a well organized coat check. I had the opportunity to see Caravaggio last week and it was amazing. I definitely cant wait to go back!
