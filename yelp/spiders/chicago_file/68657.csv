Little Goat Diner////I LOVE the gourmet diner atmosphere. Great craft beer selection. Best onion rings I've ever had. The beef sandwich I had was killer and rich beyong belief. And their deserts? Pork milkshake? Just try it. Their portions are perfect - depending on what you order you'll likely have leftovers due to the delicious richness of everything they make.
