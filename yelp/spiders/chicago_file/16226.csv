Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place is famous. So when I had the opportunity to try it I was very excited. Didn't mind the wait. I was surprised when it turned out to be deep dish. Then my curiosity was satisfied, and didn't feel like I was missing out, because I get the same at Italian Pie Shoppe. Its not the same Chicago experience. I can live with that and hope I'm not blaspheming too much on my own personal comparison.
