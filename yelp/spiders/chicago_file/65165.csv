Smoque BBQ////A friend and I tried nearly all the meat varieties they have - chopped brisket, sliced brisket, st louis ribs, pulled pork.  Chopped brisket (as close as you could get to burnt ends) and pulled pork were my favorite, and I also liked that they gave you both sweet sauce and vinegary sauce.  We tried many of the sides too: fries (huge portion!), cornbread, mac & cheese, and cole slaw...which is vinegary, not creamy (for those of you who care).
