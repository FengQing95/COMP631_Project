Smoque BBQ////Just visited Smoque for the first time with some dear friends who are in town and I must say----pretty AMAZING.  I love BBQ, but my experiences with really authentic tastes have been limited to Memphis (the rest of my experiences come from places like TGI Fridays...gulp) and that's it.  So it was great to try something new! I had a half slab of babyback ribs (plenty!), the mac & cheese, and the brisket chili.  The barbeque sauce is ON POINT with the ribs--I had to keep dipping them into the side cup because it was just soooo good.  The macaroni was also phenomenal---crusty on the top, gooey on the inside, and VERRRRRRY cheesy.  I didn't like the brisket chili, however...it was a gametime decision and was actually a little odd tasting.  I did, however, steal some of my hubb's fries and they were off the chains good. Be prepared for a no-frills, no-nonsense interior that is PACKED with people.  You order your food first then they find you a seat.  We did have to wait in line a fairly long time, but it was worth it.  Delicious stuff, y'all!
