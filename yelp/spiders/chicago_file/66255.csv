Little Goat Diner////I'd been looking forward to going to Little Goat for quite some time, and was bummed after tonight's meal.  To start, the fried pickles & onions were super greasy. Obviously grease is to be expected with fried anything, but it was excessive.  They ran out of my top dinner choice, so I selected the Korean burger, which was...interesting. Our service was mediocre, and the best part of the meal was my cocktail.
