Little Goat Diner////Having so thoroughly enjoyed our experience at Girl and the Goat, we were thrilled to see Little Goat open across the street. We decided to check it out on a cold Saturday afternoon, which we later discovered was an excellent time to go. Delicious food and a charming atmosphere amounted to a great time at Little Goat.
