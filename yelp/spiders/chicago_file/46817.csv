Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The restaurant itself as well is nice inside.  A little decieving to the eye as far as space from the outside but when you get inside its huge.  Multiple rooms plus a large bar.  Small patio but in all I was drawn to all the rooms and the ambiance.  I went at night and it was sort of a romantic dimness to the place but its lively at the same time.
