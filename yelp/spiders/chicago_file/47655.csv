Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Lively, upbeat atmosphere. Service was okay as was the food. A friend and I tried about 8 items off the menu plus dessert. I sent the meatballs back because they did not taste as described on the menu. Everything else was fine. A good place to go with friends so you can try each other's menu choices.
