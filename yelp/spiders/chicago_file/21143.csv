Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////A few years ago I had a procedure done that limits the amount of food I can take in and these days I choose a low carbohydrate diet which is rich in protein.  Lou's has me covered there, too.  They offer a "crust-less" pizza that features the big sausage patty, cheese and tomatoes and it's also a butter crust pie.  It really succeeds at conveying that butter crust quality.  The only thing missing is the crunch.  I just love it.
