Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Stuffed spinach bread is honestly the only reason why I come here. That and the bartender Chris who makes a damn good Moscow Mule. Family friendly chain establishment. Not a fan of the pizza so much as there are other favorites I prefer over Lou's. Nevertheless worth a try if you visit Chicago.
