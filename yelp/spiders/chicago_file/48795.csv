Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My boyfriend had the roasted dates wrapped in bacon with apple vinaigrette and he said it was so good that I tried a tiny bite (I'm pescetarian). Sure enough, it was absolutely delicious. The flavors worked perfectly together. Next, we had the pintxos platter with the short-rib stuffed piquillo pepper, bacon-wrapped grilled shrimp, chorizo-wrapped medjool date and cheese, goat cheese croquette with lemon gastrique, roasted beet crostini with herbed goat cheese and hazelnuts, deviled egg with bacon and mustard. The goat cheese croquette was my absolute favorite with the shrimp in a close second. Next, I had the market greens salad, with chili-roasted corn, tomato, cucumber, avocado, goat cheese, and fresno chili vinaigrette; grilled squid on arugula with olive oil and garlic. It was fairly straightforward, but truly excellent. The salad was a great break from some of the other heavier tapas I ate tonight. We also ordered the spicy potatoes with tomato aioli, which were simply divine. I was skeptical when I first read the description on the menu, but boy, was I wowed!
