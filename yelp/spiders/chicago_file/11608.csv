Art Institute of Chicago////Very good museum with an interesting array of exhibits covering nearly all periods and world geographies. I was particularly impressed with the Impressionist exhibits as I was not expecting to see so many Monet's, Manet's and Renoir's which rivaled the Met and the Louvre.
