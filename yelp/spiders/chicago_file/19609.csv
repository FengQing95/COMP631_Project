Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Then came the pizza- my friend and I ordered a medium Lou and a medium Malnati Chicago classic. Fantastic pizza choices, terrible size choices. We severely underestimated the size of these things. They were so thick that we barely finished half of each one. The pizza was out of this world though- buttery thick deliciousness- full flavored sausage and the sauce was to die for.
