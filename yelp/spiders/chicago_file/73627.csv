Little Goat Diner////Dining in the West Loop feels a lot like going to a theme park. Your first ride is dodging other cars and pedestrians in an almost endless search for parking. Then you walk through what looks like street after street of abandoned warehouses and it feels like a murderer could jump in front of you at any second, but in reality all you'll see are yuppies, hipsters and college kids. Finally, you get to restaurant row and get to stand in line for 2 hours while you wait for your turn (to eat).
