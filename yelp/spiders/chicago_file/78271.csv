Little Goat Diner////Pork belly paradise!! Pork belly is my favorite so I HAD to come here. This place is a chic diner that takes your classic brunch & lunch foods and puts a unique twist on them! I'm always on the hunt for fusion restaurants and this place made the top of my list! The portions are massive. Flavors are so bold and tasty. Simply phenomenal. Chef Stephanie Izard is an amazing chef, and I've become a huge fan. I cannot wait to check out the sister restaurants next - Girl & the Goat and Duck, Duck, Goat.
