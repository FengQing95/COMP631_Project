Little Goat Diner////Went to Little goat on a Sunday afternoon to get some food. I shared a sandwich (Los Drowned) and the fried pickles and onions appetizer. We also shared the Mac N Cheese. Overall the food was really good, the sandwich was top notch and would recommend it. The Fried Pickles and onion rings were also really good. For the price I thought they were worth it. The Mac N Cheese was the only item I probably wouldn't get again. I just didn't feel like there was anything special with it.
