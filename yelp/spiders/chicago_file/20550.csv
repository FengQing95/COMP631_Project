Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If this review was for Texas I would give it a 5 star.  Lou Malnati's pizza is one of the best pizza's in Chicago.  The deep dish pizza is not oily, has a crisp bottom crust and the sauce is perfect.  The choice of Mozzarella cheese is terrific and the sausage is blended with just the right amount of fennel seed, not over bearing with just the right amount of seasoning.  The pizzeria makes some intelligent choices like allowing you to order while you wait for a table.  As everyone knows, a good pie takes about 40 min to make, so enjoy.  Chicago has some really good competition.
