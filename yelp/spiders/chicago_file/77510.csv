Little Goat Diner////We started with the goat chili cheese fries and boy, they were RICH. Perfectly crispy fries, drenched in a creamy cheese sauce with chunks of goat hiding under every fry. Beans, tomatoes, and chickpeas complete the goat chili topping to these fries. Absolutely order these - but prepare to be full before your entree arrives.
