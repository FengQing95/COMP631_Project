Smoque BBQ////Awesome BBQ. The best beef brisket I have ever tasted. It was so soft and juicy. It literally melts in your mouth. It is nothing like the tough chewy brisket you find elsewhere. The family had chicken and pulled pork And loved them too. Sides were also great. Place was crowded on a late Saturday afternoon but tables opened up pretty quickly. It is worth a trip to try this place.
