Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I always enjoy my experience here.  The food is incredible and there are so many choices for different dietary restrictions and tastes.  The initial bread and olive oil at the table is super fresh and a great starter.  My favorites are the spicy potatoes braves and the tomato goat cheese.  The empanadas are also wonderful.  We all enjoyed the dessert with the yelp check in.  I had the truffle chocolate cake.  It was super rich and flavorful.  If you're a fan of chocolate, this is the dessert for you!
