Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place had neither good food nor good service! I wanted to show my girls how good deep dish pizza was but this was a huge disappointment.  Pizza took forever, we were there for around 3 hrs.  The "place your order while your are waiting for a table" is BS.  We still wAited an hour after we sat down.  Pizza was burned, cheese was congealed, all the toppings fell off.  Don't believe the ratings, this place is terrible.  Don't waste your time!
