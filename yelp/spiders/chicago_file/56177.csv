Smoque BBQ////The sides were a mix of success & failure. My friend had the slaw on his platter-- only average.  I had decent cornbread, but I'll never understand why Chicago bbq places serve their sides in little tin foil muffin cups. Who created this rule?  The mac & cheese is a definite winner - and it's got a lot more flavor & depth than the typical elbow mac with Rico's cheese sauce.. I tasted at least a couple cheeses and the crust was excellent.
