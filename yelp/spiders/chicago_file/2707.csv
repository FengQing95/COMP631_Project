The Purple Pig////With a name like Purple Pig you know the meats are gonna be good here but honestly, what I walked away craving were the veggie dishes. Come to think of it, I don't think my friend and I got anything meat based the whole time we were there and I wasn't sad about it. I didn't even realize it until just now!
