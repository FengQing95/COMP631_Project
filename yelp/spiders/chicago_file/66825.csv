Little Goat Diner////I tend to order like a food critic, always looking for things that sound like they are going to fall flat due to the chef overreaching and sometimes I'm right nad they suck but at other times they turn out to be heavenly. For all of the craziness happening on my plate it somehow all wen together perfectly and I was very happy with my experience.
