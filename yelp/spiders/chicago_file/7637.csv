Art Institute of Chicago////I just love this place! My boyfriend has a membership, so I have been able to go a lot lately. The place is well organized and people working are always willing to point you in the right direction. I really enjoy going to the special exhibits too! It is nice that they are always changing. Looking forward to my next visit!
