Art Institute of Chicago////Such a well run museum. Definitely visit the Vincent Van Gogh bedroom exhibit.  So there are three paintings of the bedroom, one that lives in Chicago and the other two overseas.  They are all together side by side to see differences in the three as they were painted at different times. Great way to learn and appreciate Van Gogh art. I put this museum as a must see if you are in Chicago.
