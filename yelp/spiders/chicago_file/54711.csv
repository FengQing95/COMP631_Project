Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We came around 10:30 and they were serving both brunch and lunch. Our favorites were the Citrus French Toast with Goat Cheese, Spicy Potato with Tomato Aioli, and Buttermilk Fried Chicken with Piri-piri Sauce. The potatoes had a kick (not spicy) and the aioli captured tang and creaminess. The fried chicken wasn't very crispy but was delicious with the cool, also tangy sauce. And spreading goat cheese on french toast--genius! Wasn't a huge fan of the lamb kebabs because it was saltier and drier than I expected.
