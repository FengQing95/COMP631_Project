The Purple Pig////Service: The service was pretty disappointing overall. We had a total of THREE servers during our whole meal, none of which were attentive. I was annoyed that we were duped into ordering fancy San pellegrino water when our waiter asked if we wanted "sparkling or tonic water"? I was disappointed to see that inflated price on our bill when it arrived. We were able to order our dishes sporadically, which was great, but we didn't see our servers for huge hunks of time.
