Smoque BBQ////Now, being my first visit, I only tried a couple things. I ordered the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich with pulled pork and sliced brisket (in case you're wondering, it's a whole sandwich bun sliced in half; each half contains your choice of meat). I chose the fries as my side item and, might I add, they were some of the best hand-cut fries I've eaten. And no, I'm not exaggerating. The pulled pork ROCKED! It was very lean and flavorful and had a nice crust. The brisket was really good, but just a tad fatty for my taste. Sauce was tangy and a bit on the thin side (not a criticism, just a fact). I happen to love the 'slaw here. It's not the traditional creamy version, but has more of a vinaigrette dressing. I'm already planning my next visit, once this awful heartburn subsides...it's not because of the food being too something...except fricken' delicious which caused me to scarf it down way too fast thereby producing this painful side effect. Chew slowly please, if you can :)
