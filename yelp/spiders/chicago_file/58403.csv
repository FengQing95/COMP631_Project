Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been to Northeast Spain before and wanted to re-experience the magic of pintxos that this restaurant was offering. Unfortunately pintxo selection was small and mostly not served on the classic sliced baguette, but still delicious nonetheless. The bacalao fritter was as delectable and creamy as they had it in the Basque region ! My friend and I shared a whole pitcher of the blackberry sangria (highly recommend for a hot summer evening) as well as one serving of the mixed meats paella which was more than enough for two people.
