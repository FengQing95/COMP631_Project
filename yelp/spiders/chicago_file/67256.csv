Little Goat Diner////I can actually taste and feel the crunch of the onions when I bite through the batter which is definitely a plus. However there was a long strand of hair that was fried along with the batch but our waitress was extremely helpful and had the kitchen whip up a new batch immediately. The fried pickles was sour enough to cut through all the fat from the deep fryer which I really liked.
