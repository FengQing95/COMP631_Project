Smoque BBQ////I recently used Smoque to cater a family party in Fathers Day.  I was absolutely impressed.  I have used various catering services often for both work and family and My experience with Smoque was one of the easiest and best.  I called to make the order and the head of catering was very friendly and efficient.  My pick up time was available and she included plates, napkins, and serving supplies. On pick up day, catering orders do not need to wait in the long regular line, you just go to the front and tell them you have catering, which I appreciated.  There was a two minute wait and I was offered a free drink!  Nice!!  Then, a lady brought out boxes , double checked everything was there (THANK YOU!!) and even loaded boxes into my car.  Everyone loved the brisket, pulled pork, beans, and Mac.  The salad was pretty bland and boring so I'd skip that next time.  Everything else was amazing and well priced.  We will def use again.
