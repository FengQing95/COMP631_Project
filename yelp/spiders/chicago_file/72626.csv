Little Goat Diner////I really wanted to like this place, but was not so satisfied. We ordered the chili cheese fries, which were excellent! But the little piggy went to china was just salty! I couldn't eat the whole thing. I read some other reviews here, complaining the food was salty. Maybe the management takes notice, and does something about it. I really liked the over all ambiance, and interesting variety in their menu. I would give this place another chance, after I get that salty taste still lingering off.
