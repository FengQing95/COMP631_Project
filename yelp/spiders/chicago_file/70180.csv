Little Goat Diner////I ordered what's called "Bull's Eye French Toast" - which is basically "egg in a basket" only with bomb ass sweet onion brioche with an egg cooked in it. Served with it is fried chicken and bbq maple syrup and gooseberries. So it's basically a combination of chicken & waffles, french toast, and egg in a basket - all of which are totally lovely things. So I had some reasonably high expectations.
