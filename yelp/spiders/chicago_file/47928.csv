Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The only thing I'd say that was a little annoying was the noise level. Sure, it's loud, and that's to be expected. However, their PA system used to call out reservations is a little obnoxious. It's not only too loud, but it also hits at a frequency that seems to pierce right through to your brain. So every time a table is called out, you get a mini headache. I'd suggest to them maybe taking cellphone numbers down, like a lot of restaurants are starting to do nowadays.
