Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of the first....if not THE first...pioneers of the Tapas movement when it opened in the early 90s. And while many such places have come and gone since then, Ba-Ba endures. Always packed and bustling....huge colorful fun place....bring a large group and sample a ton of things. Food is quite good......not spectacular.....but many things are really delicious (the beef with horseradish is my fave......shrimp dishes are good too) Sure there are many restaurants that may have lapped Â them in terms of authenticity, etc.....but it's a great escape on a cold Chicago night in a cute vibrant neighborhood. Will always have a soft spot for it.
