Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were recommended to this place by some locals and it did not disappoint! Wow. So glad to have experienced true deep dish pizza. We ordered ahead and picked up and are down on the river walk which was a superb experience. The line on a Sunday night at 8 was 1.5 hours (if we hadn't ordered ahead), plus 45 min to make the pizza, so plan ahead!
