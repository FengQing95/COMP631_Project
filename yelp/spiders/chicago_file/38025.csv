Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Such an awesome meal. The red sauce that comes with the baked goat cheese is mind blowing. Pro tip: use the sourdough with the goat cheese over the Texas toast. I like Texas toast but as you know now the sourdough is where it's at. The wedge salad is huge and you can easily split between two people (we had some leftover). The bacon is thick sliced and is simple with a little salt and pepper but will blow your mind. The 22 oz. ribeye between us was honestly such a good suggestion by our waiter. We were each going to go with little filets, but he suggested the 22 oz. ribeye as their prime/popular cut of meat so I did not argue with the man. It was cooked perfectly and the steak salt on the side is clutch. Wild mushrooms were amazing and flavorful and the frites were obviously great.
