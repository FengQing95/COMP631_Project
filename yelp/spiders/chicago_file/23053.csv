Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We looked up a couple spots, but this standard and in a central location. There was a wait, but you can order your pizza ahead of time, which is awesome! They got it down to science. A bunch of the pizzas looked pretty good but we stuck with their special--gotta go with the classic to set expectations. So I ordered ahead of time, and they said they'd get a head start but it'd still be 10-15 after we're seated for the pizza to be ready. I thought that was reasonable and great that they did that.
