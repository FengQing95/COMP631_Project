Little Goat Diner////The food is great for breakfast, a cute coffee shop next door to bide your time in while you wait. Parking can be a pain but does not effect my review. I wish they a bit more savory choices but I would recommend the bullseye French toast. There is communal seating as well so be sure to specify you preference.
