Little Goat Diner////Just discovered that Little Goat has a vegan menu - the selection is limited and you have to ask your server for it special, but the options are delicious! So glad that restaurants are starting to understand that they are missing out sales by excluding vegan eaters. Â I'll definitely be back soon Little Goat!
