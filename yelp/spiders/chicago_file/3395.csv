The Purple Pig////We did not have to wait very long on a Saturday night and we got seated at the outdoor covered communal table which had an interesting view of the city and restaurant itself.  We ordered only three dishes due to filling half of our appetite at the previous restaurant.  The highlight of the nights food was definitely the fried pig ears with egg (as pictured).  The pasta was also delicious but obviously on the salty side from what I remember, not sure if they purposely made it this salty or not.  And lastly were these blue chips with some kind of crab cake on them, it was just okay.  Overall the meal was good though and I'm sure if we had time to try even more of the dishes or have a full dinner here we would be pleasantly surprised at the quality and creativity of the food.  Just look at the pictures, the menu offered here is nothing short of amazing.
