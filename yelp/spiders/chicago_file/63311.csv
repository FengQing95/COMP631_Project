Smoque BBQ////Ranked one of the top restaurants in Chicago it was long over due that I have never been here . I have only had this type off BBQ in stl and I loved it! Driving down Pulaski you might miss it there's no sign or anything that sticks out. I got the sliced beef brisket with a portion of pulled pork. The beef was good tender. Although my favorite was the pulled pork it had a lot more flavor. Mac and cheese was standard. The beans were ok they had a strong smoky flavor that was overboard to me. But I loved how the coleslaw was fresh and crunchy and not soggy like many places. Finish all that with a sweet peach cobbler and it's a wrap! Really homey food that will put you to sleep after. Unfortunately I have to end this by saying stl BBQ is much better ( pappys, sugarfire) that's hard to say being born and raised here my whole life and cubs fan lol but my stomach doesn't lie. Overall a must try!! Ps wish they had more sauces!
