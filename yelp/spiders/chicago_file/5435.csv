The Purple Pig////The food is tapas style and I split three dishes with my sister and it was more than enough for the both of us, I was struggling to finish my half of the last dish. We ordered the cornbread, grilled octopus, and pork shoulder. We started off with the cornbread and it was alright but nothing special. The octopus and pork shoulder however tasted amazing! The pork shoulder was my favorite dish and is a must get. Very filling and great flavors! I would recommend both of those dishes if you ever stop here.
