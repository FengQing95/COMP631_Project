Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Before you order the pizza they always warn you that it'll take around 40 minutes for a pizza. Even though the wait for the pizza was long, every single minute was worth it. The cheese and the flavor was just on point! My favorite part was the crust(me being a crust guy!). The bread was not burnt neither undercooked. It was just crunchy and chewy at the same time. I would recommend this place to tourists who are visiting chicago that wants to taste the classic thick deep dish pizza from Chicago!
