Little Goat Diner////I had a really hard time finding just one thing that sounded good on the menu, so I took a recommendation from a friend and had the scallion pancake with pork belly and bok choy. I'd give it a 7 out of 10. I felt there was too much bok choy on top and not enough pork belly. The pancake was excellent though! I was torn between brussel sprouts with almonds and roasted root veggies as my side (everything is served ala carte) and the server recommended the sprouts. Good.. yes, but I think I might have enjoyed the root veggies a little more. I felt most of the flavor from the sprouts came from the salt I added to them, not from the sprouts themselves.
