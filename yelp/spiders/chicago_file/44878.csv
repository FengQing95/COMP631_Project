Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Any who, We asked for a table and the wait was 1 hour, okay fine, so we sat and waited in the walkway with two benches that leads into the restaurant. We both thought the hostesses was rude but I ignored her and sat patiently. Â My friend realized that you had to be inside the restaurant to hear them call your name. So why isn't there speakers in the waiting hall so when they call your name you can hear instead of blocking the entrance?
