Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I always come in for lunch, usually slightly before or after peak times and have never had to wait for a table. Their lunch special of a personal sized cheese, sausage or pepperoni pizza and a small salad is a very nice deal and you will leave full! Service has always been good too.
