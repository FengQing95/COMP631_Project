Art Institute of Chicago////We only spent about and hour and 1/2 but we saw many of the big pieces this museum has to offer, including Picasso, Monet, Dali, Magritte, Matisse, Wood, Hopper, Van Gogh, O'Keefe and so many others. It also has a distracting hallway of middle eastern and east asian religious sculptures, a stained glass exhibit and an antique furniture exhibit - would have peeped the furniture longer if I had more time to spend.
