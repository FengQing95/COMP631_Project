Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I have been to Babette's a few times.! Service, food, and cocktails have always been excellent.  I particularly enjoy the service here.  But I am very disappointed with my recent visit. I was there for my birthday again a few weeks ago.  We had our usual including oysters,  elote style corn, crab cake.  I had the steak frites and my husband ordered the fish special.  Everything was great until 30 minutes after we left.  My husband had food poisoning and was sick for the entire evening and the day after.  Painful experience.
