Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My wife and I went on a date night. It was AMAZING! The food was delicious. We had a Wet ribeye 22 oz ( shared) side of Goat cheese, Pommes Frites, Brussel Sprouts. My wife is hard to impress with food and she couldn't stop talking about it. Definitely plan to spend a little money, it is well worth it. Â Our waiter was amazing! I dont remember his name but we gave a great tip. Everyone we encountered was amazing also! We will definitely return one a special day!
