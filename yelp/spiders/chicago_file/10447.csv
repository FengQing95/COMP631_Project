Art Institute of Chicago////Went here on a Friday afternoon and it was fantastic. I have a soft spot for Claude Monet and being able to see my favorite paintings by him was amazing. I also like how they have a wide variety of exhibits in this museum. Something for everyone is always a plus. I only wish I had more time to go through everything! I will be back to see the things we missed such as the Native American section.
