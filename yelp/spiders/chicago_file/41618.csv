Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We went here for the first time last night with one other couple. The place is huge and was certainly bustling. We were seated right away at our reservation time. The place appears dirty or maybe just outdated. We ordered the passion fruit sangria which was delicious. Chorizo wrapped dates, blue cheese steak and scallops where amazing tapas. The rest were very mediocre. Our service was absolutely terrible. The waiter never came to our table, and when he did, it was because we had to wave him over from his "perch" near the kitchen. We would've ordered more food and drinks if he came back....but we got sick of waiting for him and decided to get our bill and leave. All the other waitstaff seemed to be great and attentive, we just got a dud.
