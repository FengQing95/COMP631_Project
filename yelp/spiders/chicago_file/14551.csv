Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place is not as popular as Giordano's because it has less advertising and less tourist attraction factor going for them, but who cares! This pizza place delivers a quality product. The cheese and tomato sauce was not overdone and the toppings were a sufficent amount. The customer service was better than Giordanos too. I will surely be back.
