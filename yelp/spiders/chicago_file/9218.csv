Art Institute of Chicago////It's definitely a top-notch museum considering its size, scope and collection. Â There are quite a number of classic pieces here that hundreds of people have already mentioned. There's a lot of great stuff, but there's also a lot of stuff that I don't really dig at all, such as some of the impressionism, the old American colonial-type stuff, and some of the ridiculous modern works.
