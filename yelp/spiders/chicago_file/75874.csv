Little Goat Diner////It's difficult to choose your meal as everything sounds delicious and in an incarnation you're familiar with but better.  So you've had French toast but bit garlic brioche French toast!  I ordered that with crispy chicken and strawberries.  My friends ordered a juicy cheeseburger and the tastiest fries I've had in a while.  We also ordered fried pickles.  Way to indulge!
