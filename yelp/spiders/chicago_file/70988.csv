Little Goat Diner////Little Goat rocks; after you get past the hostess (w/ long straight hair).  She is a little edgy.  After that, things were magical. Our waitress, Megan, was a delight. The menu has a wonderful variety to select from. We went for breakfast. My wife had blueberry pancakes which were delicious. Her over easy egg was cooked to perfection. I enjoyed the cheesy hash browns and scrambled eggs. I was offered chipotle sauce and habanero sauce for my eggs , both were fabulous. The diner itself is very well lit, and inviting. There is a central communal table , booths of various sizes, and bar stools. Don't miss Little Goat Diner.
