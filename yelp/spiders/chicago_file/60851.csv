Smoque BBQ////The family traveled up to the restaurant at about 11:30am on a Friday afternoon and after hearing all of the reviews we wanted some BBQ. At about the time we ordered and were seated by the host the lunch crowd started lining up. Tables can get tight not too mention sparse when groups start piling in to the restaurant. The restaurant was clean and kept clean by the host/bus boy. He had the job of cleaning off tables and seating customers.
