Smoque BBQ////Went back to Smoque for a late lunch, with a girlfriend after hours of garage sale shopping. The line for service was out the door and onto the sidewalk! So - we called our order in - waited comfortably in the shade on a bench in a little park 1/2 block away, then strolled back to pick up our brisket sandwich order. Walked back to the park, and enjoyed our meal al fresco! (This was definatly the way to go!)
