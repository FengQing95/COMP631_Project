Little Goat Diner////If you're going out to eat, especially with friends, family, or partners, it's important that you can hear your conversations. The music here is a good level; you can hear it, but it doesn't impede conversations. It's tasteful and in tune with the vibe of the diner. The place is well-decorated and gives a good feeling of openness. It's good for going out with the girls or the guys, but also with family
