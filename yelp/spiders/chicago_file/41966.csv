Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I prefer iberico, but maybe only because i've been there more....but also, just like you cannot compare a steak from David Burkes to one at the Golden nugget; you cannot compare chain-style tapas at babareba to home cooking from iberico. Â Five stars because of decoration and liveliness!
