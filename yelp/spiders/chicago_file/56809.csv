Smoque BBQ////I ordered a tray of bread pudding for a BBQ I was having. I was in traffic for 2 hours driving to Smoque to pick it up and 1 hour driving back home. A total of 3 hours commuting .. And I will say, the bread pudding was worth the trip. Definitely will be ordering again in the future. While I was there, I tried the Mac n cheese and peach cobbler. Both were great. Will be back sometime for lunch to try a meal.
