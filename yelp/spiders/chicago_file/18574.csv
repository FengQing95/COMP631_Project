Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Love this pizzeria! We go to the one in Oak Park and the pizza is always great. Love the crispy crust. I also love their chop salad for an alternative to a pizza. The decor is great, contemporary rustic, along with great service. They have a large sliding glass wall curb side that opens up in the summer time for Â great dining al fresco style.
