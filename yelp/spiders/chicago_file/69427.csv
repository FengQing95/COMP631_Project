Little Goat Diner////Being that I was only a table of one, I was happy to sit at the counter. The hostess took to me the end of the counter, where it was busier than Grand Central Station, with the entrance to the kitchen, wait staff, etc....I asked to be seated on the other end of the counter where there were two available stools.
