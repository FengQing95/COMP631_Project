Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Be smart and make reservations way ahead of time. But, if you are patient, you can pretty much enjoy Bavette's whenever you want. And you really should. Even if it's for late night drinks and a slice of pie. This is my favorite steak house in Chicago, but it's a lot of people's favorite, so plan accordingly.
