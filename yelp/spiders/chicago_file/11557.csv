Art Institute of Chicago////I knew nothing of what to expect beforehand. This was my first visit to the Art Institute. And it left a great impression! The Chagall windows were a pleasant surprise, the contemprary and modern art was fun and engaging, the classical Euorpean art was gorgeous! I could have easily spent another hour or two there, exploring all the rooms and levels! The museum seems to go on forever, with room after room and wing after wing. I hope to have the chance to revisit again!
