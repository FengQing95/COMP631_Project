Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered a large deep dish "Lou" pizza for three people as two of us were vegetarians. First glances, pretty good! It looked like a good Deep Dish pizza. Taste wise, it was average. I would have liked to have more toppings. My friend observed that the amount of mushrooms and spinach was reduced. We aren't sure if that's a one-off thing.
