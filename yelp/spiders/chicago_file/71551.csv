Little Goat Diner////Went there on a recommendation. The moment we walked in we exclaimed , " this looks like an upscale, foodie diner!" And that's exactly what it was. Inventive and delicious takes on classic diner fare and honestly one of the best restaurants I've been to in months. We started with brown butter pumpkin and butternut squash soup that was one of those dishes you just have to sigh and smile when you eat it. The goat chili was outstanding too. Everyone loved their dishes, cornbeef hash, butternut squash and fennel salad, and an inventive burger. Dessert is a must, with all their creative pies, shakes, and sundaes. We got the pumpkin Carmel corn shake, should have order two ! Always a long wait, but the great thing is you can put you name in and they text you when table is almost ready. Check out one of the great bars in the area while you wait!
