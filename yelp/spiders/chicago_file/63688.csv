Smoque BBQ////We got a gift card to smoque and my husband and I were not disappointed! Our food came out right away and the BBQ flavor was great! I think it's a kind of expensive place when you start to add up the sides but Smoque is worth checking out for the quality of the meat you get! The vibe is country/western to be expected and they have TV's to watch a game too if you'd like! I would recommend this place and try as many of the sauces at your table as you can.
