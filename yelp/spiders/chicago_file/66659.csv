Little Goat Diner////My partner ordered pancakes that as he put it, were "meh" - also not worth the price for the average quality. Pancakes are a staple of any attempt at being a diner and is something you need to get right! Our friend had the prathas breakfast burrito. It was served open faced??? with the eggs underneath and piles of toppings on top. It looked more like a salad and was difficult to eat. A scone we shared was the best part of our meal but the heavy use of fennel seed made it uncomfortable to eat. We are honestly dumbfounded by the glowing reviews as this is clearly a place heavy on style and LOW on substance. Yes, the place was beautifully decorated inside and the server was attentive but overall I go to a dining spot for the food and judge it based upon overall quality versus the price. Simply charging more and adding a twist to every dish does not make any place worth more. We tipped very well knowing we will not be back. Our server was great and we don't hold her accountable for the decisions of the owner and chefs.
