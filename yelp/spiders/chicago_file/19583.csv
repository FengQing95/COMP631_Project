Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For me, Lou Malnati's came in a very close second place, just behind Giordano's. The deep dish pizza here is definitely very different from the other 3 places. The slices are smaller, and the crust is thinner (so take note that you should probably order more than you normally would at the other deep dish places). It also seems like, instead of overwhelming you with an enormous, thick slice of pizza, Lou's takes a more refined approach. And boy did it work. The flavors were perfect, and the butter crust was delicious (not an easy feat - most of the other butter crusts I had on this trip were thick, dry, and just plain excessive).
