Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I understand that patience is a virtue, but the experience I had ordering from here was ridiculous! I was on the phone for almost 20 minutes trying to use my gift card which I've used here before, and I gave it to the woman on the phone Â and she messed it up and kept saying the card was invalid and kept messing it up again and again and kept saying it was invalid 5 times before they went and got a manager. Then the phone was hung up before I can even confirm that my order was being delivered. I suggest you order from another location.
