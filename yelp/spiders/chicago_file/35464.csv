Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Came here with 3 others on a Sunday night. The place is decorated so neat you feel like you're in an old mansion. We were downstairs which was very dark but cool ambience. The food was amazing and having 4 of us we were able to try a lot. We will definitely be back for more delicious food and wine! The waitstaff was very helpful with wine choices and menu choices.
