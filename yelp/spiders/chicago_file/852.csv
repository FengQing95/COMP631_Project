Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Wild Berry Cafe is a great breakfast place.  It's bright and upbeat. The food is delicious and Allison out waitress was very nice.  The quantity is good especially the omelette because it comes with pancakes and fruit or hash browns.  Try not to over order. It's easy to do because everything seems tempting.
