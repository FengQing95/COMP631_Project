Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Did not make a reservation.  The wait was long (1.5 hours).  But be sure to ask for the "free wine daily" that they have posted on the wall to get a free glass of wine.  The food itself was not worth the wait.  typical steakhouse quality, which means good.  but nothing spectacular.  I had the Chicago Cut steak, and my wife had the Short-rib Stroganoff.  The Stroganoff noodles were a bit undercooked, but still edible.  The stuffed potato however was good.  Overall, I would say decent/good quality....but not worth the wait or the $$$.
