Smoque BBQ////People need to lay off the Yelp juice.  I think that some Yelpers may feel compelled to rank places highly because their fellow community members have done so.  The Smoke Daddy's ribs seem better to me, but there may be some place even better than both.  I'm going to continue plugging away on my hunt for great barbeque here in Chicago.
