Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////THIS IS MY FAVORITE TAPAS BAR. Incredible small plates. Bacon wrapped dates? Why, yes please and thank you. Other worldly seasoned potatoes with spicy aioli? Don't mind if I do. Brussels sprout manchego salad?? SIGN ME UP. And you don't have to stop there. Delicious sangria that will really gave you *feeling* the summer air around you. Never been to a place where the red and white sangria were BOTH good. Service is always kind, excited and ready to help you navigate through any//all the choices on the menu to be sure you have the meal you deserve. If I were on death row, I would make Cafe Ba Ba my last meal.
