The Purple Pig////The Purple Pig is always busy and with good reason.  The drinks are tasty, the servers are knowledgeable, the atmosphere is lively, and the food is crafted with care; even if it's heavy on the salt and sugar for my palate. You'll want to come with a small group as the menu is designed to be shared.
