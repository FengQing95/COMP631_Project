Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I was really sad that we didn't get the paella. I was super looking forward to it but it was priced per serving and they required a minimum of 2 servings per table and me and the boo just wouldn't have been able to finish it. But definitely coming back with a larger group to try it!
