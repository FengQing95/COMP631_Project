Little Goat Diner////To be honest, the food was good but I didn't feel that it was anything particularly special.  I had the Croque Monster which is basically just a ham and cheese omelet with a few pieces of crouton on top.  My friend had the standard eggs but said the biscuit was very good.  My dad had the Asian breakfast which is as concoction of kimchi, eggs, and other delightful things.  They definitely get a plus for creativity but I can't say that the tasted wowed me.
