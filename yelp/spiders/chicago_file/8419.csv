Art Institute of Chicago////NIghthawks.  Now that's real art.  Loneliness and solitude in a nondescript diner in anytown usa.   Could be Argo tea, Starbucks, Denny's, anywhere.   And they don't even have wifi.   Quite a scene of desperation.  Hopefully they at least have some gluten free options so nobody gets sluggish.  And what's with the sinister character in the back.  Hope you brought your pepper spray.
