Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We went here for a birthday, and in general, I thought the tapas were very plain.  Nothing was particularly good/bad, except for the skirt steak (delicious), seared scallops (good but too small) and the paellas (not too good).  The chicken paella and the paella valenciana probably both should have been skipped.  The shrimp and clam fideua was better, the valencian noodles being the highlight.
