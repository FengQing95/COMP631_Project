Art Institute of Chicago////The Magritte exhibit was a real trip. I find Magritte fascinating, and he's always been one of those artists I look for in modern art museums. Even so, I had only a passing familiarity with his work--you know, pipe, apple, etc. This exhibit took us through his whole career, and it was cool to see his favorite motifs come up over and over again in eerier and eerier ways. Bowler hats, boobies, birdcages galore. The famous painting "The Treachery of Images" was in attendance, on vacation from LACMA where I saw it last. I wondered why "The Son of Man" couldn't make it and found (on Wikipedia) that it's in a private collection. Some extraordinarily rich person has it in his living room.
