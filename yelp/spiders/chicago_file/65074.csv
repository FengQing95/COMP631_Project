Smoque BBQ////Within 10 minutes or so our meal was ready and it didn't disappoint. The half rack of ribs had 6 ribs that fell clean off the bone, the mark of a perfect rib.

Delicious potatoey goodness! The brisket sandwich was great too! The meat was smoky and tender and had a perfect char to it on the outside. If I had no self restraint I could have eaten ribs and a brisket sandwich. And finally, the mac & cheese was the perfect way to top this meal. I'm a sucker for cheese and carbs so...
