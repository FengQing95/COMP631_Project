Art Institute of Chicago////There are so many beautiful pieces, I'm so happy that I went. We arrived early and waited in a short line. Around the time the doors opened, the line grew exponentially. We didn't buy the pre-tickets, they cost a tiny bit more, so we went without. We usually fast pass everything, but because we arrived early, it was not needed.
