Little Goat Diner////Food was good. Ambiance ok. We sat outside bc it was SO loud inside that having a conversation would have been impossible. I got the salmon special. Very good. My boyfriend got the sweet and sour pork chops. He liked them. Not my favorite. Overall, the food was good, but not fantastic. I was sad that for a place that was on a popular street with a lot of other options for dining, this restaurant didn't have a lot of beer selections or, in my opinion, enough food selections. The girl and the goat across the street (& same owners) may be a better bet. For the price you may be better off there.
