Little Goat Diner////I've got the same complaints about Little Goat as I do Girl and the Goat, only distilled into a trendy casual diner setting. Namely, Stephanie Izard's growing empire relies way too heavily on salt as a flavor instead of flavor as a flavor. Further, service is very spotty. And if you've ever loved spending $8 on bread, boy, do I have the place for you.
