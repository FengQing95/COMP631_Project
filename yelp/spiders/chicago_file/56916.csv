Smoque BBQ////After one bite of the meat, I knew I was going to give it at least four. After all the remaining bites, I knew why the sides were the size they were. I was pleasantly full. The coleslaw, after a few bites of the rich bbq sauce was a pleasant palate cleaner, preparing you for the next bite of perfectly smoked meat.
