Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Worst experience - not worth the almost 2 hour wait! Way over hyped...so I go in to put my name down the host tells me what's your number we'll text you when your table is ready. It's about an hour 15 minimum wiat. I come back an hour 10 min with no text yet ask what the status of my wait is....the host says just check the link on your phone it's an hour 45 minimum wiat you still got another 30 to wait. So unbelievable and ridiculous the lack of actual customer service!
