Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////In spite of all the hype for Chicago deep dish, I was thoroughly unimpressed. We had to wait half-an-hour for the pizza, and the beer selection was very limited (any self-respectable pizza joint will have an awesome beer selection). It gets three stars, since the seating for large groups is great, the food was adequately filling and the company was good (albeit this is not something the joint can manipulate directly).
