Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I really hate to give this place a negative review because ever since I moved to Chicago ba ba reeba has been my go to for closest to authentic Spanish tapas, but today that all changed. The patatas bravas Â were overly cooked, almost burnt and were cut too big. I almost stopped ordering tapas after that because I felt if you mess up the potatoes, the rest can also go downhill.
