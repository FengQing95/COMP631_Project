Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Don't let the 4k+ reviews fool you. We ordered the chicken wings and salad to start. The salad was fine but the wings were salty. After waiting the 30min it takes to make the deep dish, it arrived room temperature. We ordered the small and we could've done fine with the personal. It was bland ... not sure what the hype is. Our server was very friendly and nice, Sara G.
