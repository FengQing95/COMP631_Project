Little Goat Diner////Honestly I wanted to love Little Goat, I wanted it so hard.  I wanted it as hard as I want those Juicy Pear Jelly Bellies when I open a bag of jelly beans.  But sometimes you get those icky chalky jelly beans that are pretending to be gourmet and come at premium prices when you were expecting the Jelly Belly.
