Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I would like to thank Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba for the BEST worst service experience I have ever had. I have been here a few times before and have always had a good experience. This past Monday I went for brunch with a friend. Everything started off well: we sat on their cute patio, we ordered, and I took advantage of their Bloody Mary bar.
