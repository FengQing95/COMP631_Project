Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I do not think this type of pizza would do very well as a delivered item. You need to eat this fresh out of the oven. Maybe if you can heat it up properly at home? But the cheese (although not too much), was gooey and was melting, and it was a perfect layer of crust, sauce, cheese and toppings.
