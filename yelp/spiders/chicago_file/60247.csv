Smoque BBQ////But back to the most important part of Smoque -- the food. The ribs are cooked in a dry rub so don't expect messy, saucy ribs. They are tender and flavorful, with a sweet sauce on the side. The brisket was equally tender. It could have benefited from a bit more fat, and the accompanying sauce had a little too much acidity for my taste, but they were still good eats.
