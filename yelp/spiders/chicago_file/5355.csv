The Purple Pig////If you're coming during peak times, be prepared to wait! We put our name down and our wait was supposed to be 1-1:15 hours. The wait was cut a bit short because we indicated that we don't mind sitting outside. Although the wait was long, the service did not disappoint. We had a super bubbly waiter, and he was really helpful with walking me through the vegetarian options on the menu. The atmosphere is also very cozy at night, with dim fairy lights strung around the patio.
