Art Institute of Chicago////A must visit museum! Always housing the classics and a great place to stay current with all genres of art. They have a very clean facility well organized setup of rooms and friendly employees to assist. They had audio resources bag check in a gift shop and seating areas and elevators to accommodate as well. Many many exhibits would recommend a visit!
