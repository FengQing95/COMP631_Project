Smoque BBQ////Quite possibly the best restaurant in the USA. I guess for meat lovers like myself, anyway. Yes they will get your order wrong 90% of the time and yes bc they were on tv a while ago the line still snakes out the door, but it is so worth it, my friend. Try the brisket. Dreams, fantasies, voyages, treks were made based on this brisket.
