Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute is an absolute treasure. When I worked nearby, I would wander the halls over my lunch hour. Absolutely extraordinary art over so many genres and time periods. Worth a membership, because you're always discovering something new and can't really enjoy the museum in a single visit. I would recommend at least a separate visit to the Modern Wing.
