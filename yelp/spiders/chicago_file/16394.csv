Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visiting Chicago for the first time, I would be crazy if I didn't try the famous deep dish pizza. Three of us ordered a large house salad to share (a comically large portion size) and a deep dish sausage special. The salad wasn't anything special, although there was enough to feed about 15 people, but the pizza was everything I thought it would be. Very greasy, dense, and impossible to eat with your hands. My only complaint is that the pizza becomes less appetizing once it cools down, so hurry up and eat it as quickly as you can!
