Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The portions are huge.  I would even suggest sharing a entree if your not starving and don't have a fridge or microwave.  I tried the skillets on both days and all I can say is yummmmmm!  Your entree will include toast or a side of pancakes.  Both are very good and the toast is served with homemade preserves that are quite tasty.
