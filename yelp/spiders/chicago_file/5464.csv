The Purple Pig////If it hasn't been said before the wait is up there 2+hours.  Put your names in then have a drink somewhere. But be prepared to run.  You get 10 Minutes to get there after you get your text.  The service is spot in a large rotation of different staff taking care of you.  All the food we had was amazing!  Tapas style plates however the brussel sprouts are a meal themselves.  It will take probably 5 to 6 visits with a sizeable group the try the entire menu. And I would be excited to do so.  Very well prepared food thought and designed amazingly!
