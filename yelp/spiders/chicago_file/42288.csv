Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tapas + homemade deliciousness of sangria + paella= love party. It's not very expensive, the atmosphere is fun, the neighborhood is trendy and entertaining, and you will leave STUFFED. It's a good night out. If you haven't tried it yet, then get a move on. My favorite is still Iberico (the "patatas bravas" are mouth watering there, and it is cheaper), but when it comes to neighborhood and restaurant dining then this takes the cake of the two. I've always had great service.
