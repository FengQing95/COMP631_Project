Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Walking distance from downtown hotels. Short wait of 35 min due to weekend late night rush, with free samples of thin crust pizza. The option to pre-order pizza was amazing. Table of two seated promptly. The pizza smelled and tasted amazing. The Lou comes with classic buttercrust, and it was cooked to perfection. Restaurant has sports and Chicago memorabilia. Lovely dinner.
