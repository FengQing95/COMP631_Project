Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////What a delicious meal! The aged New York strip was incredible, the duck and goat cheese terrine was complex and savory, and the Mac and cheese was decadent. All of the staff was great, but Siaire went above and beyond too make my boyfriend's birthday special. Can't wait to come back!
