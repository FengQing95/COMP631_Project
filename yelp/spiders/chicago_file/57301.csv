Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Since it was our first time here, we decided to go with the more popular items, which were helpfully highlighted in red on the menu.  We ended up ordering at least one thing from every category, and they were all delicious.  Thankfully, the food also came with enough time in between each dish to enjoy each one properly.
