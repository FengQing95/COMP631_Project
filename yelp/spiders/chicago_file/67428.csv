Little Goat Diner////How can I rave about waffles?  We've all had waffles, right?  No biggie.  Oh, how wrong we can be.  These were the best waffles I have ever eaten.  I'm crying right now just thinking about them.  The Fat Elvis Waffles consist of two large rectangular waffles covered in sliced banana, peanut butter butter and maple syrup with crumbled bacon pieces.  Take your time; try not to hyperventilate.  This dish was an experience.  I was a little weary about the peanut butter butter, since PB can be so over powering, but this was how it should be.  Every flavor popped, made me contemplate how lucky I was to be eating it, and then slapped me in the face to take another bite.  Pure perfection.  Oh, here comes the sausage.  It wasn't brought out the same time as the main dish, most likely because it was being blessed by the Lord himself.  It was that fantastic.  Do yourself a favor and go to Big Fork's website to read about their products, you'll get a feeling of just how good this stuff is.  I love my meat, so having meat from animals that were cared for under a higher level of ethics says and means a lot.  You taste a difference trust me.  Lastly, we get to the pancakes.  The dough is made from a sour dough base, so they aren't overly sweet...good thing, the apples are fresh, large slices mixed right in the batter...another good thing and they are light and fluffy almost becoming one with your taste buds...yep, you guessed it.  Take all these flavors and mix in coffee from one of the best providers in the country and you have an experience worth five stars.  This place is pure culinary bliss.  Go, eat, experience.
