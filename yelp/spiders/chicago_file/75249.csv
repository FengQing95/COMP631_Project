Little Goat Diner////Absolutely wonderful! Made a reservation and got there early, they were able to sit us right away. Menu options are traditional diner meals with deliciously creative twists. We got the kimchi Ruben and the sesame biscuit with fried egg. Both were different then expected in the best ways possible. Delicious! Staff were great and fast
