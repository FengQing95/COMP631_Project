Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They warned us that it takes about 45 minutes to make; big SIGH as we were so hungry after our long flight, but it is well worth the wait! The crust that they use is delicious and has a sweet flavor to it and both the pizzas hit the spot, but after eating just 1 slice of the Chicago Classic, I couldn't finish the second Lou slice.
