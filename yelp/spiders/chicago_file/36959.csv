Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////There's no shortage of steak options in the city (and it seems like a new one opens each week) but even in a crowded field, Bavette's stands out. Has an old school steakhouse vibe but not in a stale/outdated way; the restaurant feels decidedly hip (part of this might be because it's the darkest restaurant I've ever dined in). In other words, you are just as likely to a see a young couple on a date as a big group celebrating a birthday. Also worth noting: restaurant remained full at all times without ever being too loud.
