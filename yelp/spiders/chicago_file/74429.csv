Little Goat Diner////Breakfast was probably 4.5 stars on its own. Coffee special was a blend of coffee and horchata. Yum! Sat at the bar and got a free cinnamon roll, which was, needless to say, pretty great. Hash browns were exactly to my liking: cut long and stringy using a spiral slicer, with just the right amount of crust. But I didn't even eat much of them, since I was too busy gorging myself on the This Piggy Went to China and the Bull's Eye French Toast. The former is an amalgam of biscuits, fried eggs, asian-spiced sausage, and some sort of sauce that was really zesty and tasty but a tad too salty when consumed in large quantities. The latter is a french toast made with sweet onion broche and served with barbecue maple syrup. It tasted weird at first, but was a real grower. By the time we finished it, I was enamored with it.
