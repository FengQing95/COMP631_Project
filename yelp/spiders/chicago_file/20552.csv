Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Went here because all of the hype and was let down by the overall experience. I had the butter crust deep dish with crumbled sausage and it felt like a kids pizza. Just gobs of cheese with no real flavor there sauce is good just not enough of it and the sausage was gross. Spinach bread was ok. And it took the waitress 30 minutes to refill our drinks.(that how long the pizza takes took cook). My girl got the thin crust and hers had barely any sauce and the cheese had a snap to it like it was microwaved.
