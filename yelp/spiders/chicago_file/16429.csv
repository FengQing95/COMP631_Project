Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Anyhoo...we were both surprised how non deep dish this looked when it arrived.  There was no massive wall o' crust just kind of a handtossed looking pizza that I could get anywhere really.  So we both took a bite and shrugged our shoulders and said at the same time "it's okay."  I don't know what the buttercrust was supposed to bring to the party but it tasted like crust.  It was the only crust I could actually eat though since it wasn't an entity in itself but I have to say it also left me still a little hungry when we left.  Thank God we'd stopped at a cupcake store beforehand so we could have cupcakes when we got back to the hotel!   If you're going to be getting a medium or larger, sign up for Malnati Mail a few days before you go so you can get a discount email.
