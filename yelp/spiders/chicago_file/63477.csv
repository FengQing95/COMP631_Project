Smoque BBQ////I love this place. Every time we go, the food is top notch. The people who work there are friendly and helpful. The restaurant and bathrooms are clean which is always important when you consider how clean the kitchen is. I've never had anything on the menu that I didn't enjoy. If I had one very minor complaint, it would be that sometimes the crowds make you feel pressured to get up the second you finish your meal. I personally enjoy letting my food digest for a minute as I engage in some after dinner conversation. That, however, is a personal feeling. Go here for great bbq.
