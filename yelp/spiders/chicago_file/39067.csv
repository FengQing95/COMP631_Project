Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We stayed in the downstairs Parlor! The atmosphere was remarkable - great lighting - furniture and decor. It was intimate and gave a great old school Chicago feel. The food was great! The Home Made Sourdough Bread was the best bread I have ever had! We had both shrimp appetizers - wedge salads - Fish SPECIAL -Bone in Rib Eye. Truffles Mac n Cheese - Brussel Sprouts and Mashed Potatoes! All fantastic! We finished the night with chocolate pie- great whipped cream! The server (Erik) was fantastic! The music in the parlor went perfect with atmosphere and kept your attention all night!
