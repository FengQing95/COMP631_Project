Little Goat Diner////Good food and ambience . It was a little noisy though. I would recommend to make reservations , it's easier to get here than the girl and the goat. We had a chicken sandwich and build your own burger with goat patty. It was delicious! Also the fries were amazing! Will go next time for milkshakes !
