Smoque BBQ////This place has the tastiest, juiciest, most delicious ribs I've ever had. I had the 1/2 rack ribs Memphis style. The Â ribs do look burnt but that's just the rub they put on it. You can tell time and love goes into making these ribs! Glad I stopped here on my winter Chicago vacation! It was worth the 30 minute metro ride from downtown!
