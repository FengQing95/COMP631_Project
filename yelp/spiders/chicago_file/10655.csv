Art Institute of Chicago////American Gothic was the other picture that we felt like we needed to see, and that thing is deep within the museum. The instructions included walk down a flight of stairs walk across the room go up some stairs go forward turn right walk down the hallway turn left it's at the end of the hallway. It's just best to ask somebody, and even though its small its definitely iconic and worth seeing. It's a great shout out to Eldon Iowa that boasts the home within the picture, and for all those interested, houses a lady who bakes pies on the weekends in the summer. All art aside, it's totally worth going to as the lemon pie is totally boss!
