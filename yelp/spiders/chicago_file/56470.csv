Smoque BBQ////Wow I was disappointed last nite.  What's going on?  Been here a number of times and the meat has been great but noticeably starting to change.  This time brisket was dry as a bone and st Louis  ribs were as well.  Thank goodness for some sauce to help ease that (used to be moist and delectable) dry brisket meat down.
