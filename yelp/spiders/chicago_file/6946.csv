Art Institute of Chicago////I go so often and stay for so long each time I'm pretty sure some of the security guards know me (esp. in the sections I like the best). The admission is pretty steep but I have literally never paid a cent and I've been there countless times. Obviously for visitors it's different, but if you're in the Chicago area, it's free every Wednesday (used to be only Thursday evenings). And generally if you use the side entrance, the line is shorter than the one on Michigan Ave.
