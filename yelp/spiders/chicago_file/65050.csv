Smoque BBQ////This place is fire.  If I lived by here I'd probably go once a week if not more.  Everything on the menu is great and the sauces are too.  I love to barbecue myself and strive to get results the way their food turns out.  To make it easy for you on deciding whether or not to go, you best just go.  You won't be mad.
