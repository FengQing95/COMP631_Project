Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////And we were not disappointed!!! We could tell from reviews that this place is popular and there would be a wait. We knew you could put your name on a list and pre-order your pie(s). When we arrived, we did just that and grabbed a drink at the bar while we waited. Our estimated wait of 25 minutes was only about 15 minutes.
