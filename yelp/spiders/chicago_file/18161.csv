Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm from NYC so I am a bit of a "pizza snob" according to friends. This was well worth the hype. Delicious sauce, perfect amount of cheese, buttery delicious flaky crust. Everything deep dish should be. It will be a staple stop for me every time I come here. I am still thinking about it 5 days later and may have to order it shipped to California.
