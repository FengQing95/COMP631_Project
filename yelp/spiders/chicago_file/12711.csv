Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visiting from out of town I was anxious to try some Chicago deep dish. We tried several pizza places during our trip and Lou malnati's was the best of the bunch, better than another place that maybe gets a little more attention. A great experience to go with some delicious pizza
