Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Sorry,  I just CANNOT patronize anymore of these over-priced, al a carte restaurants.  My tolerance just broke at Bavette's last Thurs night.  We went for a special occasion, treating a friend for their birthday and I put a good face on it.  But I am still seething over the lack of value and the fact that I put out the equivalent of the GDP of a small island nation for taste that did not WOW me.  Service was fine, nothing outstanding.  Décor is trendy, but dark, dark, dark.  Had to pull out the phones to light up our menus.  Maybe that was my mistake - I should have just pointed at something - saved myself the heart attack. 9 bucks for a baked sweet potato, 12 for mashed tates?  How much does a potato cost anyway? 8 cents, maybe!  Yeah, yeah I am paying for atmosphere, hipness, employing a few people, etc.  My husband had the Chicago rib eye.  Nothing on the plate except the steak and small cup of bernaise sauce - what? no sprig of parsley even?   based on his lack of "yum, yum" noises and one word description of 'Fine' I take it the steak was underwhelming.   We had sides of green beans and the elote corn - yawn.  I had the spicy fried chicken and the batter was too greasy for my taste and I had to remove most of it.  Although the chicken cutlet was juicy. We shared the crab & avocado salad, which turned out to be my favorite item of the evening - cost almost as much as my entrée.  I will give Bavette's a plus for a reasonable wines-by-the-glass price and selection.  happy to see a Gruner-Vietliner by the glass. So if you have more money than sense - Go, be hip, be seen (oh, wait - its too dark to be seen).
