Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My friend and I met up yesterday for lunch at Cafe BaBaReeba.  Who knew they had brunch?  Apparantly not many people, because the place was empty.  We sat on the heated patio, and were the ONLY people out there.  At noon.  On a Sunday.  (I laughed at the people waiting outside Nookies in the cold).
