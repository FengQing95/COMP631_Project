Smoque BBQ////The ribs are incredible and just put you over the top. When I dont have a lot of time I usually get the 1/2 pulled pork 1/2 brisket (sliced) sandwich, coleslaw and fries. Also an amazing choice. The pulled pork is tender and has a sweet and sassy bbq sauce. Macaroni and cheese is a delicious side as well if thats more to your liking. If you have room left over for desert, definetely try the peach cobbler, taste's like its from Georgia (if youve ever tried it). Absolutel must go!!!
