Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Look, I know it's a Lettuce restaurant, but I won't slight it for that. It is a GREAT local for a group dinner. About 6 of us went there for a bday dinner and everyone left stuffed and happy. Including the birthday girls' mom. While I think the "small plates" thing is kind of over, Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba has been doing it for a while and does it right. Great sangria, and I think once the bill came we each owed about $25.00. Perfect.
