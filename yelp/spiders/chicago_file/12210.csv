Art Institute of Chicago////I actually learned how to open and flip through books properly in the library here. Love the openness of the Modern Wing, the stuff in it ranges from contemporary to experimental. Some are super cool, and the collection do change often. The gift shop also has some gems (books or play things) you can't find online.
