Little Goat Diner////Nitpicking aside, I did think that our overall meal was delicious. The portion sizes were slightly small and it was a bit pricey, but I thought the flavors were pretty good. The concept of elevated Asian fusion diner food can be difficult to execute but Little Goat is able to produce dishes that would make customers come back to try more.
