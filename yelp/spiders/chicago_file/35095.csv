Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////4.5...Dark & swank this is a hidden gem. Very expensive but quite tasty. Service friendly and smooth. Combo oysters then petite filet crazy good. Perfect dry martini too!Truffle mac&cheese delightful. Enjoyed biz dinner and would suggest to all but lighting then noise level makes for communication challenge.
