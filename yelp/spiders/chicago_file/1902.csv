Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I'm a pancake connoisseur and when I say these pancakes were amazing I mean it. Wow. Its now 2015 and I still have yet to find ANY pancake spot that tops this place. The pancakes were not too dry or too moist.. the were "just right" as Goldilocks would say lol. I'm usually a pancake purist and like my pancakes plain but with a name that has "berry" in it I decided I would try a few of my pancakes with berries on it.. Fireworks went off in my mouth in celebration.
