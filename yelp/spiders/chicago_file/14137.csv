Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ok... ordered the same exact thing from gold coast location 2 nights ago. ... Gave it a 5.. If I could Rank this location a 0, I would. Pizza was cold, Â had a brown greenish tint on top. ... Not worth calling and complaining. . It took 80 minutes to get here. . Last time for me.. Thank you lou for convincing me Chicago pizza is shit compared to NY style
