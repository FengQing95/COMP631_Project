Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We arrived around 11:15am, so the restaurant was still fairly empty as they had just opened. All of us had our carry-on luggage. We asked for a table for 6, and they took a minute to seat us. The staff decided to seat us upstairs- keep in mind there were clear tables on the ground level- so we all had to carry our bags up to their second floor. Our table wasn't yet ready, so we waited near another table that was set up for 7, and asked if it would be ok if we sat there. The waitress said no, and explained that the table was set up for 9, despite only seeing 7 place settings... and proceeded to seat us at a table in the far back, by a service door, and next to a large group on a food tour.
