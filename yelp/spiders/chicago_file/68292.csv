Little Goat Diner////We started with the crisp shrimp cocktail.  So yummy.  The shrimp was large and flavorful.  Definitely would order that again!  My husband ordered the farmer's pie and me, being the 11 year old that I am, I ordered the fat club with a side of garlic mashed potatoes.  Best club sandwich of my life!!!!!!!  It's towering, stocked with yummy meat and fresh veggies.  And the fat toast?!  Amazing!!  I loved the mashed potatoes too.  I ordered it without gravy, but it came to our table with gravy on it.  Our waitress came by and asked if I wanted her to send it back but I said no, that I liked it with the gravy actually.  My husband enjoyed his entree as well, cleaning the entire bowl.
