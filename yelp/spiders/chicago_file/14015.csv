Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Of all the Chicago-style pizza chains, Lou Malnati's is the best. The buttery crust and the fresh tomato sauce are great. Clutch toppings are spinach and sausage.  You can really taste how fresh the ingredients are and I can't stress that enough.  A bit pricey, but a great atmosphere for entertaining out-of-towners.
