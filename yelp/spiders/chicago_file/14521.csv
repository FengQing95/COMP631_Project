Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Its a scientific fact that Chicago deep dish is far superior to any other type of pizza known to man, and Lou Malnati's has perfected the craft.  Whenever I am in Chicago I will stop in for a fresh deep dish sausage pizza.  Since that's a pretty rare occasion though, I like to order pies off their website and have them overnight shipped to my house.  You can barely tell the difference, and it isn't even that pricey to do it!
