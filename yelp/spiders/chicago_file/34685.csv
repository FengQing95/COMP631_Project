Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I think I have my found my new favorite place in town.  Bavette's is great; it's everything I had hoped Maude's would be, and more!  The ambiance is beautiful, it's as though you walked into Babette's Supper Club on Boardwalk Empire... I take it Brendan Sodikoff is a huge fan, it's ok, so am I!  From the 1920's themed music, to the rich velvet and dark wood, Bavette's will make you feel comfortable and encourage you to stay awhile.
