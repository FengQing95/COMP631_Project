Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////What a great vibe! Love their tapas-style food, but their sangria is where it is at!! The pear-elderflower sangria was delicious. If you're a vegetarian like me, the stuffed mushrooms, patatas bravas with tomato ailoli, and brussel sprout salad are great choices. I was way too hungry for pictures :)
