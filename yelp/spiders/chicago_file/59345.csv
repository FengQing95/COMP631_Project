Smoque BBQ////Simply the best ribs I've ever tasted, got there before the lunch crowd around 1130 on a Thursday there were plenty of seats to be had.                                                                I originally wanted the St. Louis style ribs but there was a wait. So I opted for the regular baby backs instead. while enjoying my meal the gentleman I placed my order with (who I believe to be manger)  came out from the kitchen and informed me the st.louis ribs were cooked and he would bring them out, I declined because I already had a half slab but he insisted. He came back with a half slab of the st.louis style on the house! both ribs were dry rub. I'd say if you a dry rub fan this is the place for you. It was nice to see a business that cared enough to go the extra mile for its customers even on my first visit there.
