Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I had breakfast there this morning, and it was delectable- eggs (scrambled) applewood bacon, hashbrowns and plain pancakes. I'll go ahead and admit it now- I'm a purist. They have a bunch of specialty pancakes on the menu, but I like mine with maple syrup and butter, and that's it. I will definitely PASS on the Oreo S'more pancakes with marshmallow fluff, choc chips and oreo cookie crumbs, ($8.95) thankyouverymuch. The cakes I had were absolutely delicious!!!!!!
