Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I hadn't been there for 2-3 years, but just went back this past weekend and had a good time.  We had a ton of good and decent amount to drink and only spent about $50 a person.  It's a little hectic/busy/crowded, but sometimes that's the price you pay for a restaurant that is doing most things right.
