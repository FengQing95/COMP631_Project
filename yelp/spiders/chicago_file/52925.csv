Smoque BBQ////This place is great- consistently great food. Love it, meat is never fatty and when you order to-go they let you put sauce on yourself. Their fries are sinful, baked beans are so tasty as is the cornbread. Peach cobbler is yummy and not too sweet. If you like bbq you will not be disappointed.
