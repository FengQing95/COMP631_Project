Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Love this Pizzeria! The deep dish pizza is really delish and you're full after a slice or two! waiters are usually nice too. I tried the dessert there and there wasn't much to choose from and it wasn't that great, the tirmsui was so soggy! It's not a place for desserts though so I'm not that bothered about it.
