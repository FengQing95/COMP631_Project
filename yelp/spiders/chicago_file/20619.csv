Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place gets a five star rating from me. It was so AMAZING! It was the best pizza I have ever had in my life. The tomato sauce on the pizza is so rich. I got a deep dish pepperoni pizza with extra cheese and garlic. My boyfriend got sausage on his as well. We both love it. Also we got Chicken Marsala Rigatoni pasta that was absolutely delicious. The wine was even great! I highly recommend this place if you are coming to Chicago. Love love love!
