Little Goat Diner////We had a reservation for 2:15 pm for a late lunch and overall service was pretty good. We ordered the goat chili cheese fries and the macho nachos as appetizers, both of which were delicious and very satisfying. I love that the place has a diner feel but reinvents the dishes to make everything a little more interesting. The chili was made with goat (of course) and had a nice subtly different taste to it. Â The nachos were even better, with unique masa-based chips and delicious toppings. Unfortunately, that's where the highlights for us stopped as the entrees paled in comparison. Part of the reason was that the "snacks" we ordered were very heavy and also came in very large portions which probably took away from the entrees a bit. But even so, none of us were really impressed with the entrees we ordered (Bull's Eye French Toast, Fish Tostada, Okonomiyaki, etc.) That's not to say anything was bad at all -- just underwhelming. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I probably wouldn't recommend this place if you're only interested in it for the hype. I can't say it's not worth a try because you might like it better than I did, but I have to say it wouldn't make the top of my list for places to try in West Loop.
