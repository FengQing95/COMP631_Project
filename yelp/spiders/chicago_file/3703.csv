The Purple Pig////As I knew the wait can be long but sometimes you get lucky. 2 seats opened up as my friend and I got our drinks at the bar. That was awesome! Only about a 15 min wait. The bar is open seating. The server and bartender that was helping us was amazing. So funny, friendly and amazing.
