Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Brunch here is awesome! The concept of tapas may sound like it's not enough food but trust me, it's enough! They have a bloody mary bar that's very generous with it's toppings: bacon, cocktail onions, celery, hot peppers, hot sauce, carrots, pickles, olives, to name a few. Honestly, I take a bunch of bacon and eat it as a breakfast side when I order the bloodys.
