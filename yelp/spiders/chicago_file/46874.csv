Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went here for the first time the other night and it definitely lived up to the hype! Had the pintxos platter to start (the bacon/chorizo date was the best!). We got the spicy potatoes, hangar steak, the fried chicken thigh (so good, tasted like fancy wings!), and the shrimp. And drank the classic red sangria and passion fruit sangria. Everything was great and our waiter was so knowledgeable and attentive.
