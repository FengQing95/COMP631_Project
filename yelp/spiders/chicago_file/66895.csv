Little Goat Diner////I had the patty melt with beef and it was good, though slightly salty.  The hashbrowns were deliciously crispy and noodle-like- but I didn't eat mine, I had my cousins.  The cheese in the hashbrowns is goat cheese and I'm not a fan of that.  I assumed it would be American or even cheddar, but since the place is called "Little Goat," maybe I assumed wrong? Without the cheese, the hashbrowns were good though.
