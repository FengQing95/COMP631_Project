Art Institute of Chicago////What I did do is get there about an hour before it closed. You'd think that would be a waste: you'd be wrong! The price of the entrance ticket gets cut in half an hour before closing (Tip alert!). Having never been here before, I ran to see as many of the classics as I could: Nighthawks, The Bath, American Gothic, etc. It was a treat for the eyes, a feast for the soul!
