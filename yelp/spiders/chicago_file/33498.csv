Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. We have been to many steak restaurants around the city but I believe this to be the best. First off, the ambience is so cool and fun. The upstairs is very swanky and loud but cool sceney. The parlor is downstairs, darker but more prohibition-era. We are down there. The wait staff was very friendly and knowledgable. We ordered oysters as an app. The presentation was phenomenal and the taste was incredible. We also orders tasty cocktails as well. For the main event we ordered different types and cuts of steak but both were to our liking. It can be tough to get into but well worth the wait and early dinner reservation time. We can't wait to go back!
