Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////At first glance it reminded me most (of all the pizza's I had tonight) of Uno, which has been my only experience before tonight of "Chicago Pizza"  I had the pepperoni and sausage topping (butter crust) both had just a little bite to them and they were cooked to absolute perfection merging with the cheese.  The crust is what I had been hoping for in a Chicago deep dish-thick, rich, buttery and deeper than the hole that Jimmy Hoffa was thrown into.  Bottom line....if you are looking for the true Chicago deep dish experience this is the royal flush.
