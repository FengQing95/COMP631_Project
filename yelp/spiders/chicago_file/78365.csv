Little Goat Diner////Second tip: If you cant get in the restaurant, at least go to the bakery which is connected as well. If I weren't so full every time, I would order all the pastries (looking at you Cinnabun) because those look solid. I mean it's attached to their bakery. That indicates to me fresh and homemade.
