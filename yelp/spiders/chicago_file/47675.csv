Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I recently used their catering service. The package was ok but I wished I knew earlier or thought of it that hot tapas are supposed to be hot...they are not that good cold. Cafe Ba-ba-Reba catered food but nothing else and did not suggest how to keep the food warm. So maybe it is me, maybe it is them but my hot tapas were cold and I did not like.
