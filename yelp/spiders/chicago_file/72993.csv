Little Goat Diner////next time I went I ordered the Tonkatsu sammich and it did not dissapoint! I love tonkatsu sandwiches and Little Goat's version was SUPER DELICIOUS. Loved the combination with cabbage and pickled banana peppers. being the fatty that I am I also ordered a side of mac and cheese which was also super tasty. Not overly cheesy and didn't have an overbearing amount of truffle oil either. I tried the tomato apple soup which was also good, but the only comment I would have on that is that I didn't really taste any apple in the soup. Just tasted like tomato, but I finished the whole damn bowl anyway.
