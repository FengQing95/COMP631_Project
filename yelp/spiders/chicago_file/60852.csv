Smoque BBQ////I ordered the sliced brisket platter with cornbread and baked beans. The meat was TENDER, the flavor with the sauce served on the side was -Ful as in flavorFul, Â but in my opinion the taste was not hitting the spot for me. Corn bread comes served in it's own foil cup and the beans were chock-ful of pieces of pork and onion with just the right sweetness. Cole slaw was fresh and had good proportion of tart and sweet with crunch.
