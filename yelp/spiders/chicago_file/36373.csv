Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I made reservations about a month in advance for a Sunday at 5:30 p.m.  It was definitely tricky.  I wanted to make reservations about two weeks prior, but it was impossible!  Oh well, some celebratory dinners are worth waiting for.  If you want to dine at Bavette's, plan ahead.  When we arrived for our reservation, the restaurant had plenty of tables open - and it stayed that way until we left.  Walking in on a Sunday night is definitely a do-able option.
