Little Goat Diner////I actually love that from certain booths you can see the food being put out on the "to be served" counter because it allowed my fianc√© and I to get some ideas of what we wanted. Once he saw that giant burger come out, it was game over. So naturally that's what he ordered (Goat Almighty). And I went with the machos nachos because even from afar I was drooling over them.
