Little Goat Diner////Overall--the food was good, it was a good environment, and for the price, it was definitely worth it. It's not too expensive and a nice night out. I can't wait to go back and eat breakfast instead of dinner (which they serve all day!). I should also say that there were so many things on the menu that I really want to eat and didn't order (fried pickles and onions!!). I cannot wait to go back and try some of these things!!
