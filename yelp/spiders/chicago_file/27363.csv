Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were greeted by our waitress Laura from the minute we walked in and asked us if we were first timers. I assume being such a popular establishment that is usually the first question to ask. Laura explained the menu to us and even added on an informative tip of it taking 30 minutes for the pizza to be made. With that in mind we started off with ordering the garlic bread for an app. Garlic bread was delicious. It was perfectly drizzled with just the right amount of garlic and olive oil. Good choice.
