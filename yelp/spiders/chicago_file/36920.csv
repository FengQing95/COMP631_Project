Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Now we have a chipped glass, an almost raw piece of meat, and not so attentive service.  Wouldn't be all that annoying except the $$$ on the bill.  Not even a comp'd drink for the hiccups?  Maybe the offer of a complimentary dessert to apologize for the little snafus?  Nope.
