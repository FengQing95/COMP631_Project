Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came in to this popular restaurant on New Years Day, and was seated in less than 20 minutes. Service was great, but food did not live up to the hype. Food was served warm to cold, and the taste did not jump out as a great pizza. Buffalo wings were salty and calamari was soggy, not crispy. If you have to try it, by all means, but be prepared to bring your jacket on a cold day (even when you're seated) and hope you don't come on an off day for the place (despite the service being 5-star quality).
