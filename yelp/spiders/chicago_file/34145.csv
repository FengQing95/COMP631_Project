Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Freaking ridiculous had the stroganoff( get it ), fried chicken, bone marrow, creamed spinach, whiskey ice cream. Service was perfect cocktails excellent and really enjoyed talking to the hostess walked us through the menu and her suggestions where on point. Will be heading back there Â to try the pork chop and everything else on that menu. There truly was absolutely nothing I could complain about the place loved the decor. My kind of spot 1920's baby!
