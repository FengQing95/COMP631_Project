Smoque BBQ////As I wait for that fateful day when my folks venture forth from those sylvan groves of the North Shore and cry, "Child, take us to Uncle John's (or Barbara Ann's)," Smoque does quite nicely, thank you very much. Once you get over the unbearable whiteness of being (a snazzy bbq in Old Irving Park while Honey I et al. struggle elsewhere), it's not hard to appreciate that Barry and Co. are the area's best emulators, which is saying something, given how many false promises of real 'cue this city has gotten before. Best news: this is not boiled meat jello. It's not Hill Country, but it's probably as close as we'll get it: the brisket is, as noted before, excellent; sauce comes on the side, thank cheesus; ribs are pink-y and have an excellent chew (I sound like Pat Bruno, sorry). Sides are not ignored, surprising for a BBQ joint; go for the beans.
