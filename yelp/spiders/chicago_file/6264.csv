The Purple Pig////Chicken thigh kebabs-You get two perfectly seasoned chicken kebabs on top of four fried smashed potatoes with Tzatziki sauce at the bottom. The chicken was very tender and went perfectly with their tasty tzatziki sauce. The potatoes we're good and worked as a starchy filler. The dish was tasty but $20 for two chicken kebabs was a tad bit much. Wouldn't mind ordering again, but would probably try some other plates next time.
