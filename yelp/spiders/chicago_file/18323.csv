Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I always recommend Lou Malnati's! Normally, I'm not a big fan of deep dish pizza, but the crust here is so good. It's crisp and the buttery crust I highly recommend. There's usually a wait, but they take orders while you wait which makes it seem faster. If you're in the area try it! I prefer Lou Malnati's over Giordano's hands down.
