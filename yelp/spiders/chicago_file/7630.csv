Art Institute of Chicago////I have traveled extensively and always enjoy visiting art museums, but there is none greater than the Art Institute of Chicago.  The permanent collections are fabulous and the ones that are here for a short time are of the highest caliber.  There are special programs year round and the restaurants are also 5-star quality.  I have gone as a teacher taking students on a field trip, as a mother bringing her own children and I've gone many times by myself to just be immersed in art and history and culture.  I recommend the Art Institute as a must-see if anyone is coming to Chicago for the first time.
