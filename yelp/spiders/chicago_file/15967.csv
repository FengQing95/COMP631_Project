Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I love gourmet pizza. I hail from LA and think Mozza holds the crown for amazing puffy, charred crust and homemade sauce and toppings. Lou's is not like that. It's a different ballgame altogether and it is the champion as far as I'm concerned. The buttermilk crust is absolutely fantastic and unlike any other crust I've had. It stays crispy throughout (even in dead center of the pizza with all the weight of the sauce and toppings) and the light sausage on the classic was delicious! It was a perfect balance of sauce:cheese:meat:crust. Excellent service as well.
