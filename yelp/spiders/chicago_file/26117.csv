Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Leaving Chicago wasn't too difficult when I moved to Los Angeles...however the thing I missed most of all after Ravinia - see review- and of course my family and friends was Lou Malnatis! It's the best comfort food ever. The cheese- even low fat is amazing. It's flavorful and not overpowering. Â The deep dish crust is the main thing that makes Lou's special. The Lou's salad is also fabulous with delicious dressing and tons of mushrooms. I literally order it to be flown in for special occasions
