Smoque BBQ////I have been to Smoque several times.  The food and service are consistently good.  As a Texas transplant, I can be pretty skeptical about Chicago BBQ, but Smoque exceeds my expectations every time.   The sliced/chopped beef sandwiches are top notch and served with a nice portion of meat.  The slaw and cornbread are great.  Skip the mac-n-cheese....not terrible, but nothing to write home about.   St. Louis ribs are better than baby back.   The setup can feel a little overwhelming, as there is usually a long line when you walk in...give it a chance, the staff has it down to a science and the line goes fast.  You order at the counter and then a member of the Smoque team will help you find somewhere to sit.  The tables are family style.   I recently moved to the other side of the city but I will more than likely be back to get my BBQ fix.
