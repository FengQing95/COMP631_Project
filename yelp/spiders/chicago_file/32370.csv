Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Eating deep dish pizzas around the country, I can see why people may prefer their own city's style since it may be less flaky, or sweeter, or have heavier spices. To me, this classic is the foundation for deep dish pizza. As I am told by every native in Chicago, Lou's is the OG of deep dish.
