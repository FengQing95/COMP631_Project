Smoque BBQ////I enjoyed the pulled pork as well -- I can't think of a better place for pulled pork in Chicago, but Smoque's version doesn't really stand out either.  I think that's because pulled pork is a little easier than Brisket to get right (you can easily make a pretty decent "faux-smoked" version in any Chicago kitchen just by browning a big pork shoulder roast and then letting it cook all day in the slow-cooker, bathed in about half a bottle of Liquid Smoke -- no other liquid is necessary.  Pull it apart when you're done, and taste the goodness).
