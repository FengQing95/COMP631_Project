Art Institute of Chicago////One of the things that was suggested as a must do in Chicago. Tickets were $20/person. Â While I am not an art person, it definitely was a very nice art museum. A lot bigger than I thought, and very well put together. There are so many floors of tons of art everywhere. There's so much to see. We got to see the Obama portraits which was cool. They have you put yourself on a virtual line with a QR code and would text you when it's your turn to enter to see the Obama portraits since it's such a popular exhibit right now. There were a few Van Gogh artworks, as well as his self portrait which was kinda cool to see.
