Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were in Chicago for a last second trip and what a great time.  We went on a Saturday night so there was a little bit of a wait but it wasnt that bad.  All the apps that we had were amazing as well as the service.  Our waitress was quick and friendly.  Cant say that I was the biggest of fans of deep dish pizza before (maybe because this was my first time having it in Chicago)  but Lous did not disappoint!  We got a couple pies plus the apps for the 4 of us and couldnt even come close to finishing everything!  The pizza was great the next day for leftovers and will be returning next time I come to Chicago!
