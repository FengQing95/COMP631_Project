Smoque BBQ////Not impressed.. heard rave reviews from co-workers and even saw a blurb about it on TV. But honestly didn't have anything that was "great" just kinda OK... not a fan of the runny BBQ sauce. Tried the pulled pork and the brisket.. brisket was mushy and fatty.. pork was stringy and tough.. The Brisket Chili was decent, although it was near boiling when we got it, couldn't eat it until almost the end of our meal.. Also the "shot glass" size Mac n Cheese was tasty, but seems like they could have had served a slightly larger portion. Â Maybe it was a bad night for Smoque, but I've definitely had better BBQ elsewhere..
