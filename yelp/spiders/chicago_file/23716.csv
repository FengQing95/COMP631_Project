Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It was okay. I have to admit I am not a huge pizza fan. It's never my first pick, atleast not recently. We ordered the crust less pizza which is made with a sausage crust. And a regular pepperoni pizza. Both small and both filling between four people. We had leftovers. We also ordered wings, maybe that's why. But it's worth a visit. I liked this we were able to order the pizza while we waited 45 mins, so when we sat, the pizza was ready shortly after. Very efficient
