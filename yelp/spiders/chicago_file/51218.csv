Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been eyeing this place for a while now ever since it came up on a random google search for good sangria spots. I finally got to try it for Sunday brunch. I came with two of my friends. We tried all assortment of tapas and they did not disappointment. This place is great for groups because you can share different appetizers with others at your table. I definitely was in food heaven. Didn't order the dish, but got to taste it anyways.The Sangrias didn't disappoint either. We got a pitcher of the passion fruit sangria.I will be back to try some of the other delicious sangrias they have on their menu along with tapas. Next time, I'll make reservations beforehand. We didn't and was informed that it would be a 25 min wait for a table. It took a little longer than 25 mins for a table to be available and since we were hungry, we ended up eating at the bar. Never the less, good times were had by all.
