Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First stop in Chicago was Lou Malnati's. We had to experience what a real deep dish pizza tastes like! It was pretty busy since we went during lunch time, but the staff were friendly and hardworking! We couldn't finish our food since they're super generous with portions, so we took the rest to-go. Still tastes good when you reheat it.
