Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I had the simple deep dish pepperoni with the butter crust and it was a pizza experience. I'm talking true Chicago-style pizza; no bullshit. I've been really serious and pumped about Â the authenticity and quality of Chicago-style pizza all over for about three years now and I can honestly say that Lou Malnati's knows how to take care of business in Chicago.
