Smoque BBQ////I went to Smoque a few years ago and was underwhelmed, but upon my latest visit (about a week ago), I was blown away.  We waited about half an hour in line before getting our food and were tempted to go somewhere else.  I am so glad we didn't because the food was amazing.  My husband and I ordered a lot -- the brisket and pulled pork sandwiches, fries, colewslaw, cornbread and peach cobbler.  Each and every dish was absolutely amazing.  There's really nothing more to say.  This is the only place that rivals Fat Willy's, in my opinion, and I've been to most of the BBQ joints on the North Side.
