Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We had the bone in ribeye, petite filet, smashed potatoes (omg!), brussel sprouts, and shrimp cocktail to eat. And started the night with great cocktails followed by wine. All in all it was a wonderful dining experience. Loved the romantic feel of the booths and the dark ambiance. Very fun!
