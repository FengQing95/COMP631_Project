Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////In conclusion, I clearly did not enjoy waiting 45 minutes for my pizza even when there were hardly any other patrons dining.  I just can't seem to fathom that it actually takes that long for the pizza to cook.  It is absolutely mind boggling.  They were pretty stingy on the toppings too.    As my first deep dish experience in Chicago, this place was a let down.  One up side of our experience was that the service was great, and our guy was super friendly and helpful.
