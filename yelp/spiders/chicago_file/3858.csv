The Purple Pig////Was the guest for a business lunch here the second week of July. Two of the dishes (the ravioli and the broccoli) were literally inedible. It tasted as if gasoline had been poured over them. Not only that, the broccoli was smothered in about a cup of mayonnaise, then had the gasoline poured on it. Â This is a tapas-themed restaurants, which is probably not wise during a pandemic, but they make it worse by not providing enough serving spoons, which is insane. We kept asking for serving spoons, and would get one teaspoon. So there we were, three unrelated people, trying desperately not to share germs; it was just impossible. On top of that, the restaurant was extremely crowded and poorly ventilated. The windows and doors were all closed. No servers were wearing masks and the restaurant is so noisy they were six inches away from my face while speaking. Yes, I am fully vaccinated, but that is only 85% effective against Delta. The place is a public health disaster waiting to happen. As for the food, well, the tuna tartare was great, the rice balls acceptable, but all I keep thinking about is how horrible the other two dishes were.
