Smoque BBQ////The food is amazing, especially the perfectly smoked BBQ. Sides are great too, the beans are just awesome. Don't expect to sit and have a private, cozy conversation; the tables are pushed together and the dining area is small. My spouse and I enjoyed eating in but with the small, tight space we'd probably not bring our little kids here. We'll be back and probably do takeout. If you're thinking about trying it, do not hesitate, especially if you like BBQ (and know what is "good" BBQ a la Memphis/Texas)! Â The food is worth it!
