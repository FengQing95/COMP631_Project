Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Food - Ordered a bunch of pintxos (waffle-battered chicken stick, potato & egg bite, deviled egg w/ bacon) as well as some tapas (sausage fried paella w/ poached egg and bacon mac n/cheese). While the waffled chicken stick was tasty, pretty much everything else we ordered was very bland. I was especially disappointed with the bacon mac n/cheese which was literally just two strips of bacon placed on a plate of watery mac n/cheese. The paella was also flavorless, and the rice was crusty and dry. Also, at least two individuals in our group had eggs that were under cooked which was surprising given the number of egg based items are on the menu (you'd think they could get that right).
