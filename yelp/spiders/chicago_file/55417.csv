Smoque BBQ////I can't say enough about how fantastic the pulled pork was.  It was juicy and tasty and complex.  The barbecue sauce was tart and vinegary and really perfect.  I thought the baked beans were great too.  The brisket was well cooked and tasty.  I'll pass on the cole slaw next time though.
