Smoque BBQ////Despite the daunting line, Smoque seems to have a system worked out pretty well where you put your order in and once a table is ready, your food is shortly afterwards. For the food, I had the baby back ribs, which weren't as tender as I'm accustomed to, but were very flavorful and delicious with the BBQ sauce. The cornbread was decent, but the mac and cheese...oh the mac and cheese. Absolutely fantastic! I would order extra mac and cheese next time because one little tin of it is not enough! From the crumbled cheese crunchiness on top to the slightly smoked cheesiness inside, this is a must get. I'll be back to get the mac and cheese again...oh and probably try another entree!
