Smoque BBQ////their brisket is some of the best i've ever had, anywhere. and i love the peach cobbler, not too sweet and just the right amount to end your meal with. the ribs were delicious and juicy, though i didn't like the st. louis cut as well. the mac n cheese is so good, never too salty, and it had that little bit of bread crumb on the top and the noodles are always cooked perfect.
