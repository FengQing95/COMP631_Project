Little Goat Diner////I highly recommend the This Piggy Went to China, Bull's Eye French Toast and Parathas Burrito. This Piggy Went to China is an asian fusion biscuit with egg and sausage. You'll love the chili garlic sauce and how savory it is. It's small size is very deceiving. I love how the Bull's Eyes French Toast has an egg incorporated into each toast and how it's topped with strawberries. You don't even need to ask for maple syrup on the side because it's drenched in it. The Parathas Burrito is surprisingly good. It's a sunny side egg wrapped in an indian flat bread topped with a whopping amount of avocado, salad, red kidney beans and pickles. The menu description doesn't even adequately describe how good it is. The side of orange sauce and the pickled vegetables make the dish. You can't go wrong with their special omlettes either.
