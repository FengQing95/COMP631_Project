Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is one of my favorite places in Chicago! The vibe is awesome and they are really great with special food diets! They even have a really good gluten free bread (important with their spreadable and soupy tapas items)! My favorite item on the menu is the broccoli manchego salad - it has a wonderful crunch and a ton of manchego!
