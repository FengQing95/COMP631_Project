Smoque BBQ////Truly excellent bbq. Â Beef brisket is moist and tasty. Baked beans are absolutely delicious. Cole slaw is vinegar based, fresh-tasting, and unique (with red onions). Sauce is spicy without being overbearing. Atmosphere is very casual. Wish they had wireless for customers, but I can see they like to move people in and out. I will definitely return!
