Smoque BBQ////Fantastic BBQ .We drive along way to get here,well worth the trip.Sides are just as good the Peach cobbler is one of the best I have ever had.Parking sucks,but that part of being in the city.The service is good they have always been very friendly.Have not had to wait but we have been lucky,the first time we went we got right in,sat down with our food looked up and all of a sudden the line was out the door and down the sidewalk.
