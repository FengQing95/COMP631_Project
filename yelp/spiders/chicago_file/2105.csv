Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Tourist trap if I've ever seen one. Hour and a half wait (granted that was told upfront). Eggs weren't cooked to spec even after sending back. Waitress spilled water on my friend. I could have gotten better food at Waffle House (not joking). Highly recommend avoiding this place and going somewhere else.
