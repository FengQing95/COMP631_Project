Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////But having said that, Brittney worked very hard to redeem our experience and made an honest, heartfelt effort to apologize and make up for Bavette's one big error. Having spoken to her and seeing her effort at trying to restore our evening after the fact, as best a person can do, I feel compelled to honor her effort and say "Thank you". And because of her reaching out, I'll update this review and, in my mind's eye, simply erase the offending music, review that evening as it happened 'sans hip hop' and focus on the rest of what we experienced.
