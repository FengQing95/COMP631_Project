Art Institute of Chicago////The museum is HUGE and we didn't get time to explore each section before it closed but we were able to see most of the pieces we wanted to in person. My favorite section was Impressionism..the most impressive collection of Monet I have other seen (it was interesting to see his similar pieces side by side along one wall) and lots of Degas. I didn't expect Seurat's A Sunday on La Grande Jatte to be so big! It was very cool to see it from far away and up close. Another popular one that we really wanted to see was Hopper's Nighthawks.
