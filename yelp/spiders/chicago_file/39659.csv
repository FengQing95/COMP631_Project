Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////In our party of four we decided to start with a seafood platter...we chose the Grand Shellfish...plenty of prepared shrimp, a lobster cooked...shelled...and put back in its skin for eating, and lots of crab meat prepared for the diner...all-in-all this entry was delish. All the seafood was prepared and presented so all one had to do was enjoy with their little fork...no digging out lobster meat needed. Nice start for our table of four.
