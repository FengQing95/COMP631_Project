Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The steaks were super tender and very moist. Flavor was incredible. Their fries on the side... gotta tell you. Never knew that such cheap food could be made so well! Crab cakes are so moist, tender, and with generous amount of crab. The truffle mac was so cheesy and delicious.
