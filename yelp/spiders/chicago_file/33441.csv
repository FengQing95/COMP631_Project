Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The sides were simple flavor with brilliant execution.  At the time, asparagus was in season, so I had a few giant sprigs, and another side of the buttery mashed potatoes.  Both were likewise prepared to perfection, as the asparagus had a slight grill mark on it, and the potatoes had a smooth texture that helped them slowly melt in your mouth.
