Little Goat Diner////Came here randomly for dessert after having dinner somewhere else and their pretzel sundae was awesome! Wasn't expecting such a huge sundae. The ice cream was so unique and addicting! Service was also on point not to mention the latte I got was fire as well. Great ambience & lighting. Will definitely like to come back for some breakfast next time!
