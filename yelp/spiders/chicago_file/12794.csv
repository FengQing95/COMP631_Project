Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Really Really Good deep dish pizza. The crust has the right texture and just enough salt, The sauce is tangy and fresh tasting and the sausage is rich and not greasy with the little bits of fennel. The cheese balance is perfect. For thin crust I like Ranalli's on Lincoln the best.
