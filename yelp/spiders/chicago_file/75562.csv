Little Goat Diner////I have to take one star off just for the comfort of the restaurant. It is always so noisy that you can barely hear the people at your table. Also, it is quite cold near the windows in winter, and a lot of the booths are right there. I feel like it is designed to be noisy, but I really dislike that part. Also, valet is more expensive than the meal!
