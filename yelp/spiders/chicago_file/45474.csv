Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////There were three of us when we came in, so we got to try at least one of everything on the restaurant week menu, which was great at only $22 per person for four courses. For the appetizer course, there was the option of either a brussel sprout salad or chorizo chickpea soup. I ordered the salad, which was great! The crunch from the almonds was a nice touch. Then for the first tapas course, we had two ordered of the tortilla espanola and one for the patatas bravas. LOVED the aioli with the patatas bravas. They had a fantastic spice. The tortilla espanola was probably my favorite thing from the whole meal. It came with some kind of sour cream that went together perfectly with the warm potato omelette. For the second tapa we had the chicken and chorizo skewer, the flank steak, and the garlic shrimp. The steak was very tender and had a great sauce and the chicken and chorizo were great! Even though the chorizo wasn't spicy, it still had a great flavor. However, the garlic shrimp was fantastic; definitely a favorite of that course. The garlic taste wasn't overpowering, and they were seasoned perfectly! For dessert, our waiter informed us that we could order any dessert, not just the ones off the dessert restaurant week menu. We ordered the caramel marcona almond bar, the carmelized banana with quince syrup and vanilla ice cream, and the apple empanada. The desserts came small and just perfect as to not be overly-filling. The caramel bar was heavenly! The thick, gooey caramel with the buttery crust was delish. The banana was our second favorite; the warm banana with the cold ice cream was a great combo. The apple empanada was tasty as well! Loved the warm apple in the light pastry.
