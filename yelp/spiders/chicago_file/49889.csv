Smoque BBQ////All in all, I think they do a good job and will likely get better with time. A legendary pit master in Omaha, Jerry, one of the owner's of Fojay's Pit Bar-B-Que, once told me that most smokers don't develop character until you've used them for a few years. I know I'll keep on checking out Smoque, because it is by far the best I've had in Chicago.
