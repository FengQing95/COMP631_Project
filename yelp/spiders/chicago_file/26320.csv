Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Wanted to like this pizza real bad. The staff was nice and seated us quickly. The wings are possibly the best I've had anywhere. The pizza just was not good. We got the original and it was just bland. The sauce was bland, the crust was bland. I could definitely do better in my own kitchen, and I'm. Or really a cook. I thought about giving 4 stars for the service and the wings, but when it comes down to it it's all about the pizza here, and this just didn't make the cut. Sorry, Lou.
