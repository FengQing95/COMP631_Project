Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Fine Chicago deep dish in a very crowded place. I am always amazed at how each Lou Malnati's serve so many people so fast and well. I almost always have the same cheese, onions and spinach medium deep dish with butter crust. The butter seems to make the crust crustier and taste smoother.
