Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Chicago is known for it's pizza and this is obviously a place for Chicagoan's.  I'm originally from the south, it would take some getting used to.  My family enjoyed it and there is a popular appetizer we ordered (sorry I forgot what it was) that was truly excellent...IMO, better than the pizza.  Overall if my family enjoyed it, then I'm satisfied.  What are Moms for?  :)
