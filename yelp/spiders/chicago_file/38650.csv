Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Let me start off by saying all of the bread was absolutely amazing. We started with the garlic Shrimp De Jonghe with Texas style toast. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the garlic butter sauce was to die for. We used every bit of the Texas style toast so soak up that sauce. Next we had the bone marrow and smoked trout Cesar salad. The bone barrow was a very generous portion and was delicious with the bread and jam that accompanied it. The salad was just great as well. Now these were just our appetizers.
