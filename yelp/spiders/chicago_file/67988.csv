Little Goat Diner////-Fried Chicken: Strangely enough, the fried chicken smelled and tasted like an old refrigerator. I know that sounds harsh, but I'm not trying to be. The chicken literally had the stale-stinky-sweet smell of an industrial refrigerator. The breading wasn't properly seasoned and thus, lacked the hallmark buttery-fatty flavor of real, southern-style fried chicken. The breading also fell off the meat of the chicken a little too easily. The mashed potatoes that came on the side were excellent, however.
