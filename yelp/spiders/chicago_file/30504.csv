Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had ordered two small pizza pies - The Malnati Chicago Classic $15.95 (Lou's lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust), and The "Lou" $17.95 (Spinach mix, mushrooms and sliced roma tomatoes covered with blend of mozzarella, romano and cheddar cheese on garlic Buttercrust), both well done.
