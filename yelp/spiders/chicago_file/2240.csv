The Purple Pig////You know when you enter a place and the line is packed inside and out that you're going to experience something amazing! Well this tapas place was one of the most amazing experiences I've ever had. Needless to say everything tasted fresh and every plate made was beautiful! I decided to try the Grilled Octopus, Seafood Saganaki, Jamon dish and Â the chilled calamari! Every single one of these dishes were flavorful, tasty and just outright amazing! I also want to say the Grilled Octopus's was out of this world! Perfectly made, tender and just outright tasty!
