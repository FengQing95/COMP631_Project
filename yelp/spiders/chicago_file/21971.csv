Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The crust, oh the crust. I have been a Giordanos regular on my sporadic visits to the Chicago area. But upon recommendations from locals decided to give it a try. It was amazing. I loved "The Lou"! The only negative is my 18 year old niece prefers ham and bacon and Lou's offers neither. So check the topping choices if that is a concern for anyone in your party.
