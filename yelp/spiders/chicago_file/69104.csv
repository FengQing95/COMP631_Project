Little Goat Diner////When we wanted our pannycakes boxed up, they got thrown away. So the manager asked us to wait a few minutes for a new order.... we did. And took them home. And put them in the fridge. And there they sat. In hindsight, we shouldn't have agreed to the second batch because I doubt we'll eat them. Wasted delicious cakes from batter.
