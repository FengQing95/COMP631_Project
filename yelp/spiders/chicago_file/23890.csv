Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We got seated right away for a party of 2 during the mid afternoon. We ordered the spinach stuffed bread with cheese and marinara sauce and the Lou Malnati Chicago Classic: sausage, cheese(lots of it), and a yummy buttery crust. Both of our choices were so tasty we had no room left for dessert. Ordered the small which serves 2. Each pizza slice was the size of my face and I wish I could have taken some home back with me!
