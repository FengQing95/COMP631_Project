Little Goat Diner////Once you get seated, have a 'upscale diner' atmosphere.  Coffee is rich and distinctive.  Staff is very friendly and attentive.  Prices are very reasonable for this trendy block.  Brunch for two can be had for less than $35 all in.  Lots of fun and creative things to try on the menu.
