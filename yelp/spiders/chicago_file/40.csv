Au Cheval////I loved this place. We had some guests last week and we decided to try out the place. I must say, the food was super rich and heavy but we still loved it. The beer selection was awesome and our server was knowledgeable and friendly even though it was so busy. She took the time to talk to us about a lot of our choices. She warned us we ordered too many starters but we really wanted to try a lot of stuff. There were 4 of us. We ordered the bone marrow, the foie gras terrine, and the chopped chicken liver to start. They were so good we had to clean all the plates. It's no wonder we took home half of each entree! The burger was seriously the best I have had in a long time, even as full as I was. I am not sure why some yelpers didn't like it?! I am a big fan of Kuma's, but they don't even come close to the precision of the burger at Au Cheval. Get in here quick and go early, or you'll have to wait. 4 stars only because there was not much variation from heavy food on the menu, other then that this place was really 5 stars for a "diner."
