Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Overrated I'd say.  We'd seen this place listed as one of the top Chicago style pizzas in Chicago.  So we waited the 90 minutes for a table our first night in Chicago and ordered a couple pizzas from the extremely uninspiring waitress.  We were expecting great things and were disappointed.  Not as good as a Chicago style from Paxti's or Little Star in SF, 2,000 miles away from Chicago.
