Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is a decent casual spot for tapas and sangria. We had a pretty good sampling of the menu and most items were very good, however the paella was disappointing as it was dry and not tasty at all. We have to give the restaurant credit as they took the paella of our bill without our asking. I would recommend this as a good stop if you are out with friends.
