Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I thought the pizza was ok. Or maybe I'm just not a big fan of deep dish pizza because it's way too cheesy for me. The sausage is not the usual small pieces you get at your regular pizza places but large, slices of sausage. I'm not usually a fan of sausage, but their blend of sausage and seasoning sure makes this kind pretty tasty. You really do get your bang for your buck here.
