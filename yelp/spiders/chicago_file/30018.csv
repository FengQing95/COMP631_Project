Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We showed up on a Monday around 2:30pm, hardly a peak time, and it was still busy. There's both indoor and covered outdoor seating. We were seated in the dining room in the back where there are booths and tables. They've tried to cram as many people in this space as (un)comfortably possible. It was such a tight fit that servers were constantly brushing up against us throughout the duration of our meal. When we first sat down, one of the servers accidentally painfully poked my friend in the arm with a pen. SMH.
