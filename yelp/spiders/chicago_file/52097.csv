Smoque BBQ////I have heard so many great things about this place and I was so excited to finally try it out.    The line looked short from the door so we jumped on it.   There was a bit of a line inside but that gave us time to decide what we were going to order.  We wanted to try a lot of different things so we split ribs, brisket, fries, mac and cheese and peach cobbler.   The gem of the meal was definitely the brisket.  YUM!   You muct try it!   It was near perfection.  The ribs were excellent!   The fries were delicious, mac and cheese was not special and peach cobbler was a nice way to round out the meal.  We will be back to Smoque definitely.    Next though, we will call ahead for pick up.
