Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The bacon and dates thing was great, and I don't usually like bacon. Goat cheese and tomato sauce bread was good, as was the octopus (but I think Ibericho's octopus is superior, even though Ba-Ba-Reeba is better overall). The only thing I didn't like was the chicken paella. The last time I had paella was in Costa Rica and it was divine. This one tasted burnt, but not in a good way. The chicken was on the dry side, so I knocked off a star for that.
