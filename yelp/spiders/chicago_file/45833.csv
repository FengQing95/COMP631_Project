Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been coming here since it opened and have never had a bad meal.  As a matter of fact have had some outstanding and definitely good meals here. And I've had alot of fun too.  And a lot of Sangria.  This was a tapas bar before tapas became trendy and they seem to have used the Lettuce formula for success here too, great food and decent prices in a fun atmosphere.
