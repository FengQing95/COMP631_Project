Little Goat Diner////I know most people come here for brunch, but their dinner is equally good. My guy was craving something wholesome and we ended up coming here on a Thursday night around 6:30pm. There was no wait for the counter. The food here reminds me of a up-scale diner with unique combo of choices!
