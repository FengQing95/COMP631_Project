Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The Lou malnati butter crust is really thin, and it provides this nice flaky texture component to the deep dish pie and it has a touch of what butter tastes like but its not heavy, its light. I ended up eating the whole small pizza by myself....even though its suppose to feed like 3 people HAHA. If you're visiting chicago like me for the first time, come here. Try it and i'm sure it'll be well worth trying. Simplicity at its best.
