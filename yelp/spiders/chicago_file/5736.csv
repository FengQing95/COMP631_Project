The Purple Pig////Food wise, we got the meatball special, which had three types of meat (wagyu, veal, and I forget), duck prosciutto, bone marrow, and their hot dog. I personally have never had marrow before this, and wasn't super impressed with it. It honestly is just fat that makes delicious food more delicious. Like it came with some garlic toast, cilantro salad, and salt. I could have just eaten the bread and salad with salt by itself and been happy. So I won't comment on the marrow. The hotdog was easily my favorite though. This could and should really be a one person entree. It's a full hot dog and literally smashed roasted potatoes. But the hotdog came with a sweet mustard topping with pickled green strawberries, and each ingredient brought something different. Warm sweetness from the mustard, picked sweetness from the strawberries, salty meatiness from the hotdog, and a super soft bun made for an amazing experience. Easily my favorite of the night. The duck prosciutto was also new to me. The depth of this meat was ridiculous. It first hits with that familiar fatty duck flavor, but then keeps going with a very very deep ummami flavor. So hard to describe, you just need to experience. The meatballs were good. They were soft and paired with their whipped cheese and salad was good. But no where near the other two.
