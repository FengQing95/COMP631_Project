Art Institute of Chicago////However, I will mention that I was utterly unimpressed by solo exhibition by Cy Twombly Â that is currently featured on the first floor - I fail to see any technical skill or interesting concept in his work. Obviously some would disagree. But at least it's better than the Jeff Koons exhibit that the MCA mounted a year ago.
