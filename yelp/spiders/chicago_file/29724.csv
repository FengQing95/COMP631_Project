Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've tired a few of Chicago's famous deep dish pizza spots and this my favorite. The salad left something to be desired, but I didn't really come for the greens. I ordered a deep dish pizza with sausage and pepperoni. It came out in about 45 minutes and was absolutely delicious. The cheese was perfectly melted, the sausage wasn't too spicy and the sauce tasted very fresh. This is my new go to deep dish pizzeria.
