Smoque BBQ////Halfway through the meal I was preparing this yelp review, and realized that there was one thing that would hold Smoque away from a 5 star review: the sauce. This being a Chicago establishment, it was no surprise that the sauce was too thick and saccharine, as my fellow natives have an inexplicable penchant for cloying, barely-more-than-ketchup barbecue sauces. Still, I could not forgive this very average sauce; I wanted a sauce that packed more vinegar punch, with less tomato and a heck of a lot more heat. A fellow patron overheard my gripe, and informed me that they carried a spicy sauce in addition to the regular offering; I immediately went to the counter and picked up a sauce that (surprise) packed more vinegar punch, with less tomato, and a heck of a lot more heat. There went my lone complaint. I guess I could take off a star because the woman who took my order forgot to ask me if I wanted mild or spicy, but this meal left me in such a state of ecstasy that I'd feel like a scrooge if I did so.
