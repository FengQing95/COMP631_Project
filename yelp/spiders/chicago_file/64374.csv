Smoque BBQ////This place is the spot to go. My bf and I come here at least once a week, and it is never a disappointment! He orders the pull pork sandwich and the sliced brisket sandwich, while I order the sliced brisket sandwich. It is by far the best I have ever had. The meat is very juicy, tender, and has a little fat which I don't mind. It is a bit small, and the patio seems to fill up quickly, wish they could expand just a little bit more. The staff is really friendly and always seem to be on top of everything. You guys do an awesome job! I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good brisket and pull pork sandwiches. Don't forget to ask for the fries!
