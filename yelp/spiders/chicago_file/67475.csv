Little Goat Diner////I'm hoping that when I return there for lunch that I will be able to add another star or two to my review.  The restaurant is a great space--open and roomy with lots of light streaming in and the staff are all very nice and helpful.  We went there for breakfast and were struck by the unusual combination of ingredients they use in their entrees like the one with spaghetti, egg and kimchi.  I'm somewhat of a foodie and pretty adventurous and I've had lots of experiences in restaurant where I'd see something on the menu and wonder how those things all went together, order the dish anyway, and love it.  This was not the case this time.  Everything tasted great at first bite but there were just too many combinations of foods and spices going on and we didn't even eat half our meals. My stomach is still doing flip flops 6 hrs later..not because the food was bad ( it was fresh and excellen0t, but because it just did not agree with me.  I did eyeball the lunch entrees and the desserts and that is why I plan to come back. I think the chef's adventurousness would work better with non egg entrees.  We ordered smoked french fries with out breakfast which were some of the best fries I ever tasted.  Those fries are going to bring me back to this restaurant for another try but I will take a pass on breakfast!
