Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My mom and I ordered the Spinach Salad, the Stuffed Spinach Bread, and a small Malnati Chicago classic pizza. The spinach salad was pretty average, but I was still happy that we got a salad because the rest of our meal was so carby. It was nice to be able to eat something while waiting for the ~grand finale~. Nevertheless, our appetizer, the stuffed spinach bread, was delicious. It was kind of like it's own extra mini deep dish pizza with marinara sauce on the size, and I definitely recommend it if you aren't planning to eat an entire pizza!
