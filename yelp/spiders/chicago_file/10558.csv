Art Institute of Chicago////Amazing art Museum. Technically it is the second largest in the country. There is so much to see here. Consider making it a two day event. The coffee place inside is reasonable as well. Once you have a ticket you can go out and come back in as well same day. The employees are very helpful as well!
