Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were recommended Lou's in our obligatory deep dish search and it did not disappoint! We started off with the bruschetta which was awesome!!!! Perfect toast - not too hard that the crunch makes everything fall off. It was a cross with a garlic bread bottom in a sense, but all freshly made and definitely recommend. Got the butter crust deep dish cheese. It's a 45 minute wait, but after reading all the other reviews and the bruschetta, we knew it would be worth the trip. It was quite good, but don't have anything to compare it to.
