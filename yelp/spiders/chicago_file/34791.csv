Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food was excellent, as were the drinks. But I think the staff put this pace over the top. Our server was a hilarious high energy character, like Charlie Day without the annoying voice. He seemed to have a pretty good banter with his assistant. They were great with the food and drink recommendations and even comped us a sazerac. I would highly recommend this place and try to get a table with the waiter whose name we don't remember. But you'll know who I'm talking about if he serves you.
