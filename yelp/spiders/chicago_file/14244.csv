Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It was my first time in Chicago and I was on the prowl for their famous deep dish pizza.  Went to this place the first day and I got their Classic.  Fantastic!  I went to Giordano's a few days later to compare, and it did not.  I went to Lou's again as I craved it the next 3 days during my stay.  Wonderful crust and texture of cheese!  I smuggled half of a pizza onto my plane and have one slice left in my fridge that I am rationing.  Don't judge me!
