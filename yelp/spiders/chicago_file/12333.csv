Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute of Chicago is a must visit for anyone visiting the city and locals who haven't been there in awhile. It's huge! And there is something interesting for everyone's taste in Art, from famous classical painters to old ancient sculptures to ultra modern art. There's even a small diorama exhibit in the basement that is incredible.
