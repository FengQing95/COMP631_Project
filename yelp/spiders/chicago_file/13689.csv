Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our friend joined us and the three of us were having such a great time talking and hanging out with Rob that we stayed for a couple more drinks before heading out. Â The food was amazing!!! And Rob was one of the best servers and bartenders I've had in awhile (I've been a waitress for 15 years so I'm very picky when I say this)!!!
