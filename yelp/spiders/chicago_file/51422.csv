Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is my ALL TIME FAVORITE restaurant. The sangria is so delicious as well as the food. It does however get pretty busy in the evening times so be sure to make a reservation or else you will wait a while. Â I don't mind waiting because it is always worth it. When you go order the spicy potatoes those little things are amazing and spicy.
