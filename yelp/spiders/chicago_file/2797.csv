The Purple Pig////This is a true 5 star. It's vibrant and energetic. The hosts do a good job of explaining how the menu is meant to be shared and take any time needed to help answer questions. This makes an experience. We started with the nduja salt roasted beets. Both done very well. The cheese bread was particularly delicious. We then shared the Waugh Bavette steak. It can be a chewy piece. This was grilled perfectly and melted in my mouth. The desserts looked amazing but we were too full. We'll be back, late night to try those
