Little Goat Diner////Among the best brunches I've ever had. Their bullseye French toast is a tastefully combined assortment of a few things I love: Toad in the hole and chicken & waffles. The addition of strawberries balances out the salt from the chicken and maple syrup absorbs all the flavors once the yolk is cracked into. The pork fat and toffee crumble shake is a very interesting milkshake that brought baconny flavor into my dessert - a little different, but worth a try. Great service and a nice ambience made this a great place to bring my sister for her birthday. Coming back for sure.
