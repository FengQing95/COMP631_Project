The Purple Pig////(which they were, our fault,) the neckbone gravy which was really good, the milk braised pork shoulder which was awesome, and the serrano ham on grilled bread and a duck egg which was the ultimate disappointment. I have never eaten such a salty dish in my life. And it wasn't the ham, it was the seemingly fistful of rocksalt sprinkled over the egg. I couldn't eat it and my girlfriend, who's kind of picky and took forever for me to convince to try a duck egg beforehand, looked at me like I was crazy.
