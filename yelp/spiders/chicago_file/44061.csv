Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Holy people, Batman! This places gets BUSY for dinner. We have ordered almost every tapa on the menu plus the paella. The octopus is overcooked and chewy. The fillet with blue cheese was rare and mmmm good. The chicken curry salad was good. Almost everything was good. The sangria flavors are also good, my favorite was peach.
