Little Goat Diner////Very cute place. I do plan on coming back despite my mediocre rating. I give Little Goat 3 stars based on the dish I had for breakfast today- the everything is everything crumpets with lox. It was overbearingly SALTY. I could hardly finish it. But I think that there was SO much potential.
