Art Institute of Chicago////For a twist, this review is for their cafe.  They have a great selection and everything looked delicious.  Had roasted chicken, asparagus, and sweet potato.  The chicken was moist, the roasted asparagus was cooked the prefect amount,  and the roasted sweet potato was soft and sweet.
