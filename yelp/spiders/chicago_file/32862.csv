Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place is all ambience mixed with phenomenal food. It's like stepping into a time machine back to the roaring 20s! You don't mind the wait thanks to the bar and cocktails that result. You can't go wrong on the menu: seafood is the house specialty but the beef will make you question that distinction.
