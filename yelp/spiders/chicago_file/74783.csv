Little Goat Diner////I went here with a large party for a birthday lunch and while there was a 100% approval rating from my co-workers on the food, I did notice quite a lot of disparity in the size of the food portions. Everyone received a greater portion than you could typically expect on Randolph Street, but we were all served at the same time, and yet by the time we decided to get the check, some of us had finished cleaning our plates over 20 minutes earlier and some people only managed to get about halfway through their sandwiches. In order to get the most out of your Little Goat experience (and not leave craving something from BomboBar across the street) you probably need to do a little research.
