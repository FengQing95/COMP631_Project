Smoque BBQ////Best BBQ in Chicago...and realy one of the best in the country.  I have been to BBQ joints throughout the U.S. (St. L, KC, Texas, and more) and this ranks up there with the best of them.  Their brisket is incredible, memphis-style BBQ sauces are great, and the sides are tops too.  I reccomend for sides the Mac & cheese and french fries as two of the best.  Always be prepared to wait as the lines are always very long for this great BBQ.  You wait in line to order and get a table shortly after ordering and then the food is ready not long after that- the wait is the wait to order which they space out nicely.
