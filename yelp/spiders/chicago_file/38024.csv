Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We were seated at our table and we were offered the most perfect sourdough fluffy cloud bread I have ever eaten. It comes out fresh and warm and I wanted it to be my whole meal, but okay we're at Bavette's so I didn't want to load up. Our waiter was awesome/patient with us because the menu is large and everything looks good, so there was much debate on how we wanted to course things out. We decided on: baked goat cheese (MUST GET!! Seriously, so amazing), wedge salad (bacon steaks), 22 oz. ribeye (we split), wild mushrooms (amazing) and of course, my favorite, FRITES and garlic aioli. Garlic aioli is one of my biggest weaknesses other than freshly baked Bavette's sourdough bread and puppies.
