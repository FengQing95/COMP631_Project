Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here a few weeks ago for an impromptu girls night and had a really good experience. It was crowded on a Saturday night--not in a bad way, but in a "this place is tasty and popular" way. We enjoyed the black raspberry sangria to start out with and, even though it was busy, were not rushed to order by our server. Got some great recommendations for both vegetarian and meat dishes, and away we went. For three people I think we ended up with 6 dishes and two desserts. Highlights were stuffed mushroom caps and the goat cheese in tomato sauce, and of course the dessert flan. I definitely recommend this restaurant, just make sure you get a reservation ahead of time!
