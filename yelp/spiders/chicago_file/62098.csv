Smoque BBQ////When I arrived with an empty stomach, but the line out the door stood in my way, I waited like a trooper and took it in stride. "Lines mean it's a great place," I reassured myself. When I was met by an eerily robotic cashier that took my order, I brushed it off as efficiency at work. When I scanned my surroundings and took note of at the limited seating and the forgettable d√©cor, I was able to push that aside. I promised myself it was because they care about food and not paint swatches.
