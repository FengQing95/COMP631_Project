Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great first experience with authentic Chicago deep dish pizza. My goal was to visit Lou Malnati's,along with two other places during my visit. The first, and favorite stop during the weekend, was Lou Malnati's. The crust was the stand out on this pizza, and wasn't as heavy as I anticipated. Would definitely return
