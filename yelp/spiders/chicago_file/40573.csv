Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The other thing that made this experience so great is the vibe of the patrons, everyone was friendly, the music was perfect for the setting (jazz), the lighting was dim but not too dim, the brick walls, which were so pretty, the "stuff" on the walls weren't too much, everything was just on point.
