The Purple Pig////We settled on the duck with yogurt and salmon roe for our dinner. I get duck everywhere I can. I would eat duck for my last meal on earth (or filet mignon, seriously check my profile). If it was socially acceptable I would eat duck for every meal. But THIS duck? What just happened? The salmon roe? Hold on a sec...yogurt? On a bun? Am I on camera?
