Smoque BBQ////Oh my god.  Everything we had here was outstanding.  We had the pulled pork, which was moist and tender and served on a perfect roll, as well as a taste of ribs, cornbread, fries and beans - all delicious.  There was a line out the door and we waited about 30 mins to order our food but it was well worth it.  Staff was friendly and accommodating.
