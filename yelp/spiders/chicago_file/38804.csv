Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Once the food begins to arrive, there's just no stopping it. I've clearly overdone it. But let me tell you the mac & cheese is some of the creamiest I've ever eaten, the pasta is cooked perfectly. The potato was the size of a small child, seriously this thing was enormous and, indeed, loaded. The brussel sprouts were a welcome green addition to this hearty heart attack starter. The ribeye, oh my! We shared it as our server had warned us early on we'd overloaded. Boy, was she spot on.  The candied bacon? I'll never be the same--epic.
