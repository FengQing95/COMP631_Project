Art Institute of Chicago////Like the Met, they have art from all over the world throughout history. The American and European sections appeared to be the largest, with a lot of paintings. However, there are still sections dedicated to Asian art, Native American, African, ancient Egypt, ancient Greek and more. We spotted a few famous pieces too, like "American Gothic" and "Nighthawks". This place is definitely a must see for art lovers in Chicago.
