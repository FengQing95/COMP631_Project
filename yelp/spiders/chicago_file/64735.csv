Smoque BBQ////I must this place is pretty good! I wish the expand more because this venue is so small to serve all the hungry customers that want to check this place out or come back for some more. The wait is really long but worth the try. I waited 30 min for a table when I was hungry maybe I should have been warned to come in before I start getting super hungry. Everything was good and I will definitely come back for some more!
