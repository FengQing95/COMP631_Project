Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I can't believe that the delivery person, knowing they were delivering to a hotel, would not bring utensils and condiments. When I asked, she said "Oh, the hotel has that." and left. Of course I called the location, there is little or nothing they can do. I am disappointed, because my last experience with Lou's was awesome. Also a delivery, but that person had it together.
