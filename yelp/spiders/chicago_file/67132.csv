Little Goat Diner////Server was pleasant and did her best to make a suggestion when I asked for a seafood plate.  $18.00 Boo Boo Baise was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.  Flavorless and SO SALTY it felt like salt lick after salt lick with each bite.  I couldn't finish it.  I expected much better from Stephanie Izard.
