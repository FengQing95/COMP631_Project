Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food here is flat out fantastic. I've had some the finest meals of my life at this fine establishment. Want the perfect meal? Start with the exquisite garlic shrimp de jonghe, select a petite filet minion as your main course and finish with the lemon meringue pie. I also recommend the mashed potatoes, but each order serves 7-8. I was visiting from out of town and I was heartbroken to have leave the leftovers behind. Oh, and the service is delightful and mature. Grown ups who care about great food and thoughtful service work here.
