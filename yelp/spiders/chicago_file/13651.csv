Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////A decent place for deep dish pizza in downtown chicity. I've been here twice, and each time have had a good experience. The service was spot on, and the pizzas came out in the regular 30-45 minute timeframe. The pizza is loaded with cheese, and there is tons of sausage. However, I was a bit disappointed with the amount of sauce. I went through many a bite with only tasting meat and cheese...which while I love me some of that, I also want some sauce. Next time when I'm in Chicago, I'm going to try somewhere else. The pizza was good, but with so many other options in town, it's time to move on and try somewhere new!
