Smoque BBQ////The ribs had a nice thick coat of rub and were smoked to nearly perftection. Tender but not falling off the bone - always a giveaway that they've been parboiled or baked in advance of the grill.   The pulled pork was very good, and the chicken was equally as good.  Go for a combo plate and you can help but come out with a great meal.
