Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place is large and one of the top tourist spots to get some deep dish. I came here with a group of 8 and enjoyed their pizza. We got a veggie pizza and the classic with sausage. I actually liked the veggie one over the sausage. The veggie pizza had more flavor and taste, and the sausage was a tad dry.
