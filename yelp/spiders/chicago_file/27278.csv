Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'be eaten quite a bit of this pizza in the past five years. This pizza is a magnificent thing but the crust loses a little of its gastronomic super power as soon as it's sitting Â on cardboard instead of the hot, gritty steel pan in which it's served at LM's. If you're going to invest in such expensive pizza, I recommend dining in. Enjoy!
