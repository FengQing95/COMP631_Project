Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Service: The hosts were friendly and conversant, our waiter was attentive, apologetic when dessert took a little longer than anticipated, and checked in on us the perfect amount. They also brought out our dessert with a sparkler since we were celebrating. We were well taken care of from the moment we walked through the door.
