Art Institute of Chicago////I made a mad dash to Chicago during my trip to Madison, Wisconsin. Headed over to the Bean and noticed that the Institute was having the Manet Exhibit... Impressionism is my favorite artwork so I ran eagerly up the steps only to find that they were closing in 30 minutes and I wouldn't be able to do see the display. Please note you must buy tickets in advance and if you show up with 30 minutes to spare they will not allow you to begin. The structure was going through renovations but it was still breathtaking to behold and the gardens around it were complimentary to the city and the Lake it sits upon.
