Art Institute of Chicago////What my boyfriend and I were able to see during our one day visit was just WOW. There's just something about viewing pieces from 300 B.C. that takes your breath away. How can anything last that long and still look beautiful? Anyway, I know I can go on about how cool, pretty, eclectic, and thought-provoking a lot of the pieces were, but you honestly have to see it for yourself.
