Art Institute of Chicago////We had about 4 hours to kill so decided to stop by the Art Institute because it was near our hotel. Once there, we discovered it housed many famous and impressive works, most notably American Gothic. As a whole the museum is extremely well curated, displayed, organized. Although we were speeding through, we were about to pause at stuff we were interested without feeling like we were missing out on anything. It would be more educational to scrutinize every piece but really, art is about what grabs you and makes an impression. The most surprising interesting galleries? The miniature rooms and the cultural art of the Americas.
