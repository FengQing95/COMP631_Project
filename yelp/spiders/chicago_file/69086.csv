Little Goat Diner////I can't say a bad thing about anything on the menu. Also it has the best chill diner feel of anywhere. Roofdeck is the most on point roof deck in this city. Its complete lack of pretension while delivering high quality foods is the most desireable and attractive trait and lures me back again and again. Do a milkshake. Absolutely get the bread. Go for brunch. Go for drinks. Go for lunch, five times in a summer. Go with out-of-town guests. Go with foodies. Go with Midwestern, decidedly non-foodie parents. It's so versatile and such a gem in this city.
