Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I'm going to start by saying this place is amazing.  The waiter was very helpful by giving us great recommendations. We tried the six types of pinxos and I have to say that the tuna pinxo is out of this world.  We also tried a few appetizers and I must say that the gambas al ajillo  is the best shrimp I've ever had. If you try it, don't forget to dip bread in the oily juices that come with the shrimp. It is extraordinary fabulous.
