Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tapas, galore!! I needed 30 minutes to try and choose what I wanted to order and even then had a hard time narrowing it down. We had a party of 6 with each person ordering 2-3 dishes so a TON of food. I got to try most of it and everything (besides the empanada I ordered- blah) I tasted was absolutely delicious and unlike any other food I have ever had. I especially loved the deviled eggs, stuffed mushrooms and garlic shrimp. Loved the diversity and uniqueness of Â this place.
