Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It's my day off and I decided to dine in a fine restaurant for dinner and go to Bavette's Bar and Boeut. The place is a bit dark romantic which is such a nice ambiance. There were a lot of couples and I am all alone but it was okay. The waiter is dressed beautifully, nice and very professional. While I was waiting for my food I eat their complementary bread a sourdough that tastes really good. I had their oyster first and then I had the dry aged ribeye which is cooked perfectly, it is so tender and flavorful. I had mac and cheese for sides that is also  delicious. However, the cocktail I had taste just like the average cocktail but still perfect to end my meal. I had a great time dining in here. The food and service is  amazing but I must say that the price is really expensive, overall it was worth it.
