Smoque BBQ////One of my besties recommended this place to me. She actually tries to go here as many times as possible in a week, so I knew something was up. I was wow'd. The barbecue brisket was so tender, the pulled pork sandwiches were super moist, and the mac n cheese??! That totally sealed the deal for me. I didn't run into a long line when I went so I was pretty lucky. I hear the lines get really long!
