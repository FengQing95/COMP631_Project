Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Being from San Diego, pizza like this doesn't exist. From what I have gathered, there is 3 big players of pizza in Chicago, Lou Malnati's, Gino's east, and Giordano's pizza. Or these are the famous ones that everyone talks about at least. So far, I've eaten at two, Lou's and Giordano's. Lines were never an issue as my trip was in January and I would either eat early or late. So I had two things working in my favor, time and season.
