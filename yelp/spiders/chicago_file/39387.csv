Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Came in on a Friday without a reservation so I got there just after they opened. Â I was able to grab a space at the bar in the Parlor with no problem. And so glad I did becuase Aylecia (sp?) Took such great care of us. She is an awesome bartender and made the evening special for us. The Lions Tail is an excellent cocktail if you are looking for a Bourbon drink. Also had filet and the cheeseburger with brussel sprouts, elote style corn amd fries. Everything was absolutely delicious and I can't wait to go back again!
