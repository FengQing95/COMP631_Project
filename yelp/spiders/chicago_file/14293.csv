Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you are going on a trip to Chicago, you need to try some deep dish Pizza.  Much different from our thin crust in NY, this pizza takes a full 45 minutes to cook.  The place to go for this is not Pizzeria Uno (which originated in Chicago), but Lou Malnati's.  Started in 1971, this family owned and operated chain is now 33 Restaurants strong.  The location Carol and I frequent when we go to Chicago is The River North Location on North Wells Street.
