Little Goat Diner////We came here on a whim. I tried numerous times to get reservations at Girl and The Goat for my mom's visit and failed, so when my friend suggested we go here for brunch I practically laughed at her. But low and behold, we got in and only had a 10 minute wait in which we browsed their bakery and marinade section and also watched a strange couple get it on in the photo booth. You know, typical Saturday stuff.
