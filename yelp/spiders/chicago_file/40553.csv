Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We also ordered the Crab Cake which was packed with crab & was super delicious; the Buttery Mashed Potatoes & Creamed Spinach for the sides; & Roasted Bone-Marrow enhancement. Everything was heavenly however a tad bit too salty. The complimentary bread paired well with the drippings from the Bone-Marrow.
