The Purple Pig////Omg. Heard about how good this place is but omg. From the cocktail to the dessert , everything was good. Service was superb too. It was cold out ( single digits) and we waited for about20 min to get a table. But someone promptly came out to take our drink orders and got the drinks and food delivered to us fast. ( they informed us the wait was 45 min but ended up waiting for 20 min lol)
