Little Goat Diner////We ordered the tempura mashed potatoes ($5) and broccoli & cheese puff ($7) for our side dishes and that's when our brunch got super fun. At least for me. Apparently the usual puffs for the broccoli & cheese puff were not yet ready so they plated ours on top of more of a crumpet looking pastry. This was a total win for us because the pastry was so mouthwatering, the super nice manager brought it out to us & said Stephanie apologizes, plus we had it comped from our bill! I can't believe how super nice they were for such a minor change. We were completely okay with this and all enjoyed the pastry part of the puff very much! I preferred the tempura mashed potatoes of our two side dishes. We all agreed it was similar to a croquette except with tempura breading. It was so delicious I can't put it into words!
