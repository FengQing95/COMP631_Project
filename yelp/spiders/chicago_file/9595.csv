Art Institute of Chicago////With the construction of a mighty new Modern Wing, the Art Institute of Chicago places itself right up there with the big boys at the Met, MOMA and Getty, no longer a "Second City" of art presentation. Renzo Piano's interpretation of "zero gravity" presents itself in a beautiful, airy, naturally lit element sure to please even the most discerning eye. Creating an appealing, safe environment to highlight world-class artwork yet consume half the energy of the existing buildings shows how a conservative design can meet the need to reduce power consumption in an ever-increasing demand for public expansion.
