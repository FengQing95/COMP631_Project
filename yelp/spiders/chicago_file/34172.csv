Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////You can get a great steak at a few places in Chicago, but for the sides, and vibe, Bavettes is my new favorite. Don't skip out on Maude's Tower. The price may be high, but becomes way more reasonable with each bite. Â Hat's off to you Mr. Sodikoff for another gem in this great city!
