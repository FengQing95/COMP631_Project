Little Goat Diner////This place was PACKED...fortunately I came alone and was seated at the bar within moments. I ordered "The fat club" but asked for wheat bread and sauces on the side. The sandwich was HUGE and I fully expected leftovers...there weren't any. I ended up pouring the sauces (house sauce was amazing) and devouring my entire meal along with the half order or smoked fries (which actually weren't all that great) Â I would have gone for dessert however prices were steep. My waitress was nice and attentive but overall I thought my meal was too pricey for what it was. I do recommend going at least once though. If I do I will certainly order something else =)
