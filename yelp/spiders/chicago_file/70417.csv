Little Goat Diner////We put our names in and waited the hour to get seated, and brunch was worth the wait. We luckily didn't get seated at the communal table. Our party of 4 was in a comfortable booth. I ordered the spicy ginger ale and it hit the spot. I love the unique flavors and creative dishes. I got the Breakfast Spaghetti 'N Clams 'N Crabs and it was surprised me in a great way. I tasted the other 3 dishes that my girlfriends got and really liked them as well - the Bull's Eye French Toast, the Kimchee & Bacon & Eggs & Pancakes Asian Style Breakfast Tasty Thing, and the Shrimp & Grits. The little goat coffe was pretty good even without the sugar, and that's saying something to me who usually always has coffee with some type of sugar in it. Somehow the goat milk gave the coffee flavor which took on a more complex taste than regular cow's milk. I would love to come back here and try other items on the menu. Our waitress was friendly and helpful with recommendations. The prices are a bit higher, but the unique and creative dishes are worth it!
