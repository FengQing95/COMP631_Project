Art Institute of Chicago////I went to Chicago in the Summer of 2012 to visit family, and absolutely had the time of my life there. One of the highlights of the trip was my experience in the Millenium Park area, where I spent a lot of time. At the behest of several family members, I spent an extremely enjoyable day touring this gem by myself, and really was sad when the day ended.
