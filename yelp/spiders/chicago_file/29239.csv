Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The restaurant has a bunch of appetizer options such as cheesy garlic bread, wings, etc but we just wanted to stuff ourselves with pizza. We ordered the Lou (the veggie friendly one) and the original Malanati Chicago classic which included sausage, cheese, and tomato sauce. Service was definitely rushed and waiters seemed overwhelmed but we were able to order our pizza and get it within the hour. It was a very flavorful pizza that was definitely worth the money (around $12 each).
