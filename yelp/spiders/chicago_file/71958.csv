Little Goat Diner////Really great brunch spot! I came here the other day with a group of friends and they were very accommodating to us even though we didn't make a reservation. The food is pretty straight forward but well made and delicious. They have a great bar that seems nice to just chill at if you are not in a group. Try their Bloody Mary for sure it's really good. Nothing was over the top exceptional but I do like this place and will be back for sure.
