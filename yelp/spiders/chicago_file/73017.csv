Little Goat Diner////The staff at the host/hostess stand was a little snoody in my opinion, but the waitress was excellent. Our party enjoyed nachos, crab dip, the korean burger, the grilled cheese, the garlic bread, the smoked fries, and finished it all off with some fresh spun milkshakes. High quality ingredients and the food came out ULTRA fast. Waitress was very quick and helpful with a slight food error and made sure to fully rectify the situation. Very happy we tried this one!
