Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This used to be my favorite restaurant in Chicago. I have been here over 5 times, including for many special occasions, and have always had a wonderful experience. That changed yesterday. It started with the hostess, who was either having a bad day or was just an unpleasant person. I was the first of my party to arrive, one minute before our reservation, and the hostess, without even offering a welcome, quickly informed me that our table would be given away if everyone wasn't here in 15 minutes (I think it's hilarious that they have this policy considering ever time I've eaten here I've had to wait 10-15 minutes for my reserved table). No acknowledgement that we were celebrating a birthday.  I asked if it was sufficient to have 3 of the 4 present while the fourth person parked the car and she deadpanned, "We may be able to accommodate that." Ok, thanks lady. Really appreciate the clarity. I understand you have to keep everything on time or it can screw up the night, but how about informing me of that with a little less contempt?
