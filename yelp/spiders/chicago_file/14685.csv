Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had them deliver it to our hotel and it arrived at the time requested. It was almost perfect except we would've liked a side of cheese for the pasta and a side of dressing for both salads. I couldn't believe feeding 11 people with delivery and tip was under $180! We even had pizza leftover for us! Our guests enjoyed having a variety of choices as we showed them the menu beforehand so they could choose exactly what they wanted. Being a small wedding I didn't want to have a set menu. Thank you River-North!
