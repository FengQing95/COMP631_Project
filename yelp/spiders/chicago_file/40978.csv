Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////okay, so i confess---i really like cafe ba bar reeba's food.  i do not like how loud and crowded the place is, but i like the food.  i recently admitted this to the people i work with at a high-end catering company (okay fine, so they probably know a little about good food) and i was totally verbally abused for my secret love of ba ba reeba.  so apparently, there are other way better tapas places in the city (probably true).  my favorite things to eat a ba ba reeba would definitely include the goat cheese and tomato thingy on garlic bread, the bacon-wrapped dates (but what wouldn't taste good wrapped in bacon), stuffed mushrooms, and the spicy potatoes.  i think it's best to go there on a week night or for lunch, though, to avoid the crowd.
