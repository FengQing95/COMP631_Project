Smoque BBQ////The food is absolutely delicious!  I'm a bit of a BBQ snob, but this place was the best I've ever had outside of Texas.  We had a party of 8 at approx. 6:30pm on a Sunday night.  There was a line outside the door when the first half of our group arrived.  The staff was so friendly and helpful, they managed to accomodate our entire party and even got a kick out of us setting the table (it's BYOB, which to my friend's mom also means bring your own table cloth, placemats, candles, and glasses).  I will definitely be going back.
