Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've had numerous deep dish pizzas in California and honestly, I don't really see the big deal with Lou Malnati's. I can name a few in California that are far superior in taste and quality (Little Star Pizza or Zachary's in the Bay Area; Masa of Echo Park in LA) -- Lou Malnati's "butter" crust actually tasted pretty bland to me.
