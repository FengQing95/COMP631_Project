Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////One of the most expensive breakfast places in town, but is worth every penny. Everything is quality, and tastes amazing. The location is kinda weird if you don't know what you're looking for. The wait is most definitely worth it, and they do have a mini coffee shop to grab a drink if you can't stay for breakfast.
