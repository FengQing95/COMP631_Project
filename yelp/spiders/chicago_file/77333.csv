Little Goat Diner////This is probably one of my top 5 places to eat in Chicago. The place is small but cozy and fun! Visited there a couple of times with friends and we loved it. The waitstaff is very helpful. The food is downright amazing!! My absolute favorite goat chili cheese fries and the sloppy goat. So so good!
