Smoque BBQ////Smoque, in my opinion, is one of the best BBQ establishments in the nation.  The balance they achieve between the rub and smoker is hard to beat.  The meat stands alone; sauce is very good (there are two kinds, one peppery, the other vinegary), but not required (and they are stingy with the sauce, too).  Although I order their chopped brisket a little less than half the times I have been there, the ribs are excellent (baby back - I'm a Chicago guy), and the pulled pork is a great sandwich or platter, too.  I have not had the chicken.  The sausage is very good, with some subtle heat to it. The sides are uniformly excellent, although the slaw is not to my taste.  The fries are double fried ala Al's Beef, and very good.  In my close to 20 visits since Smoque has been open, food consistency has been to the same, high standard.
