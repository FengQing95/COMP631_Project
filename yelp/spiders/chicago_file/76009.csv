Little Goat Diner////I'm not exactly sure why this place has this much of a hype that everyone wants to try it really. We had very high expectations when we came since the wait was ridiculous and there was no way we were not going to try it. So we waited and finally got seated after about 45 minutes. Great thing is you can leave your phone number and they'll text you when your table is ready.
