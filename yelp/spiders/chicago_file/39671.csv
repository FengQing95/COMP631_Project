Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////BEST steakhouse in the city! Sexy Parisian decor and exceptional steaks and drinks. Must tries include old fashioned cocktails and violet smashes. In terms of food, the steak tartare, wedge salad and bone marrow are decadent. No matter what the cut, the steaks are cooked to perfection. I enjoy mine medium rare and Bavette's has always delivered. Sides ranging from Brussel sprouts, fries, elotes style corn, and truffle Mac n cheese are fantastic. Be sure to leave room for dessert!!
