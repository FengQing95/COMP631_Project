Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The tapas are YUMMY- I get the beef skewer w/horseradish sauce. It is like a little bite of heaven. The goat cheese marinara is lovely, too. Their spicy potatoes are so yummy as well. Order these with a pitcher of sangria (coming in at least 5 different flavors) and it is the perfect size meal. No overdoing it, no leftovers.
