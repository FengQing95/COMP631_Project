Little Goat Diner////I met for a business lunch at the Little Goat this week.  What a great place!  I had the Tuna Melt and it was out of this world.  Open faced, and topped with fresh greens, this plate was not only tasty, but I didn't walk away feeling like I over ate.  And, yes I did eat the WHOLE THING!  A very bright and open concept environment, I will be back soon!
