Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza takes ~45 min to make which is a small price to pay to eat this pizza. The crust is crisp and buttery and never soggy! How is that possible, you ask? Well there is a layer of cheese and meat (more appetizing than I'm making it sound) between the crust and tomato sauce that keeps that buttery crust so crisp and flakey. The tomatoes they use are freshly canned and the cheese is from Wisco, which is America's dairyland (according to their license plate), so you KNOW it's good.
