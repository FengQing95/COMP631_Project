Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The Malnati Chicago Classic was by far the best decision, this pizza was delicious. My friend and I could not stop talking about this pizza the entire trip. We wanted to go back for seconds but didn't have time. That cheese and crust!!! To die for! I highly recommend this, it's called the Malnati Chicago Classic for a reason!
