Little Goat Diner////We kind of shared both entrees and totally agree on Pork Belly was the excellent choice. Pork was flavorful and not greasy. I have not figured out if the pork was braised, steamed or baked. Anyway it was so tasty with shredded cabbage and crispy noodles. The grilled Scallion pancake was the perfect wrap for those. The very light touch of housin sauce was just right. This should be a perfect oriental dish but I have not seen anything like this at any Asian place I tried. Absolutely delicious.
