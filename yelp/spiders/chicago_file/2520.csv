The Purple Pig////The bf and I stopped in here for some afternoon bar bites before shopping along Michigan. Everything was delish! Four stars because it is a bit of a to-do given its popularity and "cozy" space. You will likely encounter at least a small wait, but between the communal tables and large bar it's nothing drastic. So don't let the constant crowd scare you away from stopping in here!
