Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is usually my favorite spot and where I take out of town guests. Had a 4:30 reservation on Saturday. Service was friendly and we were sat promptly. I was comfortable with the COVID measures as well. I felt that the food quality was lacking. Chicken and Vegetable Paella was over cooked and lacked flavor. The goat cheese and marinara sauce also appeared overcooked and on the dry side. The mango seasonal sangria was delicious.
