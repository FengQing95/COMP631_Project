Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////On this trip, it was just my BFF and me. We shared a pitcher of white (peach?) sangria. I'm not a huge fan of wine chocked full of fruit, but this was a-ok. Feeling like several small items was in order, I started with the plate of cheese and she had the shrimp skewers. She raved about the sauce. I raved about the goat cheese. Our waiter, Jesus, was very fast and friendly. He even encouraged me to use the little bit of spanish I know ("Yo quiero los patatas bravas, por favor"). The rest of the staff was quite friendly as well. BTW, the patatas bravas were to DIE FOR. For those of us who loved Rally's fries, they were like that but bigger and they came with a special dipping sauce. I don't know how I'm even surviving without having had those potatoes since I first tried them, but as soon as I get back to Chicago, I have a date with those potatoes.
