Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The soft, buttery crust.  The thick sauce.  The sauteed mushrooms.  The seasoned Italian sausage. The cheese.  Oh sweet Cheesus... the cheese.  So gooey.  Anyway... I don't live in the city anymore.  I saw one too many episodes of Baywatch and escaped the Winter cold to Cali.  They said it was the place you ought to be.  Swimming pools.  Movie stars.  Yeah.  There's no Lou Malnati's here, though.  They forgot to mention that.  I don't like them very much now.
