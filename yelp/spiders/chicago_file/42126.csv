Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of my favorite places in the city.  Great atmosphere, fun people, and amazing food and drinks tops this place off as my goto spot for either a fun date or a great night out on the town with good friends.  The wait can get long but you can call and make reservations.  I love that they have assorted Sangria flavors on tap.  Every girl I've brought here loves the Sangria (sometimes a little too much)..
