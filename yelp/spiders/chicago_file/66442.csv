Little Goat Diner////Had a delightful Sunday afternoon here!! My friends and I were so excited to try this place out but were really worried about how busy it would be.  We dropped in at around 3 on a Sunday afternoon and hardly had to wait! The space was beautiful: really bright and open (totally different feel than Girl and the Goat).  There was a lively, diverse crowd of people: super casual couples, families and friends.
