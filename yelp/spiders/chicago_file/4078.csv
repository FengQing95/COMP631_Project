The Purple Pig////Fried Chicken Marsala - Another phenomenal dish that sounds mediocre on paper, but is executed perfectly.  I'm not even sure how they accomplished the flavors honestly, but it was a perfectly fried piece of chicken, with dabs of mushroom sauce, and actual mushrooms.  It was seasoned to perfection and was my 2nd favorite item this night.
