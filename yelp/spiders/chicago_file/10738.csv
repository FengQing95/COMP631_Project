Art Institute of Chicago////This museum garners works on loan that locals simply must purchase memberships to see!  Residents ought to earn memberships for volunteerism or community involvement! A waiter tonight has lived here over 20 years and has never been here! I know it's rather naïve of me to think that everyone should crave art as passionately as I do. It has something for everyone. You may quote me to the mayor on this.
