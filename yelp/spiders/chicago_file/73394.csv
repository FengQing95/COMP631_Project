Little Goat Diner////Came here recently. Got the grilled cheese and the halibut special and the tomato soup. Also got the raspberry desert. It was all excellent. And the servers were all very pleasant. Even though a bit loud inside, it was a quite relaxing place. I was very impressed overall with it. Would love to go back again.
