Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Food is really good but I picked off a start because it's a bit over crowded and noisy. It's a great place for groups, we saw a ton of bachelorette parties. Ordered 7 items because we couldn't decide, it was a little too much food but everything was delicious. Great service too.
