Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My boyfriend and I split the Deep Dish Malnati Chicago Classic, which includes sausage, mozzarella cheese & a buttercrust. And we were very pleasantly surprised by the deliciousness of the pizza. I think what really stuck out was how they don't skimp on the mozzarella cheese, so if you like a cheesy deep-dish you will be very happy here. And sometimes at certain deep-dish spots, the crust doesn't measure up to the tasty inside, but at Lou Malnati's that buttery crust is delectable.
