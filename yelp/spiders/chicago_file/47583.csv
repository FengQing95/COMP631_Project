Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This was seriously the best food I've had since living in this city! I've been here multiple times but after this last time I had to leave a review. The food is always fantastic, the sangria is the best tasting as well as the best deal in the city! If you guys have other staff half as good as her you're going to always have happy customers! I can't wait to come back again!!
