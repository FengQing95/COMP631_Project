Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////On to the food. I immediately went for the Classic Ribeye ($38) which is reasonably priced, but fatty. At least 1/4 was off to the side. Another member of my party ordered it as well and had the same problem. Go with the filet. I ordered the bone marrow ($8) and mushroom ($7) for sides. I've never had bone marrow before and won't soon again. There wasn't anything to it but blackened grizzle. The mushrooms were chopped and served alongside the steak. I'd try the corn which was surprisingly spicy.
