Art Institute of Chicago////a must see if you're visiting Chicago - a must-join if you live in Chicago. They have a wonderful collection that you simply do not tire of seeing, a really cool store and lunch at Terzo Piano in the Modern Wing is really very good. All-in-all a great location for visitors and Chicagoans alike.
