Smoque BBQ////After we all took our pictures, we went straight in for that brisket and one word came to all of our minds...mushy. The brisket was terrible. It was not brisket and it was definitely not BBQ. It was boiled meat that has been boiled for too long and served with a less than average BBQ sauce. There was no smoke ring, no smoke flavor, or any flavor at all. Yeah I know it's supposed to be fork tender or melt in your mouth tender, but there is a BIG line between melt in your mouth tender to having the whole piece disintegrate into nothing before it even touches your mouth. The sauce tasted like generic BBQ sauce that they poured in vinegar and mustard. It was nothing interesting or spectacular. The brisket chili was horrible. It was watery, no flavor, not enough salt, the beans were too mushy, and the brisket was non-existent in it. The cornbread was not good. It was not sweet, it was not savory, and it had no corn flavor. And the coleslaw tasted like pure apple cider vinegar and that's it. The vinegar was so harsh that any flavor or spice they put into that coleslaw was just obliterated by the vinegar.
