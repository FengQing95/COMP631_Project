Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is one of my all time favorite Chicago restaurants because of the quality of food and the intimate setting. I usually make a reservation to secure a table. There is first come first serve for the front and back bar area. These usually fill up. Their happy hour specials are worth coming early for. We always enjoy a few staples like sangria, bacon wrapped dates, tomato bread and croquettes. Plates are shareable so I'd recommend getting tapas and a main to share.
