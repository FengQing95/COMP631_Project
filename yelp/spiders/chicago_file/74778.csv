Little Goat Diner////I got the "This little piggy went to China" and was blown away with how flavorful it was. Somehow a cheddar biscuit, sausage, a sunny side up egg, strawberries, and an savory Asian sauce complimented each other perfectly. Our party also enjoyed the Bull's eye French toast and the Parathas burrito. We grabbed and donut at the attached bakery/cafe and will definitely be back.
