Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The paella at the ba-ba-reeba is the bomb. So good here. Try the chk, pork, and veggie paella. Â Start the the pintxo platter where you can taste the short rib and deep fried goat cheese. The best. Add the large selection of Spanish wine (I had the wine special at $7/glass) or the red sangria and it's a party dude.
