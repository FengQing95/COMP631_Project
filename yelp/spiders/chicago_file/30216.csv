Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ok...talking to Chicago locals, many couldn't recommend a good deep dish pizzeria. One person said to go to Lou's and we're so glad we did! Here's the scoop: you go in and FIRST put your name in for a table. Then, you go order your pizza  so it's ready when your table is ready. The system works brilliantly. We ordered a salad, which was great! Then came the deep dish! We got The Lou and added sausage.  It was delicious! Expect a deep dish (lol), with a crust that's almost like pastry crust, but not sweet. It perfectly soaked up the juices from the sauce and the meat. The sangria was quite good, as well. Don't let a local steer you away from trying a deep dish. This was a great experience!!
