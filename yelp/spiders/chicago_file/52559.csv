Smoque BBQ////There are only 2 registers, and the line was almost out the door when we arrived (there were 5 of us, and I'm glad that other customers were respectful of John's daughters- he had 2 at the time, but 3 now). It didn't move very quickly, and it always reached the door or beyond while we were there (we were inside for a good hour). Anyway, it took us about 10 minutes to order.
