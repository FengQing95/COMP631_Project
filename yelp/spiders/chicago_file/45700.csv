Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////For a Californian who visited Chicago, this place was where I had some of the best tapas that I have tasted outside of Spain.  Ba Ba Reeba gave me my jamon serrano fix and got me addicted to their sangria.  I came by twice during my visit because once just wasn't enough. Who goes somewhere twice in a new city? Ba Ba Reeba was worth it and if I had two stomachs I would have gone even more often!  I still have yet to find me some good jamon serrano in the SF Bay Area that will match Spain's and Ba Ba Reeba's.  Only tear was that the churros con chocolat was not like Spain's- it had cinnamon sugar (vs. plain) and the chocolate was on the too sweet side and wasn't thick enough.
