Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Lobster paella is not on the regular menu.  When I got there, I was sad to see Shrimp & Scallops.  Once I ordered that, I then saw that the obster and scallops paella was listed on the specials.  Our server indulged me and had the kitchen do Shrimp and Lobster for a little bit more.
