Art Institute of Chicago////But you have a chance to do some good while enjoying this incredible space as The Art Institute is collaborating with the Greater Chicago Food Depository (GCFD) and asking visitors to bring canned goods to the museum to help provide food for the Chicago Community. Â Rarely does GCFD have an opportunity to kick off a food drive in such a space, so PLEASE take canned goods when you go so you can get your art on and help someone out in need too!!!!
