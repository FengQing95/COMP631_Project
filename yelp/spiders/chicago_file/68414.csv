Little Goat Diner////We checked out LG on two occasions for brunch.  The first time we were lucky enough to be meeting friends that live nearby so they went around 10am and put down our name.  It was supposed to be a one hour and 45 min wait and it turned out to be less than an hour.  We didn't mind because we able to relax at their house while drinking cocktails.  The second time we went we were up early and decided to go around 8:30-9am.  That is a good time to go - no wait.  By around 9:30am it started to get packed and we noticed a line.
