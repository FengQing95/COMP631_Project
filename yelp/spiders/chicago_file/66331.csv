Little Goat Diner////We came here for an early dinner, and had a great experience initially - Sloppy goat, veggie burger, onion ring/fried pickle combo were all fantastic.  Soon after we got our dessert, the waitress said that we had to leave because there was a party coming and they needed the table - She even attempting a guilt trip by stating that it was 7:20 and they were supposed to be seated at 7:00.  We weren't even offered to change to a smaller table (there were a few available) or go to the bar, so we had to leave our half eaten dessert at the table.  It was a great experience until then, but the unclassiness of the end ruined it for me.
