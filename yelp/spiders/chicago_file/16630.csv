Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Been to Chicago 3 times and the highlight of the trip is always deep-dish pizza ... I must say after having  Duo, Giordano,  and now Lou 's hands down the crust was the best I've had. Tried the spinach stuffed bread and a personal pizza and wow ... amazing. ..only wish I could Stretch my stomach to try all their food ...it's a must try if you visit the windy city.
