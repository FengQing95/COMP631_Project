Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////All I can say is WOW!!! It's our 17th anniversary and we decided to celebrate at Bavettes.  Can I say that their bread is the most moist, chewy delicious bread in all of Chicago.We started with the baked crab cake. -light & flakey,  not greasy.  Whatever is in the crab cake sauce is the most amazing, succulent,  finger-licking stuff I've ever tasted. Next came the mixed green salad with shaved green apples. Light and refreshing. Thoughtful wine list. Filet mignon cooked to perfection. Roasted garlic mashed potatoes melt in your mouth. Top it all off with a truly gourmet chocolate cream pie. I've died and gone to heaven. We'll definitely be back! My only complaint is how dim the lighting is. You can see across the table but that's about it!
