Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Absolutely love this place. I came here years ago for a friends engagement party and I got hooked. I order the same things every time I go since they are so delicious but have to try the paella which I heard is really good. The sangria is amazing and my gf and I drink couple pitchers every time we go. I love the bacon wrapped dates I ask for those last so they are kinda like a desert at the end of the meal
