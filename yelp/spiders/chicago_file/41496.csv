Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I had never had tapas before this so I'm not really experienced to say how great they were.  For what it was the food was pretty good.  The waitress was able to recommend some items and drinks for us.  The prices were way up there, but thank goodness for Christmas bonuses.  My boss got me a $100 gift card and recommended that we go to Ba-Ba-Reeba.  It was only my husband and myself that dined there and let's just say I only have about $20 on that gift card now.
