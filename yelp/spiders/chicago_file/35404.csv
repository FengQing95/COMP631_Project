Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////What a great experience! Beautiful restaurant and atmosphere. Went for my boyfriends birthday dinner, was seated in the parlor. The ambience was perfect- music, dim lighting, comfortable seating. Drinks were perfectly recommended from our waiter. We shared the avocado clam salad, 22 oz ribeye and mashed potatoes. Food was amazing!
