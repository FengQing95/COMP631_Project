Little Goat Diner////There was an hour wait at noon on a Saturday, but we were seated after about 40 minutes. We ordered the Little Pig Went to China (yes that is what it's called), the Bull's Eye French Toast, and the Pork Belly Home Fries. The Bull's Eye French Toast featured fried chicken and strawberries over what was probably the best french toast I've ever had. The combination of chicken and strawberries may sound odd, but it was actually phenomenal with the super fluffy french toast.
