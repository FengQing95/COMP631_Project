Art Institute of Chicago////I'm most definitely not one for museums, and especially not art museums, but this was a pretty cool stop during my visit to Chicago. I mostly don't belong because of my juvenile behavior around art (there was a sculpture of a naked woman in a bathtub!!!), but I do respect hard work and talent when I see it.
