Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been to Cafe Ba Ba Reeba twice and I can't wait for my third visit. There isn't an item on the menu that I've tried and didn't enjoy, except for perhaps the patatas bravas, which were a tad spicy for me but seem to be a popular item. My favorites: the citrus-cured salmon, the beef empanada, the rotating spanish artisinal cheese plate, the rioja-braised short ribs with mashed potatoes, and the goat cheese croqueta. The potato and onion omelette and the bacon-wrapped dates are pretty good, too. I hate ordering something off a menu that I've ordered before when there are appealing options I've yet to try, but I liked these items so much I think next time I go it will be a real battle of "get that again" vs. "explore the menu." I don't drink wine or sangria often but I did like both of the sangrias I tried here very much.
