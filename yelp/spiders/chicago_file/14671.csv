Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I got the renowned "classic" which is sausage and he had the pepperoni. At about $7 each, it was loaded with.......cheese! I love me some cheese but wow, this cheese weighed me Down. Honestly, I didnt taste the butter...it tasted regular to me. Im missing it. It was crispy, dont get me wrong...my palette just didnt Get what everyone Got. The sausage pizza was better than pepperoni, I must say that. And he, he who loves pepperoni agreed.
