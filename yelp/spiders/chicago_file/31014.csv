Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I had no idea what to expect from deep dish - sorta thought it would be a sloppy mess. This was not the case at all. Ordered a small classic (with sausage) for two people. The waiter was amazing - he let us know a) the pizza takes 45 minutes and b) you gotta use a fork and knife to start. This pizza is so wild - unlike any pizza I've ever had. The crust is baked to perfection - buttery, thin and crisp just like a pie. Then we got the perfect layers of cheese, sausage, tomatoes and more cheese. The ratio is out of hand and the sausage is so good.
