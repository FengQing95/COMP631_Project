Smoque BBQ////visited this place during my trip to chitown. i never realized how popular this place was. i mean yeah, there was a line out front but i thought it was simply because the place was "too small" to accommodate the hungry crowds during dinner time. mind you that i didn't ask to come here, i was simply taken here and told that they had great ribs.
