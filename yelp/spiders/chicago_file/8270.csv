Art Institute of Chicago////Coming from Houston where the biggest art museum we have is MFAH and the best being the Contemporary Art Museum, this place far exceeds those places!  I came here the first time for the opening of the Silk Roads exhibit - there were performances going on in and outside the building, plus it all being a free preview.  Considering I had friend from Texas in town, it made it a great trip!
