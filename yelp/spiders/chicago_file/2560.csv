The Purple Pig////We came in for a 1pm-ish light lunch to hold us over until our steak dinner, and were wholly disappointed to find that a 30 minute wait for a table was probably going to deter us from making this our lunch spot (especially after seeing how absolutely warm and inviting it was in the inside - beautiful decor that oozes of a Barcelona taperia with a modern, clean vibe as well). But, we lucked out and found two seats at the bar right in front of the line cooks. This probably is what fated our lunch at The Purple Pig to be as magical as it was.
