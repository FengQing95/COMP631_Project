Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We sat down, was thanked for waiting (props on the customer service), and ordered the rest of our food (cesar salad & drinks). Â Our waitress was friendly and considerate and was swamped but took good care of us - drinks were refilled, food came out as soon as it was ready.
