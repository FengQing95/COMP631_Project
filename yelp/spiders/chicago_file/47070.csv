Smoque BBQ////I live in downtown Chicago.  What could possibly convince me to ride the blue line for 40 minutes, almost all the way to O'Hare when I am starving?  Only the best BBQ in Chicago.  I'm talking good barbecue, the kind where the meat on the bone from your ribs has so much flavor that you don't even need to put the sauce on it.  The Mac & Cheese has that nice crispiness that true good southern style M&C should have.  The pecan pie is to die for!  Definitely get the sides.  As for the pulled pork, it wasn't too dry, nor did it taste like it was sitting in water for hours waiting for me, it was just right.  Despite being far out in the suburbs, the place was packed.  I went here on the recommendation of a friend who's from KC, and I have to admit this place rocks!
