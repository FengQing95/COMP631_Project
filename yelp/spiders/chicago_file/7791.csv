Art Institute of Chicago////If you live in the area, you can visit for free by checking out a pass from the Chicago Public Library, or visiting on Thursday night (although it's only for three hours and you'll certainly need more time to really take it all in). A membership is only $80 a year and that includes admission for two adults and a few other goodies (for a couple, that's only $40 each).
