Little Goat Diner////At 3:30 PM, the place was still hopping with a long wait but the food is well worth the wait. We decided to go with both a lunch item and a breakfast dish. The lunch dish was the "Los Drowned" which is a braised beef sandwich with havarti, avocado, pickled peppers & onions and spicy mayo on a hoagie. For the breakfast dish, we wanted to get the bull's eye french toast which is basically chicken and waffles but they were out of that so we settled on the "Fat Elvis Waffles". These waffles are topped with banana, peanut butter-butter and bacon maple syrup. I'm not usually a sweet breakfast person but I could eat that again. Definitely a must visit when in Chicago.
