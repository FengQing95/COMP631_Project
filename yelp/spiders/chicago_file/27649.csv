Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////What else to say? I wholeheartedly agree with others reviews. This place is the bomb! I don't have pizza as often as I'd like (watching my calories intake these days) but if I ever crave for one, Lou's place is the first place I go. This is probably the most authentic Chicago-style pizza near where I live and is my go-to spot whenever my friends come visiting.
