Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////There's this holding pen as I call it in the front where you check in, then more doors go to the restaurant. Like they are saying, "Oooh, you can't get in yet!" Pass out. Like they are doing you a favor. Do you want my greenbacks or not?! You know how the Violet Hour is annoying? Oh geez.
