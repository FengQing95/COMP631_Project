Smoque BBQ////So, I learned about this place from DDD, and every time I drove by, I would see a long line of people waiting to enter the restaurant. So I was smart and ordered take-out. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a side of mac-n-cheese, and my hubby got the brisket sandwich w/a side of BBQ beans. It was good, but definitely more hyped up than anything. The meat was tender, and it comes with a side of their sauce, which we poured on to combat the dryness of both meats. The coleslaw was delicious, as was the mac-n-cheese and bbq beans. And the peach cobbler was great, too. So overall, okay, would I come here again? Honestly, unless I was starving and this place was the only thing nearby, probably not. Â I just don't see myself craving this place. I have yet to try their ribs, so maybe on another rainy, boring day, I'll give them a shot again.
