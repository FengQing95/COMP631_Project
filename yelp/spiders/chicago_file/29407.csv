Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////You get in line to first make your order, then you put your name down and wait. As many of you know it takes at least 30-40 minutes for them to make the deep dish pizza so 45 minutes was no big deal as we would have been waiting that time anyways. We ended up ordering a large Malnati Chicago classic with added mushrooms to half the pie.
