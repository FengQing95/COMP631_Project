Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's is a staple in Chicago. You definitely need to eat deep dish pizza when visiting in Chicago, and this is one of the best chains you can find. However, at the location we went to, the pizza was just ok, the service was average to slow, and the wings were great. I wouldn't attribute all Lou Malnati's to be this way, but I also wouldn't say Lou M's is the all time best place to get your deep dish pizza fix.
