Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The first thing I noticed about this pie was that it holds heat WAY better than a thinner crust pie. So that kicked my delivery judgement out the window. Secondly, how is this thing not the greasiest thing ever? It just isn't. I have no idea how, but hot damn it's good. Third, that sauce. You can actually taste the fresh tomatoes--obviously homemade. The sauce had enough flavor to carry this entire cheese pizza. Fourth, this is REAL deep dish pizza. That stuff in Cleveland I thought was deep dish, isn't. Can never be.
