Little Goat Diner////Diner quality food at inflated prices. From the menu I think only the little piggy goes to China is the only dish worth the price. Everything else is standard diner fare but more expensive. I was hoping this restaurant lived up the the "goat" family level of quality but it seemed that only the namesake girl and goat is worth it.
