Little Goat Diner////I kind of expected to hate this place, as the hordes of self-professed foodies who fawn over Stephanie Izard tend to annoy me (I have nothing against Ms. Izard, I just don't care much about celebrity chefs) and I thought it seemed a little too hung up on its own cutesy-ness (e.g. the menu says sammiches instead of sandwiches). Yet, I decided to give it a try because it's in the neighborhood and I had heard some good things. Â
