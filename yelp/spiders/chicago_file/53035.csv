Smoque BBQ////I give the chopped brisket at Smoque - Five Stars. I usually go for pulled pork when it comes to BBQ, even chicken, but the Chopped Brisket at Smoque is nicely seasoned, charred, and lean. The sauce is thin and vinegary and adds to the flavor. The brisket is so good they put it in their baked beans, which are smokey and delicious.
