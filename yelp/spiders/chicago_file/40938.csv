Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Although rooms were available, management was not willing to work at all with a group of 30 (nonprofit) for an early dinner on New Year's Eve without a $3,000 minimum. Having celebrated NYE in Chicago for 15 years, a 6:00 to 7:30 p.m. dinner does not exactly infringe on the typical Chicago New Year's Eve crowd. Other area restaurants have been happy to accommodate the group each year with an even later start time, but we wanted to try something new. I'm not sure it's possible for a person to eat $100 worth of tapas. Very unreasonable and goes against advertised pricing and group specifications on the web site. I will no longer patronize CBB.
