Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Love coming to this place and getting their red sangria! Came with my best friends and luckily found a reservation at 6pm last minute. They get booked really quickly so plan ahead of time! I ordered off the restaurant week menu and ordered the seared morcilla sausage, deviled egg, roasted bacon wrapped dates, grilled iberico pork, and butterscotch custard. All of the food we ordered came at different times which got a little confusing, but the food was still delicious. I highly recommend trying their grilled iberico pork with red chimichurri sauce! The total of the bill including tip & tax was $173. You are also only allowed to stay for a little over an hour to dine which can feel a little rushed. But overall had a great time as usual with their amazing drinks and food.
