Smoque BBQ////As for the food I had the beef brisket. The brisket was dry, I am not sure if it was dry because the cut of brisket did not have enough fat on it or because it was over cooked. We were there during a very busy dinner service so I don't think it had been sitting around all day. The barbeque sauce was tasty, the sides were typical barbeque restaurant sides, nothing to write home about. I would not make another trip to Smoque, the dry brisket is not worth the trip.
