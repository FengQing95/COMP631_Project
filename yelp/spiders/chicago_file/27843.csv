Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I am from the northeast. I prefer NY style pizza, above all others. This did not change after visiting this place, but it was indeed delicious deep dish pizza. I ordered the single serving "Lou" which is made with several mixed veggies, including mushroom, spinach, and topped with tomatoes. Â  I was still a bit hungry after the single serving pie. Overall, I recommend it and would go back if I was in the area.
