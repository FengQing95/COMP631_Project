The Purple Pig////Grilled Octopus entree came with fingerling potatoes, green beans and salsa verde. The octopus was tender and perfectly cooked. The Salsa verde was a flavorful blend of salt, acid and spice which complemented the sweet flavor of the octopus perfectly. Â I really enjoyed this dish.
