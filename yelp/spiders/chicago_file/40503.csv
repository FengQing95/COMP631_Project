Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I called to make a reservation and there were none available, but the helpful gentleman that answered the phone suggested that I walk in at around 9 PM and that he would likely be able to seat me. I got there just after nine and was seated at the bar in the parlor bar area (downstairs). The first thing that came to mind was old school speakeasy.
