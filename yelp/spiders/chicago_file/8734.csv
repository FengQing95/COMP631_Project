Art Institute of Chicago////The collections are extraordinary and reflect the foresight, buying power, and influence of Chicago's power families who donated swathes of work to the AIC among others. You'll see many of the same donor names coming up, again and again. Many of the pieces I studied in my textbooks through university and postgrad hang on the walls here, where you can get as close as the security guards allow you.
