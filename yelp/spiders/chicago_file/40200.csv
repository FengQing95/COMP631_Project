Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////New steaks came out and were great second time, they gave us fresh new sides as well and packed leftovers. We ordered chocolate pie and Joel looked disappointed maybe more time he will have stay late. So he walked away and asked my husband maybe we should take dessert togo instead so he can go home. He said yes. So Joel was at register I told him we will take the pie togo. He took a receipt and ripped it off crinkled it in his hand and let out a huge sigh. Didn't say anything to me just walked towards bartending area. Then reappears after with pie and sparkler. Our reservation was 9:45 We left after midnight nobody else was there but staff.
