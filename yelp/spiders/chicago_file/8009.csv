Art Institute of Chicago////When we were in the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam, there was a piece of writing about Van Gogh's "The Bedroom." They said there were two copies of the painting. One in Amsterdam, and the other in THE ART INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO. I wanted to scream "What, WHAT?! Chicago REPRESENT!"
