Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When I bit into this pizza... I thought to myself, I need to order some more ASAP... I will need at least two more this week. It was just sensational. The butter, crispy crust was just delicious and the cheese was in a class of it's own. It literally is not allowed to be mentioned with any other regular pizza that I dine on.
