Smoque BBQ////To me, BBQ is either spectacular or run-of-the-mill. Only two divisions. I also don't think location has much to do with it. I've been to places in Tennessee where the Q tasted like something Denny's might serve, and then you have a joint like Smoque that puts out like a Memphis shack.
