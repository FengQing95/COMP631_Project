Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I heard about this place a while back and fell for the hype and made a reservation 3 months out. We got a 930 on a Saturday and honestly was not impressed. It was loud and dark and the food was nothing special. We got stuck in the basement and the service was slow. It was expensive and I probably won't be heading back any time soon.
