The Purple Pig////We started off with the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes - Definitely my favorite dish of the meal. The meat was incredibly tender and soft and it really melts in your mouth. You can really see how the milk flavors the meat as well. The mashed potatoes on the bottom were amazing too. I just wish there was more!
