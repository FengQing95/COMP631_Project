Little Goat Diner////This is my 4th year in Chicago and I still haven't been able to get into Girl and the Goat so when Little Goat opened I jumped on that like it was my job! Knowing Chicago restaurants that do not take reservations, we gave ourselves an hour wait and an hour it took. This texting thing is awesome because you get to track the parties ahead of you and it gives you something to do while you wait.
