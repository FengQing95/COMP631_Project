Art Institute of Chicago////Incredible Art museum. Fast Pass tickets get you in quicker but you have to wait in the long regular line to then check your bags and retrieve them. Makes no sense to wait in a ticket line to get your stuff back. And the lines are long. Â Best art if any museum. Most poorly run place I have been. 5 stars for displays 0 for service.
