Smoque BBQ////Second only to Lillie's Q. Definitely top 5 BBQ pit in Chicago for me. Actually go here quite often nowadays. I usually get the half slab of baby back ribs with a double side of mac & cheese or mac & cheese and fries. You get a choice of two sides with your platter. Whatever you do, make sure you get the mac & cheese, you won't be disappointed.
