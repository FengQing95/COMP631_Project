Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////When Wildberry opened I went 8 out of 10 work days the first two weeks they were there.  My co-workers are beginning to think I own stock in this place!  Despite what you might think, it is not just pancakes and breakfast foods. They have fantastic, addictive salads (and for me "addictive" and "salads" do not normally go together).  Also they have sandwiches and burgers.  Some of my favorites include the French Dip sandwich which they serve with horseradish, the Red Velvet pancakes are too unbelievable to be real (and only served once in awhile, but wow!), the Espanola omelette is so good with a kick of salsa on the side.  The only thing I've ever tried that I didn't like is the Turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce - it wasn't bad but just ordinary for this place, whose dishes are fairly inventive.
