Smoque BBQ////They are really busy but rather fast! I like they seat everyone after they order so the place stays organized and don't have random people just taking up spots. The customers are very self aware too and doesn't take up a spot for hours. The food is great too! Briskets are amazing! It's kind of funny how all rib places just have better brisket than ribs lol
