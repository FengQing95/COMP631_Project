Little Goat Diner////Goddamned great food. Annoying good. I'm not good at explaining food flavors and the like, but even their cocktails were thought out from initial taste through aftertaste. I ate too much now and I need to sleep, but the entree was so damned good (the pulled pork) I forgot to take a friggen picture.
