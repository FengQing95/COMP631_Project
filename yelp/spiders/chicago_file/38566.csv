Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////  To conclude, John brought out the most amazing salted caramel ice cream birthday surprise for the birthday boy and just like everything else that 100% hit the mark, salted caramel  anything is my boyfriend's absolute favorite,  luck would have it that's what we were given and it was the best salted caramel ice cream I've ever had, I would go back and get that again. John also suggested a perfect and different kind of port, the name escapes me.
