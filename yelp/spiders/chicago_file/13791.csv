Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I am not a fan of pizza at all. However, I got a chance to be introduced to Lou Malnati's deep dish pizza. I have to say...it has totally changed my life and I fell in love with it so deeply. I can't describe how much I love it, but I have used it as my birthday cake last year. This is to let yall know how much I love it!! If you ever wanna try something new, maybe you can give it a try!!
