Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have to admit I've only eaten in the actual restaurant once, I'm a delivery addict. Even if delivery Â takes a full hour or if there is a long line for a table, it is ALWAYS worth the wait. My favorite is just the plain cheese. Although the Lou and the Deluxe are also good. (Hell, everything is good!) I've also had salad delivered, which was also yummy. Yay Lou Malnati's!
