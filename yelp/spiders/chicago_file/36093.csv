Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////reservations are a bit hard to come by for this swanky smooth sexy spot in river north, so most of the time i have just waited for seats at the bar, which offers the full menu, and you're closer to the cocktails. totally the right move. there is a large selection of house cocktails but i usually get the negroni, and they do an amazing job here.
