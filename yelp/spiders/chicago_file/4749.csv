The Purple Pig////I came here to eat with family and friends for my birthday and we had a wonderful experience! The servers were on top of it. I never had to ask for a refill, they explained in quick and precise detail, each dish on the menu and gave great recommendations. The food and service were both superb. I'd highly recommend this if you have not gone here before.
