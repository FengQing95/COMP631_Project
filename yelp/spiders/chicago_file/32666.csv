Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////In a nutshell: Five star food, in River North, at three-star prices. Everything I've tried (a couple steaks, chicken, duck, most of the sides) has been very good and the drinks, particularly the Sazerac and the Weller Old Fashioned, are fantastic. Service is very good and if you open a tab at the bar, they will give you your card back and keep the tab so you don't have to go back the next day to get it.
