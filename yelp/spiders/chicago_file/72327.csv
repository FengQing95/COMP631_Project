Little Goat Diner////So disappointed. Atmosphere was fun. But I became very sick after eating there the first time. I thought it was just me so I gave it a second chance. Took my family there for my daughters birthday. But we both got very nauseated Â after eating there. Will not go back and would not recommend. This was our first experience with Izards restaurants. So sad.
