Little Goat Diner////I have been to Little Goat several times and have had both the breakfast and lunch items. Beware if you do not eat pork about 60% of the menu is not available to you. After going to Little Goat with a group of friends (who do not eat pork either) we ordered most of the non-pork breakfast items and shared them. We had the corned beef hash with eggs, fat elvis waffles, parathas burrito, and the spanish omlette. Everything was delicious! The only item I would not recommend is the parathas burrito, the paratha was very good and fresh, but the filling was skimpy, so the dish was mostly bread.
