Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Why the bad review? After my fourth bite of pizza a bug started crawling over everything on our side of the bar, including my phone and plate. It looked like a smaller cockroach-not sure exactly what it was... I instantly lost my appetite. Will not return. Will not recommend...especially with like 30 people always constantly in the entrance area does not make for a great atmosphere. It did not stop my husband from eating his meal, but I couldn't touch another bite...all I kept thinking was what crawls all over the plate and cook prep areas at night?!? So grossed out!!!
