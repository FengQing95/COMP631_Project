Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Regarding the pizza, I liked that they offered personal sizes. This is perfect when you have a large group or when people have different preferences or dietary needs. There were three of us in our group and we each decided to order a personal size. I ordered the deep dish cheese with peppers and onions, and decided to pay extra for the buttercrust. To me, it was the perfect size, I even had left overs. The pizza was good, my only complaints were that I wish that it had more taste and the sauce seemed a little watery. Looking back, I wish that I had added a meat. This probably would have added the taste that I was looking for. Also, maybe if the onions and peppers had been cut a little larger, this probably would have added flavor.
