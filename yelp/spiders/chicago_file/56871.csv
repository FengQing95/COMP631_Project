Smoque BBQ////The rest of the experience was a solid four. I wasn't blown away by the mac and cheese, and I can't handle the vineger slaw that yankees insist on calling cole slaw (if it's not creamy, it's not cole slaw.) That being said, I still ate all the mac and cheese and slaw on my plate, so it's not like they were bad.
