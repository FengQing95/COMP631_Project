Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came here during the ridiculously busy dinner rush and was seated in about 30 minutes. They take your pizza order when you put your name in so it comes shortly after you are actually seated - great planning on their part. Pro tip: try to get a table in the back so that you aren't surrounded by the noisy crowd around the bar and folks trying to get their names / orders in. We got a Malanati's Salad (the salami bits taste quite a lot like bacon bits) and a small Lou pizza. The pizza was fantastic. Everything I could have wanted out of a true Chicago deep dish pizza. Highly recommend, but as there are many other locations, perhaps trying a different, less touristy/busy area might be a better option!
