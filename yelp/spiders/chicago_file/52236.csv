Smoque BBQ////It was fate that brought me here. I saw the place on the food network just a few days ago. Last night I was talking to my professor about it who highly recommended Smoque. She tried to go there this past weekend but the line out the door was crazy and they ran out of brisket! Â Now it was cold last Saturday in Chi-town but she talked about it passionately---it being the brisket. Today I was planning on going to Chinatown for dim sum. It ended up that I didn't feel like going through all the traffic and my own mother suggested to get off the next exit and head towards here. Guess what? That was my highlight for today! I had the sliced beef brisket sandwich, french fries, corn bread, and the cole slaw! Needless to say, I will definitely head back!!!! Just thinking about the whole experience is making my mouth water.
