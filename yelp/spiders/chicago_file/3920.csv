The Purple Pig////Be prepared to get cozy with your newfound friends (the complete strangers joining you at communal tables) because this place is popular and relatively small, so they pack folks in. We wandered in midday on a Sunday, and it was busy but there was no wait whatsoever. I guess we got lucky to get no reservation and no wait time. Service was incredibly friendly and prompt. All of the menu items are quite large, so go with a group and eat family style so you can sample more items because everything is great and there are a lot of options. This is a meat-lover's dream. Also, they carry Malort, so order a shot.
