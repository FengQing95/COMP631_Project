Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavettes is not only delicious, but has such lovely decor! My boyfriend and I love steak and French food, so we figured this would be a perfect fit and it was! It's pretty dark inside, but music is a little loud (not too loud) making it intimate but still upbeat. Feels like you're in an upscale Parisian bistro.
