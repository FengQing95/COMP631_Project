The Purple Pig////Squid Ink Ravioli ($20)-1/5 No No No!! This is honestly one of the worst dishes I've had in a while. Corn and snow crab- didn't sound too bad huh? Rarely any snow crab and lots of corn (I kinda hate corn in soupy texture though). The Ravioli is just filled with corn flavor like soup. And they only give you 3 ravioli (thank god, cause it actually tastes really bad).
