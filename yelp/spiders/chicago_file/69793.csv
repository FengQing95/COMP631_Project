Little Goat Diner////My friends and I stopped in for early dinner on a Saturday.  We had reservations, but it didn't seem terribly busy to begin with.  We ordered the nachos, pork belly pancake, and a Korean burger.   We also had the smoked fries, garlic mashed potatoes, and tempura mashed potatoes.  For dessert, we shared the Betterfinger sundae.
