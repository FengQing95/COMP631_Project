Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////After a first disappointing experience where my steak had little to no flavor, my friends meal was not prepared correctly Â or cooked to a common standard of acceptably, common bourbons were out of stock and my friends birthday cake came with a charge, I made contact with the manager. I would like to note that at no time did the server proactively bring a host or manager over to try to smooth over the failures of the evening until we asked for him. The manager invited me back to make a reservation at anytime by did not assist with the pricing of the expensive $100+ per person despite the disarray of the meal.
