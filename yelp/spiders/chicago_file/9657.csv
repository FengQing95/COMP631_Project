Art Institute of Chicago////This was a ve y popular spot. Lots of collections. Set up well.  Staff was good and knowledgeable. Worth the $25.00. Check with your hotel​ though for discount coupons. In millennium Park so very convenient to see this and other attractions there. Give yourself several hours
