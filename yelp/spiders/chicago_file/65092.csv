Smoque BBQ////We went to Smoque on a Saturday night for dinner with KT and BS.  The place was very busy is not really set up to handle their fame.  Their system works well in that a host gets your order number and when a table comes available he seats you and puts your order in.  This works, but in the meantime you really have no place to wait.  You end up standing in awkward places between tables and in what aisles there are.  We did have a fairly long wait, although it may have just seemed that way.  I think I would try another night of the week, but who knows, it may be the same.
