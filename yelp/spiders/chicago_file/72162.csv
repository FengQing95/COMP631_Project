Little Goat Diner////Who knew something so simple can be made so good...? Originally, I had really wanted to try Girl and Goat. However, the reservations were all booked until next month and I am not going to wait 2 hours for dinner. Thankfully, I was able to make a reservation across the street! Â I had the Los Drowned and my boyfriend the Fat Club, which to me was nothing special. I definitely recommend the Los Drowned!! Wow, what a blast of flavor! The bread was so soft and they do not drench it with the sauce given. Instead it's on the side so you have the choice to "drown" it if you'd like!
