The Purple Pig////The most delish pork shoulder I've ever had. The vegetables were amazing. I had the grilled broccoli and tried my date's cauliflower. Sat at the bar and the bartender was very attentive and helpful with wine choice. Be prepared to experience a little aggressiveness when trying to grab a seat at the bar with the rest of us vultures trying to get in on the action. Lively vibe here combined with amazing food, great wine selection, and some well selected beers on tap gives this place a 5 star rating for sure.
