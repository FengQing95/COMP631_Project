Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Little did we know that the dessert was equally astounding. Back in California we have this chain called BJ's Chicago Style pizza, and it has this chocolate chip pizza with vanilla ice cream. I saw it on the menu here and I had to try it...boy it was so much better here. The quality of ingredients is so much higher and much more generous.
