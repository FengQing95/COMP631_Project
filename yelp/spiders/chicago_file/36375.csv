Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We started with the baked goat cheese.  If you love cheese as much as I do, it's a must.  I've had similar dishes elsewhere, but I really enjoyed the bread that they served with it and the chunky tomatoes on top of the cheese.  The service is also wonderful at Bavette's - a waiter noticed we still had cheese, but no bread, so he brought us a basket of bread.
