Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For dinner we had the short rib stroganoff and southern style fried chicken. The pasta was very good, but obviously fairly decadent. You'll want to be very hungry if ordering this dish. The fried chicken was good and not too greasy. It's mostly dark meat, so if you prefer white meat, I'd reconsider. We also got the elote corn (awesome, but rich) and mashed potatoes (rich as well, but really good).
