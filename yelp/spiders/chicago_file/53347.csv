Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////So I came here for the first time this past weekend. I had called and made a reservation about two weeks in advance for a party of six and when we arrived, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the place looked so cozy. The ambient lighting really added to the atmosphere. My boyfriend and I came with his two brothers and their wife and fiance​. We had a nice triple date night. The food that we ordered was delicious, and we were also surprised by the bill​ since other places we have gone to have resulted in quite a larger bill- and this one was quite reasonable.
