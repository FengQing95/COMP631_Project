Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I am a native of chicago and full disclosure I rarely eat deep dish anymore. When I do it's at Lou's! The crust is amazing, the manner in which they construct the deep dish is perfect. It's important that flavor doesn't just happen. The locations are all run really well rarely will anyone be disappointed. If your from out of town and want to know which deep dish to have Lou's is the only choice!
