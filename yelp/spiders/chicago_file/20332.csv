Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Three big slices and a couple refills of diet Cokes later, I was done. DONE. Each slice practically weighed a pound each. I needed a siesta big time, to lay my head down on something, anything. Back to the hotel, we go. Food coma had taken me by the huevos, and I was at its mercy. Lou Malnati's, you knocked my socks off. Literally.
