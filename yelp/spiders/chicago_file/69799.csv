Little Goat Diner////Ok, so I tried Girl and the Goat (wasn't impressed) , and tried Little Goat and was even less impressed.  Eh.  Next time I'll just go to Applebees, and stop off at the grocery store, get some ice cream, cheese crackers, melt some chocolate down, make my own chocolate cheese crackers, dump as much as I want into my sundae and call it a day.
