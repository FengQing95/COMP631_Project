Art Institute of Chicago////I'm amazed at how many famous works of art I saw at the Art Institute. I knew there were many well-known artists and paintings here, but I am in complete awe. Even those who aren't art aficionados can appreciate the paintings of Monet, Renoir, Picasso, O'Keefe, Dali, and Warhol, to name a few.
