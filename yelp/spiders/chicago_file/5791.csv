The Purple Pig////The broccoli, although seems like such a boring plate to order, was so delicious. It had this sauce on it that was creamy with a crunch factor - I'd definitely recommend this! The pork belly and tenderloin were cooked very well and super tender. Some of the items it came with, like the pickled carrots, helped balance out the flavors nicely.
