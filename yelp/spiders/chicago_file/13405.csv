Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////ever go some place and get the distinct feeling like the person helping you thinks you're a dick?  not that they think your name is "Dick", but more that they think you're a penis.  not an actual penis, but more like in the derogatory sense.  anyway, i didn't totally feel like that here.
