Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was our first real deep dish pizza experience. We had the stuffed spinach bread - chewy and cheesy, the "Lou" and the Malnati Chicago Classicâ„¢. Overall, the bread was awesome but the pizza was OK. I was not a fan with the crust (very hard) and preferred the New York style thin crust. Later, I found out that you were not supposed to order the personal size.
