Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Ridiculously good. That's the only way to sum it up. Get the wedge salad. The bacon that comes on top tastes more like steak than bacon. I had a couple bites of my wife's fillet and it was perfect. It melted in my mouth. The pomme frites were very good as well. My strip steak and asparagus were satisfactory. The cocktails were amazing. I had a couple whiskey sour's and they did it right. My wife had a Dark and Stormy (which is made with ginger beer) and was also great. The only downfall is that it was pretty pricy. This would be a great place if you're looking to go out on the town.
