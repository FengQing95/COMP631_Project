Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Thank you Bavette's for a fantastic evening. My girlfriend and I were invited to have dinner here and it was worth every penny. The staff was very efficient, you can tell this is a solid team. The outside patio felt intimate and the interior is stylish and romantic. All the portion sizes are quite generous. We had the beef tartare, Caesar salad and petit filet, amazing! I split my steak in half and it only took two cuts of the knife. Truly an exceptional restaurant.
