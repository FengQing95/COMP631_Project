Smoque BBQ////I had heard about Smoque from so many people but since I don't have a car, I haven't been able to get there. So last Sunday my friends and I were going kayaking but it started to rain. I lay down on the couch and started to watch the Food Network and Diners. Dives, and Drive-Ins was on and they were featuring Smoque!
