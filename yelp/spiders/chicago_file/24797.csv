Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The crust was crunchy, not soft at all, anywhere, and a little bit mealy.  (This was the butter crust, ordered "just right").  It also tasted somewhat of baking soda--it had that off, objectionable taste I get when I try, and fail, to make homemade dough.  Despite the fact that we ordered extra sauce, what we got was basically nothing (and I'm not suggesting they forgot).  It tasted of nothing but stewed tomatoes--no flavor or seasoning almost at all!  The cheese was good, although there was too much of it in relation to the sauce.
