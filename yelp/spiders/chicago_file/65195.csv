Smoque BBQ////Per my usual BBQ order, I went with the ribs. Smoque touts their ribs as a memphis-style dry rub with their St. Louis ribs being "meatier and smokier than the baby backs." It was really just okay. At this point, I had only had fall-off-the-bone, delicious ribs in Austin and I felt that even though Smoque's was decent, it wasn't worth the wait.
