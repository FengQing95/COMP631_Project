The Purple Pig////Phenomenal tapas and extensive drink menu. They have experienced staffs climbing up the ladder to get your wine because there are  SO MANY WINES. The new location follows a lot of the old layout with an open kitchen. I didn't see any outdoor seating which is a bummer as they're now located in a commercial or residential building. I ordered a very simple meal - charted broccoli and dry rose. (I had went to pequods right before and wasn't so hungry after stuffing down a personal pan deep dish).
