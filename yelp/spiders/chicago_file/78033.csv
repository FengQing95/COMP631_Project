Little Goat Diner////The upstairs space is gorgeous, with big open windows and an outside patio that can be used for casual receptions (unfortunately we went on a chilly, rainy day, so we didn't get to use it). Â The best part though was the open kitchen at the far end of the room, anyone could get up at any point and watch them making our food (sadly, Stephanie Izard wasn't there. :) )
