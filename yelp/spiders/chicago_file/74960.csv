Little Goat Diner////Let me just get this over with and say, I was a little disappointed. Not because the place is disappointing, but more so because my expectations were probably just too high. This was my first time dining in this part of Chicago so it was nice to see all the people dressed up for Italian, Indian, Chinese, and good ole' American dinners. This place is on the Chicago list of "rooftop food destinations" and we weren't able to be seated up there. So that was a bummer. Second, the whole place just felt crammed. Not like I was rubbing shoulders with anyone, but we got this reservation a week in advance and we were seated in a small 2-person table at the end of a divider wall.
