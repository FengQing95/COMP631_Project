Little Goat Diner////Went there around midnight after a long work day, I was not expecting to get something really good at that time. I had the tofu griddle sandwich, which came out nicely presented and the taste was amazing! The combination of lightly fried tofu with goat cheese and pickled veggies got me hooked. Definitely go back there to try more of the menu.
