Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place has it all!! Excellent food, service, and decor.  We ordered the crab-cake, short rib stroganoff, and flat iron steak.  All of it, I mean ALL of it was delicious!  I've eaten a many steak and I cannot say I've ever tasted a flat iron steak that was prepared and tasted more like a rib eye.  The ambiance was very, very nice; new look with a "prohibition era" style, even down to the silverware.  Too bad I live in Texas or I would be here regularly.  To the owners - would you consider expanding to Houston?
