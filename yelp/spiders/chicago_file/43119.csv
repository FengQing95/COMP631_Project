Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////They rotate items on and off the menu pretty frequently, which is a blessing and a curse. As excited as I am to try the goat cheese in tomato sauce dish that has appeared, there were several menu items I had enjoyed or mentally bookmarked to try later that are now gone. Bummer. Maybe they'll rotate back in someday?
