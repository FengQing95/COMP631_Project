Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We were in town for the holidays and had dinner after a play. I was absolutely pleased with the service and food. As a party of 4 adults, we had 2 filets, 1 salmon and 1 bone in filet along with assorted sides. The food was exceptional. The bone in filet came out a little overcooked but the staff immediately corrected it. We also had lemon meringue pie and chocolate cream pie for desserts. They were phenomenal and we could not finish them both. We will definitely return next time in town.
