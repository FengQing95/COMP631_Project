Smoque BBQ////This place easily deserves all the praise it gets. I would 100% recommend Smoque, and of all the BBQ places that exist in the Midwest Smoque holds its own ground even compared to much of the BBQ I've had in the South. You have to prepare to wait through the line to order for dine-in, and numerous people called in to take their orders to go, which might be the right choice given the small confines of the restaurant. I came with 3 friends, and we waited for about 30 minutes, which wasn't as painful as it sounds as we were inundated with the smell of the delicious food to come. By the time we ordered, we didn't even have to wait at all to score a 4 person table, a big plus as I was afraid we wouldn't have a place in time for our meal.
