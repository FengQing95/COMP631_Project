Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went here on a Friday night with no reservation. Although the place was crowded, we were able to be seated immediately at the bar. I highly recommend the chorizo wrapped dates and the shrimp with lardon, both on the pintxos portion of the menu. Although these were bite sized, they were both packed with flavor!
