Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Standard and nothing noteworthy about this brunch. The menu was pretty basic and didn't have anything inventive on their menu. I had high hopes due to the reviews, but found the food to be average similar to diner fare. I am visiting from the Bay Area where we take brunching very seriously. i was excited to see what Chicago had to offer but left disappointed. I have had some excellent meals in Chicago and have to believe there is better brunch to be discovered here.
