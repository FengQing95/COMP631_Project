Art Institute of Chicago////There's so much to love here, it makes my brain explode.  Renaissance paintings from all over Europe?  Check.  Medieval armor?  Check.  Paintings and sculptures from Asia?  Check.  Contemporary installations?  Yep, they've got that too.  And ancient art, American art, Native American art, and on and on.
