Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The butter crust that Lou is famous for was dry, hard, and bland. The cheese hardened pretty quickly and did not have the yummy gooey-ness that makes pizza so great. The sausage in the pizza was way too much! I hate to complain about too much of a topping but it was basically a meat patty layered on top of the cheese.
