Little Goat Diner////At first glance this place seemed like a funky, overpriced diner. While I walked away thinking that as well, I'm pretty okay with it after having the food! We started off with a few rounds of drinks (again, overpriced, but it's a trendy restaurant in a trendy area) and then started ordering. I got the Los Drowned, some sort of braised beef sandwich with pickled onions and peppers, cheese, spicy mayo, and a ton of au jus. Wow. This sandwich was amazing. Everything went really well and the meet so SO juicy and tender. I had a side of the fries, which are seasoned perfectly and cooked just how I liked them. I sampled some other things, including the cheese grits (not that good) and the mac and cheese (SO good). There was a great variety of the food on the menu, and I felt myself going back and forth between a couple different things that sounded great.
