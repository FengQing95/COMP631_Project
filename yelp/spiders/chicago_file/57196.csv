Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is a great group dining spot for tapas and sangria, and live music. The venue is pretty huge, well decorated, and the live music makes you feel like you're in Spain. I went here on an interview dinner on my journey to become a MD, and I think I may have enjoyed myself a little too much here (it was encouraged, and I got the job, don't worry).
