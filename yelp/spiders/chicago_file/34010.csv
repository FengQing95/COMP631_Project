Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////During our trip to Chicago, my husband and I were in the mood for a great steak dinner. Yelpers' reviews of Bavvettes were exceptionally high, and did not disappoint. Our meal was flawless, the ambiance was dramatic and stunning, the service was polite, friendly, and professional. We each ordered the Traditional Filet Mignon, and agree they were the absolute best steaks we ever had. We also shared a side of the buttery mashed potatoes and the string beans, both of which were total perfection. I can sum this restaurant experience up in one sentence: Really pricey, but completely worth it. Super enjoyable and delicious from start to finish. Everything is obviously made with care and fine ingredients. If you're looking for a romantic, classy, extravagant, elegant evening, plan a splurge at Bavvettes.
