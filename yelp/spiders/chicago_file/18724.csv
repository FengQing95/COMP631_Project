Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Im from SF. My hubby and i love pizza.  I was so excited to try this place.    We came in 10:45 am.   theres hardly anyone there.  We waited 50mins to get our pizzas and our pizzas  came  out warm .  Im pretty sure our pizzas sitting out for a while.  We ordered Italian combo and classic.  Flavors was ok and service sucks.  Im so disappointed regarding the pizzas.  I would gave 1 star, but my hubby told me to be nice.  Would not go back.
