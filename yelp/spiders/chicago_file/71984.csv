Little Goat Diner////Finally had to hop on here to leave a review for the shitty service. 3 out of 4 times we've been here we've had rude waiters which has made the experience awful. Food is solid, menu is adventurous but there are plenty better with quality food out there. If you like the 'I hate my life so I'm going to take it out on you' service then go here. I will say it doesn't look like they are rude to everyone so you can take that what it is in terms of what kind of 'mold' you have to fit to get good service. I'm officially done with this place, it ruins my mood every time I walk out.
