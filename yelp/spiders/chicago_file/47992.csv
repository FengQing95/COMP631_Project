Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I ordered the shrimp with garlic, olive oil and red pepper flakes thrice. I didn't like the beef empanadas, it lacked taste. The seared lamb loin was really good, enjoyed the pisto manchengo that came with it. The ambience of the restaurant was really fun and inviting. Overall good place for the price. I ate a lot but it was worth it.
