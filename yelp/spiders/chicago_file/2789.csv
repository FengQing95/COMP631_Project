The Purple Pig////Relatively pricey tapas is the name of the game here, but that doesn't mean they aren't delicious. Get the bone marrow like your life depends on it. The richness of that marrow spread on the toast is wonderful. If it's too rich for you, there's some salt that accompanies the dish to help you break it down a bit (and help you achieve your salt bae dreams).
