Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is a review for the gluten free among us. I went to Lou Malnati's to try their (in)famous gluten free pizza. To make the pizza gluten free they substitute a large disk of sausage for the crust. Since hearing about it, I haven't spoken with anyone who actually tried it. I think it's one of those things that sounds interesting, but is a little more than the stomach can handle.
