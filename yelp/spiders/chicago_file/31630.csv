Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I came here on lunch with two of my co-workers. I'm really not a deep dish crust pizza type of gal but one of my co-workers wanted to come here for lunch.Since I didn't want to be a mean girl. I decide to opt in and join my co-workers for lunch.  The décor and whole set up of this plaice is awesome. Cool décor wall display of jersey's and other memorable sports items.  Service is nice and the food is ok. We all order the lunch special which comes with a personal deep dish pizza (choice of cheese, cheese & sausage, or cheese & pepperoni for $9.95. Any other ingredients is charged an extra $1.15.  Your choice of a side salad or cup of soup.  But the only soup on the menu is minestrone soup.
