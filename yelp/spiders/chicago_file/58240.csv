Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've only been for happy hour but it is probably one of, if not my favorite, happy hours in the city! Came here with a group of six and we all loved their happy hour tapas and sangria. At $16 a pitcher, there was enough for about six glasses so one for each of us (what an awesome deal!). We went down the list and tried all of here happy hour tapas, which were all delicious.
