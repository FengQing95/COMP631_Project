Art Institute of Chicago////I visited the Art Institute with my husband and our friend Tristan C., a Chicago local. We went on a Thursday at 5, when admission was free for residents. There was a long line to get in, but it went quickly. We only had about an hour and a half before dinner, so we went through the special exhibit and then a lightning tour of the greatest hits, led by Tristan.
