Art Institute of Chicago////The place can be a bit confusing get so definitely grab a map and ask for help from the guide at the entrance before making your routes. I almost opted out on listening to his advice but glad I didn't! I went during the cold season so the garden grounds were closed but it would be a sight to see I'm sure!
