Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our second time to Bavette's, after recommending it many times to others after our first.  Yes, food was great BUT very surprised on how a misstep in prep was handled.  This time I tried the bone-in filet mignon.  Very pricey item at near $70.  Ordered medium-rare.  When it arrived the outside was pure black and very dry.  Cutting in, could barely detect pink and the meat was flavorless and also very dry.  Showed the server, who immediately agreed and after about 7-8 min provided a newly prepped filet perfectly done.  Rest of meal was as good as our expectations, however when we received our nearly $200 check there was not a single concession.  Come on guys...buy me a drink when I have to wait for another attempt by your kitchen at one of your signature dishes...eh?  My wife was polite and waited until I was served, but that meant she ate her lamb colder.
