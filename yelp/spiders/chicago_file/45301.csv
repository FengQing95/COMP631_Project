Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I just don't get the appeal of this place. First of all it's huge and so you feel immediately lost in a sea of diners. Our server was not knowledgable and mispronounced some items on the menu, then soon after ordering totally neglected us. The overall experience is impersonal. To put it simply, this place serves inauthentic, knock-off tapas.
