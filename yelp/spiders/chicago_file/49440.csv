Smoque BBQ////Serves one of the best pulled pork sandwiches I've ever had north of the Mason-Dixon line. A visit to Mississippi back in 2006 introduced me to the heavenly pleasures of Memphis' Leonard's Pit Barbecue and Clarksdale's Abe's Barbecue. I lamented that while Chicago offers plenty of fantastic BBQ (Honey One BBQ, for instance), I'd probably never get a good southern BBQ place in my immediate area. Hooray for Smoque! Besides the fantabulous pulled pork sandwich, the sides are filling and fulfilling. Get the beans and mac and cheese, and end with the cobbler. One tip: order ahead to avoid the long lines on the weekend. Eating at the actual restaurant is fine, but bringing it all back home to enjoy at your peaceful leisure is better.
