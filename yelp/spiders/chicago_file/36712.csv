Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////After finishing the foie gras starter pretty much all by myself, I was full.  And then my petite fillet steak came.  My review of the steak probably isn't fair or accurate, because I was so full, but the steak was mediocre.  On the other hand, the bone marrow was full of rich flavor, buttery goodness.  Yum! Yum!
