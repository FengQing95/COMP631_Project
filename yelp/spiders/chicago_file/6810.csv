Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute of Chicago is an absolute gem. It's one of those museums that will take you several days to really experience everything. I spent a couple hours (which is about my tolerance for museums) and enjoyed most everything I saw. I was surprised to be so impressed by the miniature rooms (think the most intricate dollhouses you've ever seen) as I really expected this to be really boring but was fascinated by the level of detail. The exhibits are really phenomenal as they have a lot of amazing collections with some pieces you'll recognize and some things you might not but come from amazing artists. I bought a membership because that's the only way I'll really be able to appreciate this museum for what it offers and the price is right if you want to come back a couple times in a year. With the right level of membership you can bring guests to which makes a nice activity to bring all the visiting friends and relatives.
