Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The restaurant on Lincoln Ave. in Chicago has excellent take- out service and offers great value on its food. My recent order of an Italian beef sandwich was accompanied by a plentiful cluster of both red and green grapes (my requested substitute for French fries.) he sandwich was juicy, meat tender, and the bread roll was very fresh.Delicious!
