The Purple Pig////Pig's ears aside, my overall experience was great. Although I came in on a busy night, I was able to find a seat at the bar pretty quickly and service was good. I forgot which white wine I ordered (something French), but it was also very good! Overall, this is a restaurant I will return to for the Grilled Octopus, and perhaps to try some other menu items!
