Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////AMAZING pizza! Loved that we were able to put our pizza order in (when we had a 40 minute wait) and walk across the street to a bar while we waited. They texted us when the table was ready, we sat down ordered the cheese bread and a round of drinks(all came within 10 minutes) and as we were finishing the first round the pizza arrived. All perfectly made and great timing! The pizza was awesome, loved the crust! The staff was friendly and inviting. WILL be going back! 5+
