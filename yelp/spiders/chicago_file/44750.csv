Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is a wonderful place to go if you're vegetarian. Maybe not so great for vegans, as my favorite dishes contain cheese or cream, but if you eat dairy then you must (!!!) have some of the Spicy Potatoes. Their gazpacho is wonderful and the Fried Green Peppers are so tasty. Had the red Sangria for the first time last month. A very generous portion for a reasonable price. And can we talk for just a second about the dessert tapas? Heaven!
