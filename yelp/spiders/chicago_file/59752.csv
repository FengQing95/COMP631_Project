Smoque BBQ////They were out of a lot of things that late in the night, but pulled pork is good for me. It was really, really good. I'm no pulled pork expert but it made my tummy happy. On the side I had this tiny baked mac and cheese pastry cup. It was the cutest thing. I love mac Â and cheese but I feel like whenever you order a side of it, its never that good. This one was delicious, with crumbs on top--and so cute! The coleslaw was also phenomenal. Lost of pepper and red onion really gave it that kick.
