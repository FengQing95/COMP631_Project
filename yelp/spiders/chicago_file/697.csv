Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Yes, this place is a bit more 'commercialized' than some of the area diners, but their choice of menu and quality of food is really very good. Loved their omelets and cinnamon roll pancakes. Nice experience overall. Expect to wait a long time if you go on the weekends, but have a latte while you wait and relax.
