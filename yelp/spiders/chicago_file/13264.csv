Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Chicago locals as an FYI we outside of your fine city have been poisoned with what is marketed as Chicago style pizza from something claiming to be Pizzeria Uno and after eating at the original one I am very confused ... did somebody steal the name? Â Because the Pizza there is really good unlike the crap I get here in Virginia and assume the rest of our readers are accustomed to.
