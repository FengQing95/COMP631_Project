Little Goat Diner////I've visited 3 times now for breakfast and have yet to be let down be it by food, service or overall experience. Their coffee is great (locally roasted), the booths are comfy and the menu is nothing short of amazing. I've had the corned beef hash and two omelets of the day, which all were amazeballs. Also, you'll never wait as long as they say you will when you put your name in (bonus).
