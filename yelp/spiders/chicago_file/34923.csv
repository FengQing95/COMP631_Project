Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////You would think of "boeuf" as merely a steak house, but apparently the quality of seafood here stands out from the rest with half the menu being comprised of king crab legs, fresh main lobster and "maudes tower" which my boyfriend and I decided we would try next time we go back (an extreme array of delicious shellfish).
