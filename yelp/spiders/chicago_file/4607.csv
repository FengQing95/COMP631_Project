The Purple Pig////Promptly after, our first shareable entree (half duck) arrived. It was so good!!! At first I didn't think it was plated attractively, but that's because there was a yogurt sauce that blended in with the plate so it looked like the duck was off center. The yogurt balanced out the sweetness of the duck skin. I didn't partake any of the roe.
