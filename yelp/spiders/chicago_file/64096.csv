Smoque BBQ////This place has the best barbecue I have ever had. I love barbecue and I take the drive from Wisconsin at least once a month to come here. It's worth the horrendous traffic. They recently added a seating area outside to double their seating, and they will still be full all the time. I love the sliced brisket, the sausage, the bread pudding. My husband loves the brisket and the pork, the peach cobbler and the beans. You can not go wrong here. EVERYTHING IS AMAZING!
