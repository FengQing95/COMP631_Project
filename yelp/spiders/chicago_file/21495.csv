Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My brother had the classic deep dish. He got the 9 inch and the bartender warned him it would be big. (Since it is a deep dish, and us Texans aren't used to that crazy stuff!) My brother cockily said "We'll see." And he did see. Ate about half of it, took the rest on our flight home.
