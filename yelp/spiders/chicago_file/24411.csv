Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I left my stint in the Midwest about 17 years ago, but remember the Chicago deep dish pizza fondly.  I've never been a huge sausage pizza fan, so instead of the Classic I always ordered the pepperoni in its place.  My husband and I turned to Yelp for a local pizza recommendation and found Lou Malnati's has nearly 3000 reviews and still pulls in 4 stars, so who are we to argue?
