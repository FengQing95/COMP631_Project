Smoque BBQ////The brisket was tenders, subtle hints of smoke throughout and lightly covered with a delicious sauce.  They also include a thick and slightly lighter bbq sauce on the side.  The brisket combined with the thicker sauce was amazing!  The Texas sausage had good flavor and smokiness.  It was as much of a showstopper as the brisket.
