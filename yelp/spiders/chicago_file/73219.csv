Little Goat Diner////But they have a small actual separate vegan menu that includes these delicious magical crumpets and almond milk for my coffee. Fun old timey diner vibe. Its a great place for mixed omni/vegan company. You're omni buddies can get stuff next door while you wait. You will hungrily watch them scarf goodies down.
