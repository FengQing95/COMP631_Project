Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband and I have come back to celebrate our anniversary here twice. This will continue to be our favorite location for special occasions. The food was outstanding, our steaks (my filet and his 22oz ribeye) were made to perfection at a medium plus, per the recommendation of our fantastic server named Brandon. The sides we chose were mashed potatoes and creamed spinach, they were delicious. The blue cheese on the spinach was a plus along with the roasted garlic cloves on the potatoes. The oysters we had for appetizers were tasty however I prefer their East Coast option. Â My rye old fashioned was tasty, however my husband's filthy dirty martini with blue cheese olives was the creme de la creme!
