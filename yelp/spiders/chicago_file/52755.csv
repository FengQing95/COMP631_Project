Smoque BBQ////The fries were a little soggy but that's probably because it was raining and it was carry out with a 20 minute drive home. The beans were delicious but extremely small in quantity, especially compared to the size of the fries, same for the coleslaw. I really with I got half the amount of fries and at least 50% more coleslaw and beans.
