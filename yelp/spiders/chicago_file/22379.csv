Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////What a hot mess!!!! The basil/onion side literally had HUGE chunks of onions I had to scrape off if I had any intentions of speaking to anyone else last night, cheese was scattered and uneven throughout, I mean Wow, how in the hell do you screw that up??? Believe me when I say the Giordano's in my freezer looked 1000% better than that thing. Last part of this useless trip and waste of money, after all of this, we go to the bathroom and there is ONE STALL.
