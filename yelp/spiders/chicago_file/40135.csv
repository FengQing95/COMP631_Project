Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Appetizers: We got the Garlic Shrimp de Jonghe and the Wedge Salad. The shrimp were amazing, the butter/garlic/sherry combination made them very rich and delicious. Our waiter helpfully pointed out that ordering the wedge salad also satisfies the bacon craving, as it comes with some healthy chunks of bacon. The salad was great as well with chunks of blue cheese, egg, and ranch dressing. Although I think the kitchen was a little heavy handed with the dill that day which overpowered a few bites.
