Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////So this was probably the best meal I've had in awhile. We got the pork chop, steak frites, potatoes, creamed spinach and Mac & cheese with bacon. The bacon was divine but profitably a bit gluttonous...in our defense we were starving by the time we got seated. But it's one of the places where you are stuffed but just can't help yourself from taking another bite. It was SOOO good! And the prices were terrible. We order all listed above and I think our bill was $110. Granted we had got drinks and an appetizer at Gilt Bar so that eliminated some extra cost.
