Little Goat Diner////Glad I had a reservation. Got the korean burger, shared fries with a friend and we split the Choco Taco dessert (which, isn't actually a taco). Everything was very good, the korean burger was big and tasty but the kimchi wasn't my cup of tea. Fries were plentiful (as they should be) and the choco taco was good, but hard to eat and not omg-amazing like other yelpers claim. Glad I checked this place out it was adorable and had some really interesting looking plates.
