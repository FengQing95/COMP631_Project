Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's is one of the most famous places to have Chicago deep dish pizza, with several locations. The pizza is made to order, so it was actually at least a 30 minute wait once we were seated for our pizza to arrive to us. In the meantime, we had a caesar salad. We were expecting it to be a small portion, but the salad was huge. It was excellent and we finished the whole thing, which we regretted later as it made us too full for the pizza.
