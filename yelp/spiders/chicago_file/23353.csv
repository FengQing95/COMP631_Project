Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Oh my goodness. First time in Chicago and first time going for deep dish. Stopped in right before heading to the airport to go home and got the lunch special takeout - was super quick, cheap, and THE best pizza I've ever eaten. One personal pizza was enough for lunch and another meal on the plane... was sooo delicious both hot and cold. I usually prefer thin crust and was honestly not expecting much. Wish I'd known better and grabbed two!
