Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////7. The paella was the most disappointing dish, and not the most memorable ending. First, there were 5 of us, and we ordered 2 serving of paella which was more than enough for 5. we only finished 1/2 the dish. If you are getting plenty of tapas, get the smaller portion of paella. The vegetarian paella was not flavorful with mushy vegetables. i was super excited because i usually love it, but I would definitely not order this again and would not recommend this dish.
