Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Stopped in for a late lunch with friends and family. Michael was our waiter. Kudos to the management at this location. My friend was trying to order a thin crust, in my mind I'm like why? This place is known for the deep dish. Our waiter convinced him he was in the wrong place and in a good way convinced him to deep. Can't get a bad meal at this place. One of the best Caesar salads in Chicago, definitely the best salad for a pizza joint. Just all around good experience. Thanks Mike
