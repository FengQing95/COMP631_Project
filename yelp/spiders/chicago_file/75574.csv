Little Goat Diner////Had the Breakfast Spaghetti 'N Clams 'N Crab. It came out to be soupy, which was unexpected. It was pretty much like a spaghetti omelette in a little broth. Very unique but quite odd and somewhat tasty? I didn't taste or see much of the crab, just more of the clams. Favorite part was the strips of bok choy. It was nice that it wasn't a heavy dish.
