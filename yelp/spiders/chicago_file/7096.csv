Art Institute of Chicago////I love, love, love the Art Institute of Chicago, the only one in America that I've been to that compares has been the National Gallery of Art in DC. I'm a big fan of modern American paintings, 1900's abstract stuff, surrealism,  Picasso...  and their collection is really good especially for carrying such an extensive collection of everything else. They also have wonderful special exhibits that come through and I think this summer they are planning to build a whole new wing so that they can display even more of the art they have in storage. If you are visiting Chicago you MUST go to this museum (it's free on Thursday evenings! go 5pm - 8pm on Thursdays!). You won't regret it.
