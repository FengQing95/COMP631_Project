Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After a long day of walking and shopping, we stopped by Lou Malnati's for a deep dish pizza. I ordered a custom one with the Butter Crust deep dish. Be patient because it does take time to make the pizza, I enjoyed people watching as I waited. The pizza came out and it was delicious! I really liked the butter crust, you have to get that! It was a very enjoyable dinner with great service and a nice patio to sit and watch Chicago go by!
