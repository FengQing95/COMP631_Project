Little Goat Diner////Came here for my birthday on a Saturday night. We got there around 9 and were seated right away. Our server was nice and attentive. Our drinks were never empty and we had everything we needed. I ordered a goat patty melt and mac and cheese. The patty melt was good but the mac and cheese was even better. Also, our food got out quickly.
