Art Institute of Chicago////But, if you do nothing else at the AI...you have to go down to the Thorne rooms.  I had never heard of this before and it's possibly my most favorite room in the entire city.  This exhibit is full of dozens of miniature rooms, decorated from a variety of periods of interior design and architecture.  They're incredible and I never even knew they were down there.  It's a history lesson via design with rooms from Europe (France, Great Britain, and Germany) and American rooms.  They look like dollhouse rooms but the level of detail is both fascinating and remarkable.  I could've stayed down there all day.  You HAVE to check that out.
