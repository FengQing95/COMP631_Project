Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I would strongly recommend making a reservation no matter what your party size is because it expedites the time you have to wait. I have come here with a party of three and ended up sitting at the back bar because the wait to seat at a table was much longer than we wanted to wait. I still enjoyed myself nonetheless!
