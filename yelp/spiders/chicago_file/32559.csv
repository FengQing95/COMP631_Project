Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've been to Bavettes twice. The first time I would say 5 stars. Amazing food and service. My last visit was three at best. Hats off to a great bartender who is a true mixologist. Had a couple appetizers including duck terrine and shrimp cocktail. The terrine was ok, needed the jam to bring the flavor. The roasted Tomato salad was good and the side of two large pieces of bacon the best addition.  The steak is where it fell apart. Ordered their signature bone in dry aged ribeye. It arrived like warm at best. Asked for it to be warmer. No one apologized for it being cold, and in fact it almost appeared the server didn't really care or believe us. Came back having been under the broiler.  Was average tasting.  The Pom Frittes were ok. Overall just ok. So I'm unsure if I'll rave as much about it going forward. I love the vibe there. It's warm and inviting. Honestly? Even coming out $8 ice cream would have been a nice I'm sorry for a cold steak. So Bavettes, please rethink how you handle cold food!!!
