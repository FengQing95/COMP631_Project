Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza is very good, the consistency of the sauce is a bit chunky so I recommend asking for additional sauce on your deep dish. Â I tried both cheese and meat pizza here and preferred the meat pizza, the meat complimented the chunky consistency of the sauce better at this restaurant.
