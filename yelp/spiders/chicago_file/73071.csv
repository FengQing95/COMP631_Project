Little Goat Diner////My two friends and I each ordered a main dish and then we ordered a couple of sides to try, as well. I started with the Chocolate Goat's Milk for $3. Personally I would skip this next time as I found it to be a bit grainy and not rich in chocolate. I got this for myself as a little indulgence and I honestly don't think it was worth the precious calories spent.
