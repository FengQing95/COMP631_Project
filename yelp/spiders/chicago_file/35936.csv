Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I had been trying to get reservations here for months.  Reservations were made twice, months in advance, and both times i had to cancel.  My husband and I were then invited at the last minute to go with another couple and we jumped at the chance!  Reservations were for a Saturday night at 7pm and I was so excited. I had heard great things about this place. We arrived a little early for our reservation so went over to the bar to order a few drinks. The mixologist was great! She was very meticulous in making our drinks, asking about the size of the ice and taking special care with the lime rinds that go on the rim of the glass. The Kir Royale was fantastic! We ordered the seafood tower as an appetizer for the table, and the goat cheese. My entrée was the bone in ribeye and we got sides to share.  The elote , creamed spinach, and mashed potatoes were all very good. My steak was cooked to perfection just how I like it, medium rare. The only negative I have about this place, but it is not worth one less star, is the dim lighting downstairs. I asked for an extra candle to be placed on the table but they said they didn't have any. I would still come again. Can't wait.
