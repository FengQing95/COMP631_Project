Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Small plates were served.  Starting with argula salad and bacon wrapped figs.  Chicken and sausage skewers and spicy potatoes with the most amazing aioli accompaniments.  Garlic toast with goat cheese in marinara and stuffed mushrooms.  All very tasty and light since you get a very tiny plate of your own to dine from.   I enjoyed it very much.
