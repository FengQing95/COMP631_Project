Little Goat Diner////Came here on a sunday night with a couple of friends. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted and taken to a table.We started off with the tempura mashed potatoes, and it was absolutely delicious. The pickled vegetables on top added a crunch and sweetness, and the tempura provided a great texture, and then it melts in your mouth. The sauce also adds the perfect amount of acidity. I also ordered the Brandade pork belly benedict, and this was wonderful. A twist on the classic eggs benedict. The kimchi totally works. Will be coming back!
