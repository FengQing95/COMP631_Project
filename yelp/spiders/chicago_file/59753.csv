Smoque BBQ////We ordered our food at the counter and even though the place was jam packed, they sat us right away. A few minutes later we had our food. Even though the atmosphere is hectic (and there were other customers lingering around our table), someone came by to ask us if we needed anything else, how the food is, and then to clear the plates. I really have no complaints. Well, ok, it was a little drafty but I was totally fine.
