Little Goat Diner////Okay, okay... I'll admit it. I've had a dining partner with me on every one of my visits so I've technically split all this and I don't actually have the manly appetite that I've led you to believe I have. In fact, I usually have leftovers so this probably enough food for 3 people, but more importantly, it's exactly the amount of food a person needs to forget about a personal tragedy (Re: spider demons). Amen.
