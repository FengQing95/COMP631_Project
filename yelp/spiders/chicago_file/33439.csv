Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's did the impossible: it achieved a 5/5 on food and drinks IN A TOWN KNOWN FOR GREAT STEAKS AND GREAT STEAK PLACES.  You guys came out swinging for the fences as rookies and hit a grand slam.  I would put the actual steak up there with Smith & Wolinsky, Gene & Giorgetti's, and Chicago Cut.  I always let my server tell me what the chef recommends on anyone cut of steak at a place, and the Classic Chicago cut ribeye was perfectly cooked at medium rare.  It had a healthy sear without being burnt, was tender, and had enough au jus for both the dish and the sides later onward.  If you know your steak, this is one to make time to experience.  The knife was not necessary.
