Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went here for a celebration for a co workers engagement. The staff was very friendly and the 4 of us split the small plates, I was so full off the little that we ordered but I couldn't stop eating! The wine and food was flowing, and the spicy potatoes are to die for. I can't wait to go back! I highly recommend getting a reservation in.
