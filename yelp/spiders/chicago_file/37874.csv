Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. I love to sit downstairs here because the vibe is completely different, the music and ambience is great. My favorites on the menu are the Caesar salad, the lamb chops, the dry aged ribeye and the truffle Mac and cheese. Ive also loved every dessert I've tried, carrot cake is my favorite. I've always had such great service here. Try to make reservations the week before! Extremely busy all the time!
