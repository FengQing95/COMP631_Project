Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our server seemed a bit surprised, but was really nice when we interrupted his greeting to order our entire meal along with a giant pitcher of sangria.  The sangria was delicious.  I was happy with the menu selections as well.  I have spent some time in Spain and it was nice to see some of my favorite tapas on the menu (padron peppers, yum!).  The food was really good and the experience left us feeling great after a disastrous day.
