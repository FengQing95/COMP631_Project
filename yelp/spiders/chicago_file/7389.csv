Art Institute of Chicago//// However, for what it's worth, it has a very easy-to-follow layout, an incredible collection (especially of American art), a section of the museum devoted to Chicago's architectural past, a (permanent?) exhibit on the architecture and design of Garofalo, and an impressive modernist/futurism collection (Mondrian, Brancusi, and Klee, oh my!). I felt like a kid in a candy shop, except I was a kid in a museum. But still giddy.
