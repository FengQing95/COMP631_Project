Little Goat Diner////The food was fantastic - exactly what I would have expected. The service, however, left a lot to be desired. Our server -JP I believe was his name - was absent at best. I had to wait 10 minutes with an empty glass before being offered a refill and my wife actually had to ask for more water. The food was dropped and then he basically disappeared. The whole time i observed him chatting with other customers at the counter and in the service station. I really expected a lot more from a service standpoint. Fortunately, the food was fantastic and I'll definitely be back. If the service is like this again, though, it will be the last time.
