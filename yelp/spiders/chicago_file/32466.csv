Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Tried the small  thin crust spinach, the personal deep dish pepperoni, and the personal deep dish Malnati classic with added pepperoni.  The personal is a decent size for one hungry person it's basically two slices. Personals are only available in the deep dish style pizzas. The small thin crust spinach was good as well. I'd recommend trying this spot out when in the area.
