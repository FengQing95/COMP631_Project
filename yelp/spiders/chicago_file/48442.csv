Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I'm surprised I've never reviewed CBBR before because I'm such a big fan of it! The numerous options are great for foodies and trying things with friends. There are plenty of options for picky eaters as well, if you've got someone with vegetarian/GF type restrictions or who is just plain picky. They do a great job of accommodating large groups as well so if you plan a group outing here it is easily doable!
