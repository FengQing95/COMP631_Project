Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When the pizza finally arrived I've never seen anything like it and it smelled sooo good.. my mouth is watering just thinking about it hahaha so this is what deep dish is. When I first bit into it my taste buds were all over the place with joy. Till this day I don't think I've had a better pizza. When I visit I'll be coming back to this place. Thank you so much for that beautiful memory
