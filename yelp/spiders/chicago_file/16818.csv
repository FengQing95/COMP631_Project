Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The BEST thin crust pizza in the hood!   Everyone talks about the deep dish here, but the real star is the thin crust.  It is light, crunchy and delish.  This location is always busy.  If you are looking for a great atmosphere, you may want to go to the North State Street location in the Gold Coast.  This is all about the food!  The salads are fresh and complement the pizza.  The pepperoni is the best!!
