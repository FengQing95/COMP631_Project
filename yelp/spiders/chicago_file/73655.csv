Little Goat Diner////Bleh. I wouldn't go back. This place is not special and not gourmet. We split the fried pickles and fish tostadas and I feel gross from over fried food. Â There was no real food. It was all breading. My husband got the sloppy joe, which was good, although nothing overly special.
