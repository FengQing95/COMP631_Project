Little Goat Diner////Service was great and the atmosphere was friendly. I came here on a saturday afternoon for brunch with my friends and it was just awesome. Though i arrived a little late i didnt have to wait long for the food to come out. My friends ordered me a bloody mary im not too much of a fan for thay so i ordered something else. I also got the spanish omelette and it was very different from the omelettes ive tried before. Very delicious. Our waiter was also very friendly too.
