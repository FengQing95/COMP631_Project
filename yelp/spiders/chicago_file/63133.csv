Smoque BBQ////My wife and I have been coming here frequently over the last for 4 years.  Their food and service are better than ever.  Not only is the food consistently fantastic but the service is in a class of its own, the service is always wonderful.  You will have a seat at a clean table by the time your food comes, they will clear your plate politely.  We love it here and will continue to come back.
