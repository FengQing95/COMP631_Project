Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Anyhow, we ordered a calamari and two personal pies - the original and the meat. The calamari was standard; nothing terribly interesting beyond that they served it with a shrimp cocktail sauce which was strange and took some adjustment due to the unexpected tartness. I really enjoyed the meat but it reminded me of a casserole; the meat provided an unexpected umami flavor that was lacking in the original, which was composed of tomatoes, spinach, etc. Surprisingly, the crust was crispy but also borderline hard .. a great contrast to the moist meat/vegetables which were meh at best. Warning: portion sizes are huge; two personal pies were sufficient between two people. My partner wasn't impressed by the pies - he mentioned he has had better in Chicago.
