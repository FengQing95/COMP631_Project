The Purple Pig////Words cannot describe the explosion of different flavors from the unique combination of ingredients put together, dishes out and served in this amazing restaurant, tapas style. This is one of those occasions where you look toward the quality, delivery and service of a restaurant, appreciating the depth of love that is poured out on every single plate. That is the purple piiig. This tapas style restaurant is dishing out some awesome small plates! Check out my photos for some of the things I tried. I fee as if my descriptions would not do justice for some of the food I ate. It would be like me leading a boat tour on the Chicago river(which I went on just now btw) and trying to be your guide. I would be saying things like "that building is tall, that building is black" instead of explaining the influences behind Art Deco, etc etc
