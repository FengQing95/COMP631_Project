Smoque BBQ////My favorite item is the St. Louis Ribs.  They are meaty and tender, with a great crust.  The peppery (not sweet) sauce really complements the ribs well.  The french fries are some of the best I have ever had in Chicago - crispy and perfectly seasoned.  The macaroni & cheese is fine, but not as exciting as the ribs and fries.
