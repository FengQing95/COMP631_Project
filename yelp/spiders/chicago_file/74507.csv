Little Goat Diner////Service is good but not over the top which is why I docked off one point.  Other than that, I would definitely recommend the Little Goat Diner to anyone who visits Chicago & really want to try Girl & the Goat.  If brunch was this good, can ya imagine how great dinner would be? :D
