The Purple Pig////The purple pig was such a interesting place and I was glad to be able to try it. The crispy pig's ear was indeed crispy and after I took the picture I sliced the yolk open and mixed it with the pigs ear and kale. To be honest my favorite thing about this dish surprisingly was the kale and I'm not a huge veggie guy. The bone marrow was cool to eat because you get a piece of bread, add a little bone marrow on and spread it around the bread then add a pinch of salt that they provide you and a few herbs on top. I could probably do without the capers that they provide for this dish, but make sure to add some of the greens to cut out the fat from the bone marrow. The chicken thigh kebabs were huge and served with a tzatziki sauce. I thought the skin on top was too salty for me. The fried smash potatoes on the bottom of the kebabs were delicious though. I like the idea of what this place is trying to do and I would honestly come back and try other things they have to offer!
