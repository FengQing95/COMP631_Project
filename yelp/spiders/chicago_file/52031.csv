Smoque BBQ////After seeing this place featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, was interested to see what kind of 'que this place served up. The disgusting pigs we are, we went here to check it out after already eating dinner (we were in the area!). The line to order was a mile-long and I almost wanted to leave, but the tantilizing aroma of smokiness clung to me. After a 20minute wait, we went with the sliced brisket and half rack of baby back/half rack of St Louis ribs with fries and beans. It was a tough ride home given how delish everything smelled despite a full stomach. When we finally got back, the food was fantastic. The brisket was awesomely tender and the ribs were soft and juicy. The bbq sauce was also very tasty. I ain't no southern gal but this place done BBQ right. A must try.
