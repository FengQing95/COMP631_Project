Smoque BBQ////This is a neighborhood gem. Best pulled pork and tender beef brisket. The mac and cheese, I wish the little round cup it comes in was bigger as it's deliciously cheesy. The platter is the best choice since you get beans, slaw, mac 'n cheese and choice of meat and very full by the time you're done.
