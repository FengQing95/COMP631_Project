Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Great menu selections, yummy coffee, cute interior, and great service! We had breakfast on a busy Sunday morning and the wait was about an hour, but it was well worth it!  I got the Espanola Omelet, which was so flavorful, and well prepared!  My husband and friends also enjoyed their meals immensely!  The specialty pancakes coming out of the kitchen also looked decadent!  Despite how busy it was the service did not suffer, as our waitress kept our mugs full, and checked on us often.  I will definitely be back on our next visit :-)
