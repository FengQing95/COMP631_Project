Smoque BBQ////Value - way overpriced. The sit-down restaurant prices with the quick-service atmosphere are a big mismatch. Probably the reason they can get away with it is their location. They aim for, "you-get-what-you-pay-for," but the reality is, "the masses are asses and dumb enough to buy what we're selling." Rich people are welcome here.
