The Purple Pig////It was my first time visiting Chicago. Thankfully, I was with my best friend who had been there before. With her we experienced some first time tourist activities like taking a river tour of the local architecture, checking out the largest Starbucks Reserve in the country and just enjoying the comfortable Chicago weather, which at this time, was not too cold.
