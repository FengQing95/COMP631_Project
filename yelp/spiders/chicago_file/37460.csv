Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Anyways, 3 stars for this fine establishment because of the crappy service we received here. Server started off very friendly and interactive, but drinks literally took 25 minutes to arrive. It took us 3 hours to order, eat, and then get our check. It's one thing if it was a party of 6-10 people but this was a party of 3. No reason it should've ever taken this long and they weren't even slam packed busy.
