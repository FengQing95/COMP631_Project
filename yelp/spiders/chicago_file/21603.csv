Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Food is worth four stars, but we had an issue being seated. There were two parties of 14. They seated us and realized we were the wrong group and asked us to get up, go outside and wait longer. This wouldn't have been that big of an issue had it been handled a little more graciously. It was a bit harsh and without an apology. That being said, Lou Malnati's has a warm & inviting atmosphere, great pizza, and our server Brandon did an excellent job making sure we were taken care of during our meal.
