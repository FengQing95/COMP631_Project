Smoque BBQ////I had the 1/2 & 1/2 pulled pork and sliced brisket with cole slaw, fries, and beans.  Don't worry, I had no intention of eating all of that, but I wanted to try it all.  The pulled pork and brisket were both very good, either would make a fantastic sandwich.  The cole slaw and fries were also good.  Something just wasn't quite right about the beans though, they were too sweet I think.  Skip the beans, you won't miss 'em.
