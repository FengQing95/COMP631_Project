Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba a few times over the years, but it's fitting to review it now because it wasn't until recently that I noticed how sizable the space was. I've always sat towards the front of the restaurant and didn't pay that much attention...the tables are still small as heck though. Good thing that the servers are typically quick to pick up used plates because there's not a lot of room to place the various tapas that you will undoubtedly order.
