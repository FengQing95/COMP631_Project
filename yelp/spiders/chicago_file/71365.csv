Little Goat Diner////I have heard great things about Little Goat so I came in with high expectations. I had the Bull's Eye french toast. I was not impressed. It was basically average french toast and average fried chicken together with some special syrup. For me there was just no complexity to the flavor dynamic. You can find something similar to this for less else where. If price isn't really a factor for you then I would say give it a try maybe.
