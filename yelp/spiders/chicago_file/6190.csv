The Purple Pig////This place was a total black horse for our group of San Francisco Bay Area tourists. The ambiance, service, and food were ABSOLUTELY incredible -- I'm still dreaming about the duck and squid ink tagliatelle. We had made reservations and were seated immediately. Our waiter let us know that most of the plates were intended to be shared and will be served as the kitchen completes them -- so family style! We were able to try a lot of dishes this way!
