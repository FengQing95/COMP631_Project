Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Had a great time. Good service, busy on Thursday night. We split two personal pizzas and still had two slices left over lol. The servers were fast and friendly. The place had a good atmosphere. There is a call ahead/text(?) number that lets you skip the line. We didn't do that and it was fine.
