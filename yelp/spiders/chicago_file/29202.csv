Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We showed up at the perfect time, we walked in and were immediately seated! The staff was honest with the time it would take for everything which I have never experienced in a restaurant of any kind which was sweet. Being from the south, we don't really eat deep dish so we had to try it while visiting Chicago and were told to try Lou Malnati's. The food was amazing. We shared a small Malnati Chicago Classic and a Chocolate Chip Pizza. I have never been happier to be so full!
