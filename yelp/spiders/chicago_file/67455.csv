Little Goat Diner////The food here does not disappoint. The service however needs more. We waited over 15 minutes before even being greeted and offered water. That should be immediate after being sat. Yes, it's busy, reservations are a must... But for being that busy the crew should be moving. All the servers just seemed to mosey around, while bus boys ran. Get it together! You are a server, you should be running around at a fast pace! Plus, the attitude could go. Good food, bad service.
