The Purple Pig////this place really did live up to the hype! I came here with two others and were able to be seated within ten minutes - which was very lucky. The staff were all so attentive even though it was incredibly crowded. Even though you may have to share at ling tables it's not too bad and there's definitely enough arm room. I loved all of our dishes but especially the crispy pig ear with kale and an egg. Also the broccoli was very very good.
