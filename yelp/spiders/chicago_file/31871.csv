Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is merely speculation, but I am pretty sure our pizza was frozen. We ordered a sausage, pepperoni, onion, and green pepper pie. Our server said it would take extra time to cook with the extras on it. We didn't care. (We're wild and crazy) When our pizza arrived the pepperoni, onion, and peppers were cooked on top and the sausage inside. The sausage itself was one thin patty and the diameter of the pizza. It was weird, to say the least.
