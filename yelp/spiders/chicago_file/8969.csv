Art Institute of Chicago////The only negative of my experience was that several of the employees at the museum did not like how close we were to some of the art to answer clues for the scavenger hunt- and they yelled instead of politely asking us to move away. Perhaps they don't like the scavenger hunt people- and perhaps the scavenger hunt company needs to change some of their clues- but overall, a great day at the Art Institute!
