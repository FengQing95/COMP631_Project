Art Institute of Chicago////$18 well worth it.  This is probably the second best art museum I've been to (I've been to a fair share) behind the Louvre, but this is still awesome nonetheless.  There is art for everyone (even for you ultra modern contemporary types yuck (action painting?  blank canvases?  multi block colored canvases???).  I loved the new modern wing (Dali, Tanguy, Chagall)...it was ridiculously nice.  It's huge - I could spend a few days in here.  If I lived in Chicago, I'd def be a member here.
