Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I haven't eaten so well and so much in a long long time. This place was amazing! If you enjoy Spanish food and sangria drop everything and head over to Cafe Ba Ba Reeba!! There menu offers many traditional Spanish Tapas and sangria on tap! Choose from Sangria flavors like: Peach, Blackberry and Mango. The place was packed and the wait was still on when we left at 11pm. Make a reservation as early as you can as they fill up fast. Tapas are a more pricey food anywhere, so expect to pay a little more than you would at a typical restaurant. But you get what you pay for here. The food was incredible and the service was good too. Don't miss this gem while you are in Chicago!
