Art Institute of Chicago////It simply amazes me that these artists have so much talent.  When I was a kid, I took a bunch of classes- oil painting, pottery, you name it.  Frankly, I sucked at it.  I guess I didn't have a "vision" or maybe it's just because I was just destined to be a fantastic Yelp reviewer (seriously).
