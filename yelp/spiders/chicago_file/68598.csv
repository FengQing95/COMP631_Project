Little Goat Diner////I love that they take ur number down and text u when ur table is ready, bout time. We were seated in about 20 mins on an early sat evening, so that was great! We wanted to get everything, so hard to narrow it down. Hubby got the Los drowned braised beef sandwich- sooooooooo good! And I got the bulls eye French toast- mmmm mmm! We also tried the tempura mashed potatoes and the fried pickles and onion rings. Oh wait and the cinnamon roll. Yeah we over ordered, judge away world, we work out hard for our food!!! Â Everything was delicious. I actually think I like little goat a tad bit better than girl and the goat?! I cannot wait to come back!!!!!
