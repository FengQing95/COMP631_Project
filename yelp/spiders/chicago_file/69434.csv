Little Goat Diner////the omelette they have that is bacon flavored cream cheese is great. The garnish they put on it complements the crispy onion the put on top as well. The french toast is also excellent good combination of sweet and egg that I have never tasted before in my life. Would recommend this to anyone coming to chicago.
