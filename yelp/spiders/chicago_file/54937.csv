Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We would have had more drinks, more tapas and definitely dessert, but no one came back to ask.  It is a forgotten part of LEYE and it's sad because we can see the servers who have been here since the beginning and we know how dedicated they are.  The younger ones are so blase and uninformed about service.  Boo.  Just no.
