Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The best tapas place I've been to in Chicago. The seafood paella and calamari is really good. White Peach Sangria - can't go wrong with that. Love the atmosphere & how much energy there is. The waitstaff is incredibly welcoming. They have cool paintings on the walls of what looks to me like a modern day Spanish Prince. Really great time and experience; would highly recommend it.
