Art Institute of Chicago////I am a member of the Art Institute of Chicago, and I just wish I could go more often. I love to go after work on the late-hours day, as it is less busy than during the weekends. The permanent collection is wonderful and diverse, including the great Impressionist selections, too many famous artworks to mention, and peculiarities like collections of miniature rooms and paperweights. Check for blockbuster shows that require special ticketed entry. Check out the gift shop and take a photo of the lions.
