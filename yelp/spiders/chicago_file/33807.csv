Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I rarely give 5 stars. It's rare you truly feel that you got what you paid for. I've been to Bavettes a few different times. I most recently took a friend who was in town from NYC. We had a couple of ribeyes and the steaks were seasoned perfectly. Taste was great and they came out at the desired temps. You must order the bacon here, it's life changing. Also the sweet potato is off the charts amazing. Â I really don't have a bad thing to say about this place. For that reason...5 stars
