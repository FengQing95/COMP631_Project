Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Atmosphere : to me, I felt I was in a mid-century downtown hotpot serving the best food to the most relevant people. This is not an arrogant statement, but is merely to show that in Bavette's, one feels more than good vibe, they feel a part of something as if a part of the "in crowd". Dim lit leather booths, long stained wood and glass bar and rubbed Chicago brick along the back wall. Small details of rugs, candles cut into the brick wall for step lighting, etc.
