Art Institute of Chicago////The visitor guide is very practical - if you're pressed for time, there is a must-see guide of the essentials you can cover in an hour listed on the back of the guide.  There are also free smartphone apps you can download for guided tours and information about special exhibits.  The special exhibits are amazing - I loved the recent one on Rene Magritte.  One of my favorite permanent exhibits are the Thorne Miniature Rooms.  Located in the lower level, these intricately designed rooms from different periods in different countries take viewers through a progression of architecture, culture, fashion, and design.  Even the landscaping from the windows is included.  The mini-me inside me was impressed.
