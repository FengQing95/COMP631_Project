Art Institute of Chicago////I've been to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  I've been to the Smithsonian and the National Portrait Gallery.  And I have to say that the Art Institiute far outshines them!  On my recent trip to Chicago, I came here by myself and totally immersed myself in this place!  The Art Institute has a large collection from the Impressionists to Monet, but what I really like is their American Art collection, which I think is second to none.  I particularly liked the decorative arts section on the first floor, near the Columbus Drive exit.  I was interested in how the arts pertain to everyday living.
