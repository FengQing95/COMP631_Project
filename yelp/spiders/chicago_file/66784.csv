Little Goat Diner////Working in the loops offers a lot of opportunities to try new places.  Yesterday, I had the opportunity to try this spot out on my lunch hour.  The staff was very friendly and greeted us right away.  The menu is filled with a nice variety of food choices. I decided to go out on the limb and try the Fish Tostados and I'm soo happy that I did. The fish was cooked to perfection and the shallot aioli . chickpea 'n onion salad . harissa vinaigrette complemented the fish perfectly.  There are so many items on the menu that I can't wait to try on my future visits. So many things sound delicious, such as the Grilled Cheese which is smoked gouda & mont amore cheese, sounds soo yummy! There is also a variety of sweets, salads, and breads that I'm hoping to try in the future.  This spot is definitely on my list to enjoy a nice meal anytime of the day in a great location.
