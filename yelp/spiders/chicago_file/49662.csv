Smoque BBQ////Very good BBQ. This place is very good. They have two kinds of ribs. Everything is probably terrible for you which makes it all the better. It's very busy but the time I went we where able to get a seat right away. They won't let you sit down until you order so it keeps people from hogging all the tables and is first come first serve. It's not too expensive and everything I had I liked. Great place.
