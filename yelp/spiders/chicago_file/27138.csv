Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm not a huge fan of deep crust pizza in general, but this is the place for authentic Chicago Deep Dish pizza. I've had Giodarno's in the past, but their deep dish is even thicker than Lou Malnati's which I think is too much. Lou Malnati's has the perfect amount for a thick crust.
