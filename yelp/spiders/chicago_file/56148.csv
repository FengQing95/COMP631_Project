Smoque BBQ////A couple days before I had to leave Chicago....we stopped by here.  And WOW.... was it frikkin DELICIOUS!!  We had the pulled pork.... everyone in our group chose the pulled pork.  The place was packed so since our friend lived only a couple streets away, we took a couple bags back to her place and began to stuff our face!
