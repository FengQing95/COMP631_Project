Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The service takes a while (maybe 45 minutes to bake) so don't come starving hah. Otherwise, when your pie comes...enjoy the smells, take a bite and enjoy the deliciously flavored marinara sauce and cut into the sausage patty the pie has. The crust is just a perfect thickness. SO SO good.
