Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So disappointed!  After hearing a bunch of reviews about how this is THE place for deep dish pizza in Chicago, I was really let down.  Maybe because it was overly hyped and I expected too much.  We tried the Lou (fresh spinach, mushrooms and sliced tomatoes covered with a blend of mozzarella, romano and cheddar cheese) and the Deluxe (Cheese, sausage, mushrooms, onions and green peppers).  I felt the pizzas were sort of watery and I couldn't quite figure out what was wrong.  I think the flavors just weren't strong enough?  We did spring for the buttercrust which was pretty good - I usually never eat the crust, but I liked it here.
