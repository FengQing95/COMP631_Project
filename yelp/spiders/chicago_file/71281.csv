Little Goat Diner////We were seated at the communal table and its not close quarters where you don't feel like you are sitting on top of each other or sitting too close to odd family members at Thanksgiving. :). The only thing I did not like was this douche bag who was not in our party but seated next to us  thought because we were at a communal table felt like every time our waiter came to make sure that my friend and I were ok or  needed something that he felt it was an opportunity to talk over us and make sure he got what he needed from our server. The interiors are modern but not too minamalistic where you feel like you are eating in an empty room....the lighting was warm and inviting.
