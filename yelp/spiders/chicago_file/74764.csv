Little Goat Diner////Cocktails at 9:30 on a Sunday?  You bet!  My friends opted for a carafe of mimosas, but I was too enthusiastic about the cocktail list and ordered the "Backyard BBQ," which was refreshing, strong, and well made.  The cocktail list is much longer than what's on the Little Goat website (although that too is lengthy!)
