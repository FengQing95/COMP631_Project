Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////As far as the food, it's ba ba reeba, so you know it's got to be good. They have classic brunch options, items from their regular menu, and breakfast pinxtos for those who can't make up their mind. My favorite has to be the french toast, which is saying a lot because usually I'm not a fan.
