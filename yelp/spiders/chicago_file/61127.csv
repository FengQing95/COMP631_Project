Smoque BBQ////I got enough food to be stuffed, with enough brisket left over to make a sandwich the next day, and the grand total was about $20.  I'll go back to try the sausage and the chicken.  BTW, I went right as they opened at 11 on a Saturday and got street parking and a table very easily.  Service was prompt and friendly as everyone has said.
