Little Goat Diner////Fantastic brunch, with a separate vegan menu! The vegan menu here has a great variety, including everything from interesting brunch items to burgers to dinner entrees and drinks. I got the vegan crumpets, which were fantastic. More along the lines of a beignet, served with gooseberries and maple syrup. So flavorful and delicious. The hash browns were also excellent, and a huge portion for the price.
