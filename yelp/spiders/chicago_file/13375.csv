Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place has very good pizza. My wife, daughter, and myself ordered the Chicago classic and it was delicious. The crust was so good and the sauce had chunks of tomatoes that really added to the flavor. My daughter is not a fan of sausage but she loved the sausages on the classic pizza. The place itself is not that roomy, but the atmosphere is classy for a pizza restaurant, I also loved the sports memorabilia that's on the walls. Even though the place is nice and the food is good, I have one complaint, it took forever to have our water refilled. I mean forever, I became extremely thirsty. But it was pretty busy, and the waitress was very nice, I loved her attitude. Besides the water complaint everything else was great.
