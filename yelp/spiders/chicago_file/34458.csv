Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bad service and food is not that great. We were a party of 4. They sat us at the tiniest table when the restaurant was not full. We ordered drinks and after a few minutes the host told us we couldn't have our drinks until we had some food. I never heard of this before. Everyone else in the restaurant had their drinks before food. The burger I had tasted like garlic and pepper and so did my sisters meatloaf. My other sisters steak was fatty and tough our friend had the steak sandwich and the bread was super hard. It was like a sandwhich made with croutons. Go to Tavern On Rush or a few doors down to Kinzie Chophouse. WAY BETTER FOOD, DRINKS , AND SERVICE
