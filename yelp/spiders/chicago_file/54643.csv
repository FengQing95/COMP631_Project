Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////A happy hour MUST. I highly recommend coming for reduced bites and a chance to try some new things with very low cost risk. The sangria is obviously delicious and also discounted during happy hour! Make sure to get there early to scope out a spot, as it can get pretty crowded. Worth the wait though!
