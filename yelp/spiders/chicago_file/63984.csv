Smoque BBQ////I liked their baby back ribs - cooked right and tasty, but were not fall off the bone. The St Louis ribs were rather dry and tough. Their Memphis sauce is average. The brisket chili, mac n cheese and cornbread were all good. Their coleslaw is the best in town and not made with mayonnaise! It reminded me of red tangy coleslaw of my home state NC where BBQ is a religion.
