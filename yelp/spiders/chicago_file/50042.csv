Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great evening - would highly recommend spicy tomato with goat cheese tapas, garlic shrimp, chorizo wrapped dates, burrata, Brussels sprout salad - we also had the classic red sangria and all thought it was delicious! We had the lamb, hangar steak and a chimichurri pork that all were a lot more well done than our preference and would probably not get the next time we go! Waitress was amazing and overall experience was delightful - cannot wait to visit again!
