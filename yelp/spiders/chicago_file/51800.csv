Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been here twice. The first time was fine and this most recent time was worse. I thought the sangria was quite watery tasting in both visits. More recently we got a pitcher of the passionfruit one, and you could barely taste the passionfruit flavor. We started with a few tasty dishes; a peri peri chicken and an assortment of sausages and both of those were quite good. Afterwards things went downhill. The patatas braves were so coated in seasoning I was afraid to inhale while chewing, for fear of choking on the spices. The potatoes were cut big, too, so you got an over-seasoned crust and and then a lot of underwhelming bland potato inside. The brussel sprout salad was severely lacking acidity, a steak dish we got was tough and chewy, and this might be pretentious, as most Americans don't know good olive oil, the the oil that came on the table for the bread was rancid.
