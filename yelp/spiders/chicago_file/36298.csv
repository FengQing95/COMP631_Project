Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Not that this place needs another rave review, but WOW.  It's as good as it gets for steak in Chicago.  The atmosphere is so sleek and classy but welcoming at the same time.  I've never had a bad bite of food here.  Every steakhouse I go to, I compare it to Bavette's, and Bavette's always wins.  I just wish I could afford to come here weekly.
