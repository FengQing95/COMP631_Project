Little Goat Diner////After two more minutes of debate, I ventured back to the burger menu. After sampling the goat chili, I decided on the Kilgus Goat burger, cooked medium. I had it done "All American," which was simple lettuce, tomato, pickles, onion, special sauce, and American Cheese. I had them hold the latter two ingredients, because I hate mayo, and every special sauce has mayo, and American cheese is okay, but I didn't feel like it would have made my burger any better. Just trying to be a bit health conscious! The All American came with a sesame seed bun, but I decided on the potato bun because I asked my waitress and she really did a poor job explaining the options to me. Oh well, the potato bun ended up better than the sesame seed bun would have been. Â Along with my burger, I decided to order some of their sauteed vegetables. On the online menu, it stated sugar snap peas, but it actually ended up being sauteed vegetables, which featured mostly asparagus, radish slices, a small amount of peas, and it was topped with crispy onions. The veggies were very good. Just tender enough but not wilted. Kudos on those!
