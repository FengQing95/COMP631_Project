Smoque BBQ////I'm not going to even bother writing a review - the 500+ reviewers who have already raved about Smoque have said it all. Service was good - the order line moved fast last Saturday around 12:30 pm. Seating was plentiful at that time. I had the brisket and yes it was the best brisket I've ever had. A signature Chicago experience, not to be missed.
