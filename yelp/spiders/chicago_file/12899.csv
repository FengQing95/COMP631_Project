Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It was awesome! great taste; sausage was very good and ingredients tasted very fresh.not great but good.the sausage was a whole entire thin layer on top so every bite had sausage.we decided against a starter and i was regretting it about 20 minutes into the wait; but once the food came out i was glad we had decided against it! deep dish pizza is so filling!my only complaint was that the hostess sat our party of three at a two top booth.never had deep dish pizza before so this was a nice change.we came around lunch time and the place is super homey.we ordered a mule (custom with triple sec) and goose ipa for drinks and got the classic deep dish pizza from the restaurant and really enjoyed it! i thought it was nice how they warned us that the deep dish would take 40 minutes and we in return ordered some more beers to enjoy the wait.ended up covering the pizza bill.the pizza came straight out of the oven so it was nice and hot.food:i ordered the personal classic; which came with lean sausage; cheese; and tomato sauce on a &#34;buttercrust.
