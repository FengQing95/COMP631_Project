Little Goat Diner////We arrived around 10:20am on a Saturday morning and were promptly seated at one Â of the last open two tops; soon afterwards people had to cue for a table (Little Goat is already extremely popular and likely will remain a hot venue for the foreseeable future). The menu rocks; breakfast is served all day and has extremely tasty options that are fit for foodies, but also several dishes that would appeal to those with more vanilla palates. There is a nice mix of savory and sweet options. My biggest problem was that so many dishes called out to me that I was racking my brain trying to choose my entree; I was pleasantly surprised that our server (Bess) already had such good command of the menu as we asked questions with the restaurant being so new and having a vast array of options. You would never know this was a new restaurant; service was friendly and attentive despite a full house and food was delivered fairly promptly. I wound up ordering the Breakfast Spaghetti n' Clams which was outstanding! It was fun having spaghetti for breakfast and it was served topped with clams, bacon, bok choy, parmesan cheese and soaking in a delicious sauce. I was in heaven.
