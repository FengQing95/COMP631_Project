Little Goat Diner////Parathas Burrito: really great. However, it did not taste like breakfast food, which personally I do not mind but I know some do.  It also was not exactly a burrito.  It was an indian bread folded over with eggs and cheese on the inside and topped with a salad.  I also wish it had more of the orange sauce that was provided. I would recommend this for lunch even since they serve breakfast all day.
