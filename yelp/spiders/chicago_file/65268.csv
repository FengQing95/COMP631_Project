Smoque BBQ////So consistent, always fantastic and pleasant.  The service is great...a friendly host shows the way once you're in the door...The sliced brisket is succulent but not too fatty.  The fries are as good as any places better known for fries.  The buns make the difference too.  And the Mac and cheese, and the pulled pork are tops!  I have to admit, I have never even tried the ribs!! Someday I will.  It's all top shelf bbq!!
