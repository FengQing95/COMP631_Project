Little Goat Diner////Three of us headed to Little Goat for a little guy-time at about 8:15 pm on a Friday night.  It was hopping when we arrived, and we expected the hour-long wait.  We made our way over to the crowded bar and found a nice little plat of real estate to park ourselves for a few beers.  That beer selection is small, but well done... and I supose large for a "diner".  I stuck with the Perrenial Farmhouse ale for the pre-game drinks.
