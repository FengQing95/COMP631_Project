Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We dined at Bavettes a couple months ago and had a spectacular experience. On the first trip there, it was last minute so we couldn't get a reservation other than at 9:15 pm, but the server was very attentive, food was phenomenal and the experience/ambiance couldn't be beat. We raved about Bavettes to all our friends, and told everyone that the 22oz dry aged prime ribeye was possibly the best steak in chicago (as I mentioned in my previous review).
