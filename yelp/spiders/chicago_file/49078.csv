Smoque BBQ////My mouth waters just thinking about Smoque...best bbq in the city. The pulled pork is amazing, and the mac & cheese is to die for.  We've been coming here since they opened a few years back, and every meal has been amazing.  The service is always great, and the owner is usually around talking to customers.  It's pretty busy now that everyone knows about this place, so the wait is typically an hour, even for carryout.  But the food is definately worth the wait! Yum!!!
