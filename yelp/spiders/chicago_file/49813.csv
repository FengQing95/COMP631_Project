Smoque BBQ////My viewpoint on Smoque is that it's just another BBQ place full of yuppies, many dining on their allowances or their student loan proceeds.  If Smoque's owners could just pony up the money to rent a larger place with a decent seating area, then things would look and be much better.  One has to spend something to make something.
