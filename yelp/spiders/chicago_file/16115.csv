Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The Good- everything I tasted was delicious, I had mozzarella sticks, cheddar cubes, and the pepperoni pizza. The fried items were hot, fresh and not greasy, and the marinara that came with was very good. My favorite though was the pizza. The crust was buttery and crispy-somewhere between a biscuit and pizza crust, the cheese was plentiful and had that nice stretchy factor, the pepperoni was tasty, a little spicy and the sauce was great-not too heavy, lightly seasoned and just the right amount. My dining partners really enjoyed everything. The location was perfect for us-not too far from parking.
