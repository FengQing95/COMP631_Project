Little Goat Diner////Machos nachos ($14) were described as a life changing experience by a friend. Yes, these nachos came in an enormous portion, and yes, these nachos were very, very good - especially the puffy, crunchy house-made chips. But these nachos were also a bit too much. I could've done without the heaps of cheese and sour cream, and the BBQ sauce from the made the chips soggy very fast. On the other hand, the pickled onions and peppers were amazing with the pulled pork. I'd call them the best nachos I've had, but that bar is set pretty low, and I think this is a case where less is more!
