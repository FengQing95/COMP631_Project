Little Goat Diner////Popped in for a simple breakfast with my friend. I wanted something healthy but then again not (I was conflicted because everything sounded so perfectly delicious- it didn't help that we sat right by the kitchen so could see every item that people were ordering) so I left my decision to Yelp! I decided to read the first review that popped up and get the same thing the last reviewer mentioned. So I ended up getting the breakfast paratha burrito! I'm Indian and parathas are an Indian thing. It didn't disappoint, the black bean corn salad on top was the perfect amount of healthy I wanted and the paratha was stuffed with two perfectly cooked eggs. Only thing I wished was that it had more of an Indian kick to it which would've brought the flavors full circle, which Is why I rate it at 4
