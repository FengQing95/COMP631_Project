Little Goat Diner////Sign up for the newsletter, and you'll get emailed about a lot of awesome specials and events, including special rooftop nights during the summer. They'll occasionally have an open to the public rose tasting, or beer tasting, with special food pairings -- the whole experience very reasonably priced (if not priced by the rose flight, with complimentary food bites). Not a lot of people know about this so it feels fun and intimate, like you're part of the Goat family. Plus, if you're an Izard fan, you're likely to spot her there from time to time.
