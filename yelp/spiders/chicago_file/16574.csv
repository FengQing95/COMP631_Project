Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Comparing the two, both have cornbread consistency crust and pattie sausage-style pizza. However Gino's sausage goes down slooooowww.. Like you can just hear the heartburn as you digest it. and the crust is thicker (i.e more fattening). Lou's sausage is not as heavy and the crust is so friggin good, I eat the entire slice of pizza.
