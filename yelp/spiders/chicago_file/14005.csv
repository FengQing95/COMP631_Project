Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I just moved to the block where their Evanston restaurant is and was looking forward to trying Malnati's for the first time.  I shared a salad and a pizza with two friends; the amounts were just right, but I was disappointed in both.  The salad was fairly tasteless and the vegetarian pizza, though the crust was fabulous, was not really all that good.   I'll try the sausage one next and hope its better.
