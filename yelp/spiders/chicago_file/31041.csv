Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I came here with a group of three and got a medium half classic/half lou pizza. The crust and the topping are pretty good, but I think deep dish pizza probably just isn't my thing. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind unhealthy food in general, but I think the particular mix of cheese and bread was too much for me. Just too dense and I felt gross before I felt full. I'd recommend this place if you like deep dish, but if you just want to try it because you are in Chicago, maybe share a smaller serving with other people and get other food as well.
