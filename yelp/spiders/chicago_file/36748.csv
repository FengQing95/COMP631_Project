Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is our most favorite restaurant!  Just celebrated our 30th Anniversary there this past Saturday evening.  Not only was the food absolutely amazing but with the incredible service, kindness, and joy, with which we were served from Sally and Michael - it made it the most extraordinary experience!  Thank you both - we were showered with love and laughter and so much deliciousness!  You're the BEST!  Can't wait until our next visit!
