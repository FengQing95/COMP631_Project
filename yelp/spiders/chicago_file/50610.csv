Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great food, atmosphere and service! We went for brunch. I'm a vegetarian but still felt overwhelmed by the options. We used Yelp for a free dessert which was great! Make reservations as the restaurant does get crowded however it is a large restaurant. Get the sangria for sure!! We did street parking although I believe they also had valet. Definitely go with a group of people since it's tapas style! Portions are larger than what I was expecting.
