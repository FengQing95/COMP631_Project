The Purple Pig////I get it now!  Great food, reasonably priced. Everything has some meat, sauce and shredded something.  I sat at the chefs table and got to see 8 people crammed together push out amazing food quickly. The chefs table were all tourists who came because of a guidebook, many mentioned the James Beard award, all tried different dishes.
