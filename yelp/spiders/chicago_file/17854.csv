Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Egh, perhaps this place was a little too hyped up that it led to my disappointment. I guess I was expecting the best deep dish in Chicago but sorry this place fell short. I tried their traditional deep dish pie. Sauce was pretty bland and my crust was soggy. I made it a mission to try as many deep dish locations on my visit to Chicago but this place was my least favorite food wise. Service on the other hand was phenomenal and still worth the experience. I just wouldn't say it's the BEST deep dish in Chicago bc for me it definitely was not.
