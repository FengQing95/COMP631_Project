Little Goat Diner////Our food came quickly which was great.  I kept on getting hungry looking at the food waiting to be taken to the hungry diners.  After some obligitory pictures of our food we dug in.  Seriously, the Sloppy Goat was so good I don't think I will be able to eat another "sloppy Joe" again.  My friend created her own chili mac if you will which looked amazing.  I am kind of surprised that it is not on the menu for the cold winter days in Chicago.  I would buy it all the time.
