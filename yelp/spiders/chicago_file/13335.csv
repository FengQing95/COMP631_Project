Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Yes, the long long wait was very worth it! The 3 of us ordered, two 9" small pizzas, a caesar salad with chicken and a penne pasta. Our waiter Eric was so quick, attentive and sweet! And, not to belittle Eric, but, the pizzas were way over amazingly delicious, the caesar dressing was to die for and the penne pasta was incrediblle! Everyone from Chicago had told us Californians and 1 friend from Japan that you don't know pizza until you have a Chicago Pizza. We say you don't know pizza until you have Lou Malnati's!
