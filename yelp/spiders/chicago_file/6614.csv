The Purple Pig////This place is absolutely amazing!! We did not have a reservation but was able to find plenty of seat at the bar. In my opinion I really like to sit at the bar because I feel like the service is a lot faster and they have the full menu available as well. Everyone was very nice and the food and drinks came out in a timely manner. The food and drinks were absolutely amazing!! and the ambience was great!! I really recommend checking this place if you get the chance!
