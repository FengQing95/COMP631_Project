Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Small pan classic Chicago ($12.70) - The pizza was okay... the crust had a bit of cornmeal which I don't really like. Â The crust was definitely more bread-y than pastry. We both agreed that we didn't really like it, but there are many who do like this crust. I would have preferred a thinner crust.
