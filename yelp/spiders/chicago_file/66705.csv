Little Goat Diner////TOTALLY disappointed! I can't believe that The Girl and The Goat is sooooo good and Little Goat is soooooooooooo bad! Asian pancakes HORRIBLE! The Brandade disgusting! The star I'm giving here is for dessert, the blueberry pie is good and what makes it even better is the goat cheese ice cream! But the ice cream is from Black Dog Gelato (amazing!!!) so Stephanie's pie only deserves one star!
