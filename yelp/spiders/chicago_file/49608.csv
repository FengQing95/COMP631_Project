Smoque BBQ////they had suggested that i place my order about 10 days in advance so they could be ready. i dropped the ball and ended up ordering 3 days in advance so i was worried. when i arrived to pick up the food i was pleased to see that they were waiting for me to arrive prior to packaging the food so it would still be fresh and warm.
