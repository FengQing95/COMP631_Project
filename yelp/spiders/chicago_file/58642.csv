Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////First and foremost, I don't care how good the food is but the customer service I initially received was horrible. I've worked in customer service for years and the first impression I received was absolute trash. From what I can tell customers were for the most part were dressed casual. My friend and I were dressed casual, a little on the nerd side. I have checked for reservations since noon and saw that there were reservations around 3pm and 6pm available. So around 2pm we walked a mile to see if we can score a walk in. The lady who greeted us told us the next reservation wasn't till 9:15pm. Then she tells us to check the bar to see if there is any spots. There were spots but they were single seaters by the bar. Now that really ticked me off. Normally, the employees would offer to look for spots but to have customers look for their own seating Especially for an establishment of nearly 5000 Yelp reviews and four stars. That really was the tipping point for this review.
