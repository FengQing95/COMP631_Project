Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I came here on a Thursday for dinner with some people from work and our boss who flew in from Miami (who really has pretty high standards for food). This is a great place to take guests from out of town, at least during the week. The sangria was awesome (try the peach). Beef Tenderloin with Blue Cheese and the Spicy Potatoes are a must! Everyone enjoyed the food and I'll be going back with friends.
