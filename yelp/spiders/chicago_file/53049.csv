Smoque BBQ////Oh, and you may also end up waiting for anywhere from 10 minutes to half an hour depending on when you arrive, and end up sitting quite closely to some strangers.  But that's just how things are done when it comes to Texas BBQ, from my experience, so I didn't think too much of it.  Sucks in the winter to wait outside, but you can always call ahead for pick up or to check if they haven't run out of brisket (or whatever is your fancy).
