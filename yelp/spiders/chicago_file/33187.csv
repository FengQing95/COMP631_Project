Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great atmosphere, great old school cocktails and even better food.  Not the easiest place in town to get in, but worth the wait and fight for reservations.  I've actually had luck walking in late and getting a table or snagging a spot at the bar (reservations seem to be easing a little as well, as I was able to book a table on a Friday night with little notice, something that was unheard of a few months prior).
