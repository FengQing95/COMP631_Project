Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If I reviewed this just on the pizza, I'd give three stars. Sorry, this Chicago-style pizza casserole just isn't my thing -- not a fan of giant chunks of watery tomatoes on top of my pizza. And I like mouth-blistering melty pizza, and this was almost room temperature. But, if you visit Chicago, I think a visit to Lou Malnati's is worth the wait and the money. It's a Chicago experience.
