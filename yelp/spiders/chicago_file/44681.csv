Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Wow. Amazing. We had a great time there, it was our second time dining. The food was great, fresh and exotic at the same time. The bacon wrapped dates were out of this world, along with the blue cheese beef and don't forget the fried green peppers!! The red sangria goes really well with the meal to bc its not too sweet at all! And the desserts are amazing, the carmel cake is to die for! The tapas portions are perfeccct too!!
