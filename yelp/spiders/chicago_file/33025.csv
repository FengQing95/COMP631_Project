Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Overall great experience. The atmosphere of the restaurant is amazing, the menu is good and very reasonably priced for Chicago, and the service was excellent. Had the fried chicken entree, which was comfort food in all its glory and perfection. Sides of asparagus and mac and cheese, both of which were very good. Portions are very generous here - even entrees could be easily shared. Would definitely go back!
