Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went here, and I got a number of their tapas and the red sangria. The sangria was really good as were their tapas. I would definitely go again. We got the patatas bravas, calamari, and the Brussel sprouts. The brussel sprouts and calamari were my favorite. For dessert we got the flan, which I would definitely get again. The environment was really nice. They had windows open for covid, so it was a little cold in there. We felt well spaced from the other tables. The service was good and timely.
