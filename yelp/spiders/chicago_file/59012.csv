Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Out of the tapas we ordered, there were definitely some hits and some misses. The patatas bravas, brussels sprout salad and tomato baked goat cheese were all delicious, and the shrimp and croquetas were good, but I wouldn't get the piri-piri fried chicken thighs or crystal bread again. I definitely want to come back to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba to try the paella!
