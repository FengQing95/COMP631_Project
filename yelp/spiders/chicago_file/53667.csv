Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been here 3 times now and every time it is delicious. I highly recommend the Burrata, the seared Spanish sausages, and the stuffed mushrooms! Definitely get a reservation via the Lettuce Eats app or Open Table, because on a weekend you can wait over an hour for a table. Also, this place keeps getting busier and louder every time we go, so I recommend going on a week night if you can. Enjoy!!
