Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Miserable. I left Bavette's miserable. I ate so much I felt like my stomach needed to explode for some chance of relief. I really ate too much, but I seriously could not help myself. And in the end, I paid for it. But, it was a great feeling because the food was just that good. Mind blowing.
