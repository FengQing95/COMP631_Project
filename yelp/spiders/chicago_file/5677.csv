The Purple Pig////What I'm trying to say is that the food was a hit or a miss for me. The ambiance was very classy yet casual. The wait for the restrooms was unfortunate as there was only one or two for customers and employees to use. The place offers indoor and outdoor seating which was beautiful for a sunny day like the one we visited. The service was top-notch as well.
