Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The shrimp were served with Flavored Texas Toast Â and sitting in a difficult to explain sauce which was good enough to drink with a straw. I thought the toast was a star in its own but when dipped in the sauce, I genuinely wished there was more bread. After all, there is only so much sauce you can get on a slice of toast and I did not want this sauce to go to waste.
