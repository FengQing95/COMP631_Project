Little Goat Diner////There are a LOT of people who work at Little Goat: the bakery next door bakes all the bread for the diner, for sale, and for Girl and the Goat, and there's a bartender and several baristas, and hostesses, and busboys, and chefs.  It's only been open for a little over 4 months, but they need to work on their communication.  We got our food after both parties next to us, who were seated after us (this is OK, the place is busy) but no one seemed to know who had ordered what.  Some dishes came out twice- i.e. the couple next to us had a sandwich delivered, then a few minutes later, a copy of that sandwich appeared which no one had ordered.  Meanwhile the other half of the couple was sitting and waiting for his meal for a long time.  Our soup went to them first, and we got someone's burger (which looked quite good).
