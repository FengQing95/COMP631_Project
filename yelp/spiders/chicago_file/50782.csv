Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We opened with the burrata tomato bread. Yumz! The bread is toasted, there's a little zip to the sauce and it was total yum. Three pieces. The cheese served with it was great with this, but I reserved it to have with the table bread or tasted on its own, because it was just that good.
