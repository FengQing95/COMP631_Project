Little Goat Diner////I am from out of town but this place is a MUST visit! The service and food are out of control. Amanda always had a smile on her face and was so passionate about the entire menu. Peter might as well have a doctorate in mixology because he will not let you have a drink unless you are completely satisfied. The food is outstanding and even when you think you can't eat any more, you just keep eating because you don't want it to end. Thank you Little Goat for such a great time!
