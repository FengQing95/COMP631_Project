Smoque BBQ////Best bbq joint in Chicago. Have been coming to this place since they opened. They've figured out some of the kinks over the years. Taking your order to go? Call it in. Even if it's on your way to pick it up. Should save you some wait time. Nothing we haven't liked from here. The peach cobbler definitely a yes for dessert! The ribs, you've got 2 choices. I never rem2mber which to get so get both every time. I end up likely the leaner ones,whichever those are.
