Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Honestly this place didn't live up to the hype. Mind you the pizza was still good but had a lot of expectations coming here! I will say that the cheese and sauce were a great taste. However the reason why I give it three stars is because I felt the pizza was a little watery, and I also felt like the crust had no taste to it. Usually I'm the type of person that I eats the crust first because I love it but it was a little underwhelming.
