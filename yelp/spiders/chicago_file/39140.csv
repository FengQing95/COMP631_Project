Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Always phenomenal food. During Covid they were the best nice restaurant to order takeout from. All food was prepped so well. For example, they intentionally undercooked the steak slightly so that while it was sitting in the box on the way to my house I wouldn't end up with overcoooked steak. Most places do not account for that. That's the kind of attention to detail I appreciate and the food and service is always excellent.
