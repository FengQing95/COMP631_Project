Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I went here with on valentines and it was one of the worst service that I've ever had. We got reservations over a month ahead and had to wait roughly an hour while everyone else got seated right away. This was because we looked young and they discriminated against us because of it. Its a shame because I was looking forward to celebrating Valentine's Day and a birthday but service the whole night was slow. The food was good but for that price and service, I will definitely be going elsewhere next time.
