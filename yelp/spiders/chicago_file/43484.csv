Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been trying to get a reservation here for a few weeks now that would make me leave work early at 430 or make me stay up too late till 11pm. Finally my boyfriend got us a reservation at 5 for valentines day. The atmosphere of the place is amazing. Not a huge fan of the long tables that you share with others but there are dividers or big flower fixtures so it was okay. We ordered a half pitcher of the red sangria and it was AMAZING! I sucked it down a little to fast and the rest of the night is a little fuzzy but I've sobered up enough to write this review! We ordered the pork paella which takes 30 minutes so onto Tapas! We got the cheese & spinach stuffed mushrooms first, I do not like mushrooms but I tried one and it was so good! They were cooked to perfection! Not to chewy which is what puts me off about mushrooms in the first place. Then we got the bacon wrapped dates which everyone raves about which I do now as well the perfect combo of sweet and bacon salty. Lastly we got spicy potatoes which were just regular potatoes with a cheese sauce...not something I would order I like to try new things at tapas but the boy friend wanted them. Then the paella came and WOW! So much food! It was delicious and enough to take home for tomorrow's lunch! This place is a little pricey but worth every penny. Try something new since everything is so amazing here you will be pleasantly surprised!
