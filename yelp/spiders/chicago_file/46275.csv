Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cold Tapas: I had the green beans, roasted tomatoes and shallots. And it was excellent, the beans were crisp and everything was well flavored. I also had the asparagus with grilled red onions and red pepper. The red onions and peppers were really good but the asparagus lacked flavor, although cooked to just the right crispness.
