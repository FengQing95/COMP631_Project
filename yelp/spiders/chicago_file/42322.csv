Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The night didn't start how it ends though. My date and I walked in to a smiling host who sat us right away. After meeting about 20 waiters (of course exaggerating but not by much) we were finally off ordering. To start we had stuffed mushrooms and the chicken empanadas which were both pleasant but nothing to tell mama about (Mama luuuuvess tapas). After a few drinks and some descent food, I was starting to think Caf√© Ba Ba Reeba and I were developing a nice relationship. Then I made the mistake of trying something new, but I thought it was safe I mean they are known for their paella, aren't they?!?! Hell, it's even in their logo "Tapas and Paella"! We ordered the "special" paella and what we received was "special" indeed... what was served was this greasy, soft rice, and what looked to be chicken (tasted like that "chicken" in frozen dinners other wise known as rib meat). It was a mess and both of us had the same feeling right away but being hungry still we decided to go with it. The portion size is for two but we could barely stomach it and decided to call it quits after eating only half of it (most of that half eaten by myself). Not feeling well right off the bat, we wanted quickly to call it a night but couldn't find our waiter, who hasn't shown up since stopping by when the paella came. It's almost unbelievable how quickly the night changed from good service and descent food to well the opposite. It was not a good night to say the least.
