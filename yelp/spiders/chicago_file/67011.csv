Little Goat Diner////Love this place. A fun, whimsical atmosphere accompanies delicious out of the food creating a lovely atmosphere. The blue plate special is a must try. Whatever the chef has cooking up is sure to please. Drinks are equally as amazing and the bar staff are funny and inviting. It offers great options for gluten free diners that do not disappoint. The only disappointment, like so many other places in the city, they do not take reservations for brunch. That's to be expected and it's worth getting up early on Sunday to come try what's new in the kitchen.
