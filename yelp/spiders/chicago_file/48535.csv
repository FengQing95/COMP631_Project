Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I used to go here back in the 90s and it was like no other place I had been before. Of course, it was my first experience with tapas. The fact that they let you sit there and enjoy your food (which was excellent) and drink for hours without rushing you out was completely novel to me. The last time I went there, everything was awful. The food was barely passable (overdone, lacking flavor). We had to be moved from our original table because the noise was absolutely deafening. The service was also barely passable. I have no desire to go back. Not when there are tapas places now that provide an enjoyable experience where you don't have to feel your head vibrate from the screeching drunk women surrounding you and you can get fresh, flavorful food.
