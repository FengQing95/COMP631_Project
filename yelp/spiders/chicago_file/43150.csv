Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////     We went here for somewhere fun for our 10th anniversary and also brought along my wife's parents for their 38th anniversary.  We had a 9:30pm rez and arrived right on time.  The restaurant was hopping and there was still a huge wait to get in.  As busy as it was we got in 15 minutes later and sat at our table (getting dirty looks from people who had obviously been waiting for an hour).  This really isn't a normal anniversary type place (loud, busy, action packed), but we are not a normal couple so it worked.  The atmosphere was hopping and cool.  I liked the whole setup they had going on and the place is huge.  Bathrooms are meh but we really should not be spending too much time in them.
