Little Goat Diner////In the final analysis, I can't see myself coming here all the time. While I appreciate that they work a bit harder at giving you a nice classic meal here, it's too pricey for a sloppy joe or burger.   Maybe I'll start buying kimchee to put on the burgers I make at home.  I just need to remember not to forget the beers in the freezer.  That's a nightmare.
