Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////- malnati salad: romaine lettuce, tomatoes, black olives, mushrooms, salami bits, gorgonzola cheese, sweet vinaigrette, romano cheese. honestly, this salad kind of blew my mind. it hit every flavor note and texture note you could think of. sweet, tangy, salty, crunchy, savory. it was really refreshing after walking around the city on the warm spring day.
