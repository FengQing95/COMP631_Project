Little Goat Diner////I really, truly wanted to love this place. I know it's probably our own fault for not making a reservation, but we ended up waiting over an hour to get a table, which is less than ideal after a night of drinking. When we finally were seated, we were left to sit at the table for another 20 minutes without water while the servers presumably were allowing us to decide what to order despite our extended wait. When we finally did have our order taken, they were out of three of the meals we wanted, so we had to resort to quick picks at the server's suggestions.
