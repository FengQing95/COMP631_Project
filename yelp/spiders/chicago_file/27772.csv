Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The server arrived and let us know that the GF pizza had been made incorrectly (presumably with cheese), so the deep dish was delivered while the GF pizza was re-made.  In total, that took an more than 15 minutes, so everyone else had basically finished eating while the GF person (me) watched.
