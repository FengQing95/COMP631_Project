Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Excellent cuisine. The menu is comprehensive and seasonal, with a high level of quality. Definitely a fantastic eating experience. It can be pricey, but it's well worth it, plus they have such a nice theme that is extremely romantic, has dim light that will surely set the mood and is perfect for a dinner date with your loved ones. I came here with my wife to celebrate our anniversary and she totally likes our date that night. The staff are all accommodating and warmly greet us when we enter. We made a reservation here two days ago and I'm thankful that we did that because we got a nice spot. There are a lot of options and it all looks delicious so we had a hard time ordering. It's definitely one of our best nights!  A very memorable one. I highly recommend this restaurant. It's surely expensive but it's worth the price. And next time, we will come here again with our friends.
