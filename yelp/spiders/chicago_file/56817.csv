Smoque BBQ////I went today and got the chopped brisket meal with an addition of a 1/4 rack of ribs. The brisket had a lot of smokey flavor that mixed very well with the flavor of the barbeque sauce. The ribs had the similar smokey flavor, but had a different twinge to them. I assume that twinge is the St. Louis style. For my sides, I got the corn bread, peach cobber, and the free addition of cole slaw. The corn bread was very moist and flavorful. As a corn bread lover, I was very satisfied. The cole slaw was oil based and very flavorful.
