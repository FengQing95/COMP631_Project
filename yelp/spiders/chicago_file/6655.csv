The Purple Pig////The starters were on point. The foie was clean and decadent at the same time. The balance of flavors and textures was a great way to start our journey. Next was the beautifully presented burrata. I know others ordered the tartare and presentation looked similar. But coming from the west coast, I figured we'd skip the fish. The cauliflower is a really unique dish. Who would've thought that lil gherkins paired so well with cauliflower? Almost cleaned the entire mountain of a portion. The ravioletto came next and was the least memorable of all the dishes. A lot of sauce and really just felt like cream on top of a blanket of well-made pasta.
