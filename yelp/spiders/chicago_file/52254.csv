Smoque BBQ////I grew up in Texas, so when a Texan buddy of mine was in town visiting me in Chicago he told me he had seen this Smoque BBQ place on DDD and we should definitely try it out. Texas BBQ? Profiled on Food Network? Sounded like a no-brainer and we were excited about trying it out. It was an unusually hot and muggy June day (very Texas like), so the scene was set for a little reminder of home. Or at least that was the thought process...
