Smoque BBQ////We got here on a weeknight a little after 6pm and were prepared to wait in line until we had experienced many emotions ranging from excitement, to indifference, to frustration, to near starvation, to murderous rage, satisfaction, forgiveness, and everything in between, but we only had to wait a whopping 5 minutes before placing our order. I love that the menu is written on a chalkboard so you can decide what you want while you wait in line. We both got the brisket platter with the BBQ beans, fries, Â and mac n' cheese. Both of our meals came with a side of cole slaw.
