Little Goat Diner////- beef sandwich - I really liked this, but Engy A. didn't.  The flavor is more intense than in the shrimp and is more exotically flavored.  Maybe it was the kimchi she didn't like, but I really enjoyed it.  I possibly would've liked it better with dill pickle rather than bread & butter.
