Little Goat Diner////Service was okay, but they are always busy, so you can't really expect white tablecloth service.  Wait wasn't too terrible for arriving for lunch at 11:00 - it was about 45 minutes.  It's nice that they text you when you're table is available so you can walk around on Randolph... when it's not during a heat wave!!
