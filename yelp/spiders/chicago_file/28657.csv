Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////During our visit to Chicago, my husband and I stopped in for the famous deep dish pizza. I was told a tip about calling in your pizza order ahead of time because it does take a while to make, but when I called they did not seem like they had ever had someone do that and would not let me. Upon arrival, since I already knew which pizza I wanted, I ordered it right away along with the sampler appetizer and garlic cheese bread. The garlic cheese bread was delicious! Somehow it was very soft while still being toasty. The sampler was good, but left something to be desired. The fried zucchini was just about tasteless; I've had much better in the past. The fried mushrooms, the fried mozarella, and fried cheese bites were just ok, nothing that stood out. Our deep dish pizza arrived and our server cut it and placed it on plates for us, which was very helpful. The pizza was good, but I wanted it to be so much better. I liked how the sausage was ground up and not in chunks and it had a good flavor. The marinara sauce needed more seasoning in my opinion. Next time I visit Chicago, I don't think I will return to Lou Malnati's.
