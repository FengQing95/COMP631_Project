Smoque BBQ////Smoque was ok, but i won't be going out of my way to get here again.  I hate to say it, but suspect the meats were not fully cooked over wood.  This is a deal breaker for any BBQ place in my book.  The ribs we had were not very meaty and the sauce could have been better (honestly it was not memorable).  Otherwise the ordering at the counter and sit down is a fine system, but the layout of this place is bad which makes for an uncomfortable dining room.  I hear the line is typical - so why not change the layout?
