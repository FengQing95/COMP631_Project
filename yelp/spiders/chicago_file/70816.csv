Little Goat Diner////Food was great but the service was terrible. I came in at 8pm the other night and got seated at a corner booth but was ignored for 20 minutes so I left. I decided to give it another try so I went in for lunch today. I was seated at the kitchen counter and was barely "tolerated" by the waiter. A white business man came in after and sat next to me and was always served first. When the waiter saw the manager talking with him, she made sure he got extra service and again barely "tolerated" me. Both of these incidents made me feel there is a certain sense of classism pervading this establishment. I am a women of color and grew up in be Midwest so being treated differently is not new to me, but I expected to be treated equally as a paying customer at this reputable restaurant and it sadly wasn't the case. I won't be returning.
