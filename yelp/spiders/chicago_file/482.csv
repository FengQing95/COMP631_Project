Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////what is with all the hype? wildberry pancakes are nothing special and their skillets are worse than what i can make at home! everything is bland and served cold (also didn't help that we were seated outside on a chilly day but the food seriously came out lukewarm)... :( i'm sure there are many better brunch options in chicago (with maybe even less of a wait) so save your stomach for something better!
