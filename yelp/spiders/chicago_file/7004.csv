Art Institute of Chicago////Awesome and laid out in an easy to follow manner. Definitely check-out the Chagall, Van Gogh's Haystacks, and the huge Sirat. Make sure you check out the Russian Tea Room across the street, see review, or eat in the statue garden in the center of the museum if it is a nice day. Â  Check for FREE days, as with all the Chicago museums.
