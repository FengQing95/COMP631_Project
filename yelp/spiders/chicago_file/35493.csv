Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My boyfriend and I went here for dinner after a recent trip to see Phantom of the Opera. We had heard good things but getting a reservation was tricky. We ended up with a 5pm slot on a Sunday night. It was right when the place was opening, but you would never have guessed it (except for the fact that it wasn't too busy yet).
