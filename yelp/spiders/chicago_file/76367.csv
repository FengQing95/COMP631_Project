Little Goat Diner////Portions here are GENEROUS! Our waitress suggested my husband and I might share one dish and then supplement with a side or "snack," she was spot on. The dish we ended up choosing was the Shrimp and Pork Belly which she warned us was on the lighter side so that we could go with the heavier appetizer/snack of the Goat Chili Cheese Fries.
