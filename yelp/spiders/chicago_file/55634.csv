Smoque BBQ////We finally made it to Smoque, and it was everything we had heard it would be and more. We picked up and brought home, and everything stayed warm and delicious after the 20 minute drive. We got chicken, which was so moist and smoky, and the ribs, which were really tender, and the pulled pork, which was also moist and full of flavor. For sides we got the cornbread and the mac and cheese, which come in little metal containers that they're baked in, so everything stays really moist. The bread was full of flavor and had pieces of corn in it, and the mac and cheese had a great topping.
