Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I could spend all day writing this review, but I'll try to keep it somewhat short.  My fiance (and now wife) decided on Cafe BBR for our short wedding ceremony and the reception.  At first I was very skeptical, but I have never seen a place with such a genuinely friendly, helpful, and fun-loving staff.  From the planner, Michelle, to the waiters and waitresses, the valet staff on site throughout the night, and the bartenders, I was amazed.  Out of the 125 people in attendance, 125 people loved the various tapas that my wife and I chose for the event.  Even one of our photographers, who came from downstate Illinois, is planning on having her birthday party at Cafe BBR as a result of how amazed she was by how organized and helpful the staff was and by how amazing the food tasted.  Everything about this place is spectacular, and I would 100% encourage anyone planning an event to consider Cafe BBR.  Even my picky wife agreed!
