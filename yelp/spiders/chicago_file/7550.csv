Art Institute of Chicago////This is a excellent museum! Whether you are a tourist or a local, it's a great place to spend a few hours. It's huge so don't bank on seeing it all in one visit. It has huge collections of neoclassical, renaissance, surrealist, modern, ancient... basically everything and also random temporary Â exhibits on different cultures (bordering on more historical than artistic displays) and unconventional types of art (one was on miniatures of home interiors... almost mini doll houses... not my favorite but interesting).
