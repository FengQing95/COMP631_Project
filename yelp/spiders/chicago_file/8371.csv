Art Institute of Chicago////As a native Chicagoan recommending things to see in Chicago, the Art Institute of Chicago is on the top of the list. If you had only a day to spend in the city, and could only see one thing, I would probably recommend that you spend that day in the Art Institute, unless you have a particular mindset that isn't fond of art.
