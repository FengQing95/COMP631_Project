Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Excellent place for brunch!  We actually choose this place based on yelp reviews and people were not lying.  We went on a Sunday morning and the wait was about an hour to get in.  I ordered an omelette and for a $1 more, you are allowed to substitute the sides for one of their speciality pancakes.  We ordered the cinnamon roll pancakes and it was cinnamon, sweet goodness.  Honestly, these pancakes were amazing!
