Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////YUM!!  Came here for the first time on a Friday morning, about 10ish. We ordered breakfast and were very impressed.  Our server was great and personable.  Everyone loved their food!  I have a wheat allergy and ordered the gluten free pancakes to go with my eggs.  These were hands down the BEST pancakes I have had.  I highly recommend them if you have a wheat or gluten allergy.  We will be making Wildberry's a Friday morning tradition.
