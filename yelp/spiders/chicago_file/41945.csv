Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Now the wine.  I expect that a Spanish restaurant should have all good wine on their list, but I tried a couple different kinds on my first visit that I wasn't too thrilled with, so this time I stuck to the sangria, which was kind of weak-flavored.  At least it was refreshing and not overly sweet, and it did manage to give me a little kick.
