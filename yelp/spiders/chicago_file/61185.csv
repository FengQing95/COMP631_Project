Smoque BBQ////After watching Frank Underwood down some of Freddy's ribs (House of Cards fans will understand) I decided I wanted to try myself some of chicago's best ribs. DID NOT DISAPPOINT. NOT SUPER CHEAP, BUT EXTREMELY WORTH. Anyways, I got myself the St. Louis Full Slab of ribs with sides of slaw, bbq baked beans, and mac n cheese and shared it with my girlfriend. We were both extremely pleased and found the ribs to be delicious. The ribs were easy to rip apart which made it easy to eat! I had gotten an order to go so we didn't sit in but the line extended all the way outside even on a Sunday evening!  I would highly recommend the slaw and beans but not so much the mac and cheese.  I wish there was more sauce but other than that, this place was near to perfect. I'm sure next time I see vice president underwood eat some ribs, I'll be back here to fulfill my rib craving.
