Little Goat Diner////I ordered the Bull's Eye French Toast and too my surprise it was covered in strawberries. Yuck! I don't care much for strawberries so as soon as this dish was set down in front of me I was totally bummed. I scooted these off and around and only had a few bites of them, but the French toast was just way to soggy for me. The only semi tolerable part of this dish was the chicken.
