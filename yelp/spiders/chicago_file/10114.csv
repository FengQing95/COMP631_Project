Art Institute of Chicago////I have been going to the Art Institute for as long as I can remember.  The best part is that our relationship has grown and that I appreciate new things at every stage of life.  When I was younger I was obsessed with the Thorne Rooms and thought that the Chagall windows were pretty neat.
