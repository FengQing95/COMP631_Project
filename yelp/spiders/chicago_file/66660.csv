Little Goat Diner////I've liked everything I've tried so far! The portions are fairly large - I shared a breakfast entree and a potato side with my friend and it was more than enough. Can't wait to go back for the "fish tacos" again! I also love the adjacent bar/bakery. Got the shrimp sandwich to go and it was very tasty.
