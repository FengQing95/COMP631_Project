Little Goat Diner////This was the classiest diner ever!! Marble table tops and extra spacious booth seats were COOL. I can't classify it as a diner either and yes that is where The Little Goat excels: It provides its own value. I wasn't exactly in the mood for a large meal. I explained myself to my server Jennifer very kindly went over the menu with me for great options. We both agreed that the Pork Belly Pancake was worth the try and together with that a light pony pilsner. I felt really good when I found so many Korean-fusion dishes (pride for my own heritage perhaps?)
