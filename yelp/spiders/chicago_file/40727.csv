Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////First tapas experience and I had alot of fun. Friend got me a giftcard that worked here so I went on a date with my girlfriend here. Great service and it's huge. I loved almost everything we got and when people say try the bacon wrapped dates and spicy potatos believe them. Only bad thing was that I didn't really care for the braised lamb as it was overly salty. I definitely want to go again.
