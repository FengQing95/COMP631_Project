Little Goat Diner////I love this diner! The food was so tasty, the atmosphere was hip and chic, and if you want to skip the wait, you can choose bar seating. It was quite crowded the weekend I decided to go, and even though I made a reservation, I was still given bar seating. I ordered the chicken and waffles dish and it is easily one of the best restaurants to serve the pairing. You wont regret it!
