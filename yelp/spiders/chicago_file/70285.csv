Little Goat Diner////My boyfriend and I went here for breakfast and everything was delicious! He got the bulls eye French toast and I got the burrito. My only problem is that I also ordered a mimosa ($10) and literally only got a shot glass of mimosa. It wasn't really any better than the bottomless mimosas you can get at other brunch spots so I'm not sure why it's so expensive... My boyfriend got a Bloody Mary which he said was delicious and much more reasonably sized for $14. I'd definitely come back I just won't get a mimosa next time.
