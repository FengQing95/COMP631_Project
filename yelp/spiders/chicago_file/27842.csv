Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Extremely disappointing deep dish pizza at Lou's. Being from Florida, I was looking forward to deep dish but it didn't lead up to expectations we had heard about Lou's. Our pizza was cold and mainly all cheese and barely any sauce. It was almost as if it was previously frozen and re- heated. Couldn't even finish one slice. Ordered a small cheese deep dish and it was as if the cheese congealed more and more as we attempted to eat it. Waiter rushed us out and 5 minutes after we got our pizza, he asked if we needed a box. Might have just been an off day but would not recommend Lou's to anyone, frozen pizza is better than what we were served.
