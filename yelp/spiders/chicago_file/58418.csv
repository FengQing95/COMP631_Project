Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn't think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion
