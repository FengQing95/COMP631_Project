Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'll be honest, I wasn't really a big fan of their deep dish here. We got 2 larges for 8 people and it was more than enough. They say one large feeds 4. The butter crust had good crunch, but was a bit bland. And the pizza was just oddly layered. The meat and cheese were each their own layer and it was like biting into a cracker with cheese and meat stacked on top of it rather than a pizza as a whole with its ingredients combined. I don't know, it's hard to explain but the pizza just didn't feel right when I ate it. Maybe I came on a bad day but I definitely preferred Giordano's deep dish. I'd be willing to come back and try it on another day or maybe get their thin crust, but I definitely was not impressed on my first visit.
