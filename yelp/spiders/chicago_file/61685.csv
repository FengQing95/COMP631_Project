Smoque BBQ////Why 3 stars?  I have been to Lockhart, Taylor, and Elgin, Texas.  The food at Smoque is as good, perhaps.  But, unlike Blacks or Smittys or Meyers or Muellers, Smoque doesn't have soul.  Well managed, easy in and out, good food, but no soul.  Maybe, one day it will be laid back and the walls and tables will smell like smoke.  Time will tell.
