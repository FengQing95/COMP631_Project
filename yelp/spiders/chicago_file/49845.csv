Smoque BBQ////AWESOME.  The best BBQ I've ever had, hands down.  I'll admit I was frustrated after leaving here empty handed (and stomached) the first two times I tried to eat here, as the line was either too long or they ran out of beef brisket.  To be fair, Smoque had just been featured on the Food Network so there was a lot of built up hype.  I gave it one more shot, and wow was it worth it!  I usually go with the chopped brisket (smoky, moist, and tender, with those great little bits of blackened beef evenly dispersed throughout).  The BBQ sauce (Memphis style I believe) has great flavor and a nice acidic kick from the higher vinegar content.  Wanna get your hands dirty?  Go with the St. Louis ribs.  They're, moist, tender and meaty.  Solid mac & cheese and fresh cut fries.  Top that all off with BYOB and you can't go wrong.
