Art Institute of Chicago////Fantastic museum!  I've been here probably over a dozen times.  I most likely can't add anything new to what's already been said, but it's really one of my favorite museums period.  It is much more convenient than some of the other museums in Chicago (Field, Science & Industry, Shedd) if you're already downtown.
