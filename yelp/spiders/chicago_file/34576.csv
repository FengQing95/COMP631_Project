Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The décor of Bavette's is very classy; low lighting, wood paneling, a beautiful bar area, and incredibly comfortable leather booths.  To be fair, the low lighting can make it a little difficult to navigate the seating area when you first walk in and we all cut corners a little too tight around some of the tables.  That said, definitely like the feel of the place.
