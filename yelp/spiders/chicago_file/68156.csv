Little Goat Diner////Stopped in for late night dessert after a meal at Sushi Dokku, and had a great time and great desserts!  The PB&J sundae and the pecan pie sunday were both wonderful!  Plenty of coffee, tea and alcoholic after dinner drinks were also available and it was really fun to watch the giant burgers and other diner-style-goat-influenced dishes go by and see the tables freak out by the size/presentation of the meals.  Looking forward to going back for the all day breakfast (I am a huge fan of brinner) and other assorted goodies the had on the menu!
