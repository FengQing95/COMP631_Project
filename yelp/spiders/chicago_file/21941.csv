Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They make it real easy for newbies by offering the Malnati Chicago Classic where they through some of their famous lean sausage, cheese and tomato sauce onto a beautiful Buttercrust that captivates hearts and minds. Count me in. We also added some spinach in there. It was gorgeous. The crust was probably my favorite part of the pizza, along with everything else. Loved using a knife and fork to eat the pizza, and made sure that I included a piece of the crust with each bite. The sausage was ridiculously good. It's not pieces of sausage, but rather a sausage patty that covers the entire pizza. So freakin delicious.
