Smoque BBQ////My family and I have been coming to Smoque for years now and I feel like it's always going to be one of our main spots. The barbecue is incomparable to anywhere else around and cooked to perfection every-time I've ordered. I always order the 1/2 chicken with French fries and their Mac and cheese and could never get tired of it. I even brought some back for a few friends one day and they still ask me about it. M b
