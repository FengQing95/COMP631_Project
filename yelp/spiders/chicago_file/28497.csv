Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It was hard narrowing down a single pizzeria to visit during our trip, but a lot of Yelp lists and locals seem to like Lou Malnati's. We came on a Thursday night, and there was no wait for a party of two. I loved the atmosphere -- very Chicagoan and classic. Our server was friendly and made some great recommendations. And just a warning - deep dish pizzas take about 30 minutes to make, at least here, so this is definitely not the place for a quick bite.
