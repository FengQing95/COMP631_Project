Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The atmosphere/service: I love the design and decor.  I'm looking forwarded to trying it during the summer time with the roof open.  The service was alright.  The hostess seemed annoyed that two people would dare walk into the restaurant on a decently busy Sunday evening.  She just had us move to the side, without any instruction, so we waited awkwardly.  Our friendly waiter made up for the initial attitude we received.
