Little Goat Diner////I arrived early and was invited to wait for my daughter-in-law either at the table or the bar area, I choose to have a drink at the bar. Â Bartenders made a good dry Tito martini and they could use a little bartender manners - friendliness, chatter, etc. - especially when the drinks are overpriced.
