Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My girlfriend and I sat on the patio and the service was good out there, though we failed to read anything that would have warned us the food takes 35-40 minutes or else we would have planned our day better and not gotten so annoyed by the wait.  Once the food came, I will admit I devoured it.  Again, it's not that it wasn't good, it's just that you walk in expecting to be floored and really struggle with the idea of NY v. Chicago pizza.  There is no struggle, there is no contest.
