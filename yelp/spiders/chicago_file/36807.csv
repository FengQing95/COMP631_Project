Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Went to Bavette's w/ some old friends for a fabulous meal.  Had a reservation at the Chicago Chop House but got nervous after reading some bad reviews and decided to cancel and try to get into Bavette's.  No reservation but we called and they said they do accept walk-ins.  So we walked in at 5:30 and sat in bar until they could seat us-about an hour +.  We ended up being seated downstairs in a big cozy booth. The atmosphere down there was really cool w/ dim lights, jazz, & speakeasy style.
