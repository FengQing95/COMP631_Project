Little Goat Diner////I truly can't comment on the restaurant, just my experience trying to dine there. A friend of mine who lives in Chicago suggested we try it for lunch, the menu looked great so I said yes. I was coming in from Midway (I have a car there) and I asked her if I should take the el to the restaurant, she thought driving would be easier. GPS told me it would take  22 minutes to get there.  Great!  Not a bad drive at all. However once I got there I spent an additional 20 minutes driving around looking for parking. I was reluctant to pay $17 for valet but finally agreed to it when my friend said they were about to give away our table. I pulled near the valet stand then proceeded to wait an additional 5 minutes in 20 degree weather (Thursday afternoon in January) because there was no one attending the valet booth. I waited outside my car as there was a line forming for the valet. Another customer waiting to park, and another waiting to pick up his car. When the attendant finally arrived he very rudely told me he couldn't valet my car as I didn't have it parked in the right spot. No way was I trusting this hot tempered guy with my car. There is no signage telling you where to wait BTW. I was so flustered at this point I called my friend and told her we'd have to skip it. I was frustrated and starving as I didn't eat that morning in anticipation of a great lunch. Instead I made the two hour drive home and had a frozen pizza. I would not recommend this place if you are planning on driving.
