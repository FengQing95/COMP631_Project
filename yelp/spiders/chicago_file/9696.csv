Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute is a staple of Chicago, and an incredible museum! They have student discounts, which cuts the price in half, and coat checks for $1. You could easily spend hours wandering the halls of the museum, but they make it very easy to find major works. The layout as a whole is fairly intuitive to navigate, and there is so much to drink in.
