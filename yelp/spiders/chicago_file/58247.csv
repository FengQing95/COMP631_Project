Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Awesome place - cool environment, great food, delicious Sangria!! We had the croquettes & the bread for an appetizer... you must try the croquettes!! For our main meal we split the seafood paella... also delicious and the right amount of food for 2-3 people. Oh and the dessert flight was to die for, especially the butterscotch custard. Lastly, make sure you get a pitcher of Sangria (also delicious and 5-6 glasses total).
