Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I should start by saying I know absolutely nothing about Chicago pizza. I chose this restaurant based upon online recommendations and the fact that it had fairly easy access to the I-94. I don't know whether the pizza was in fact authentic, but it was unique and very good. The service was top-notch, especially considering how busy the place was at lunchtime on Tuesday. The decor and overall ambiance of the place was exactly what I was hoping for from a Chicago pizzeria. My only complaint was that there was no parking nearby, so I had to leave my car in the carpark down the street -- it cost me 44 freakin' dollars for an hour!
