The Purple Pig////I had never been to the Purple Pig but it was such a great little spot. Right off of the Magnificent Mile, anchored to the water in proximity to all things Chicago, the food was displayed and prepared well. There was a nice variety of flavor combinations. All the food came out tapas style and I found myself wanting to eat off of other peoples plates. You are seated family style so be prepared to sit next to and across from folks you don't know. If you are open you might meet someone who is interesting. In our case everyone who was near us was pretty awesome. They used this white dill sauce with lots of dishes that threw me off a bit initially given my disdain for white sauces but I was able to move past it right to my perfectly blended Old Fashioned. It was divine! The weather was perfect for it. My wife wanted to do a wine flight but they have flights so she ordered four wines and created her own using Greek wines. Not the most frugal way to go about a wine tasting at a place like the Purple Pig but all of the wines were delicious nonetheless. I'd recommend this place for sure. Did you see the pictures? Everything was delicious!
