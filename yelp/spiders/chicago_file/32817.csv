Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I'm a steak and potatoes kinda gal so when I read that this place has one of the best steaks you can get in Chicago I HAD to try it. I came into town to catch Da Bears (who unfortunately had a terrible game) and had a hankering for some good steak to remedy that sad loss. We tried making reservations on the phone but were told they were booked for the night but that the bar area has a full menu and open seating.  So we made a quick trek over on the "L" and was pleasantly surprised that a table was available. We ordered a salad, the 22 oz. dry-aged bone-in ribeye and a side of potatoes. I couldn't be more HAPPY with everything we ordered. The 22 oz. steak is big enough to be shared and is perfection! Perfectly cooked (medium rare). Melts in your mouth and full of flavor. They even give you some extra house blended salt that they use to cook the steak so you can sprinkle more on the steak. The steak didn't really need the extra seasoning since it was perfect as is.  And the service was impeccable! My glass of water was never half empty. I wish this place was in LA...but then again, I'd be here every night and about 500 lbs! The restaurant is also gorgeous! Dimly lit and not too terribly loud nor quiet. Overall, this place is Da-vine!
