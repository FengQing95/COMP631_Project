The Purple Pig////We get there...and we're told it's 35-45 minute wait for two people.  I look at her (and I'm pretty sure she's the one we spoke to on the phone) and ask her "how in 7 minutes, it went from no wait to almost 45 min?"  I was guessing a 10 min wait tops.  She said "we had a line out the door."  Why didn't she tell us that on the phone???  What did she hope to gain by lying to us on the phone?
