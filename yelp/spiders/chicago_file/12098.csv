Art Institute of Chicago////The line is long...we got the Chicago Explorer Pass, so it counts as fast pass, go to the receptionist and he'll exchange it into tickets for you. Skip the whole line and save some time for some art! The ticketing lady did not tell us this and she was super rude. The guy who helped us was super nice though.
