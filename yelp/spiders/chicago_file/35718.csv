Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I ordered the Prime Rib with Mashed Potatoes, nothing out of the ordinary... the waiter Â (who rushed us to order and was a little abrasive) came back to let us know they were out of potatoes. Very strange considering I'm sure this has to be one of the top two sides. I ended up ordering the Steak and Frites. My wife ordered the Beef Stroganoff and she was really excited. The stroganoff tasted Asian!! So strange, although not bad it really tasted of soy sauce which in my book was not good. The Steak and Frites were good, but I thought the fries seemed a little dry and the steak was good but nothing to write home about.
