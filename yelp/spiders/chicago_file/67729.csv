Little Goat Diner////The menu *reads* great.  I was very excited to brunch here, went there aware of the seating conditions, popularity, and likely-lengthy wait on an early-Sunday afternoon, and entered the establishment fully-prepared to be at least satisfied, if not outright impressed.  But honestly, based on this experience, the Little Goat probably deserves half of the two stars I'm awarding it.  However, I'm sympathetically retaining the second because: (a) the goat-burger, while not superb, was far from the train-wreck and bus-crash that the other two dishes, respectively, were; (b) one experience is still just one experience; (c) they serve Horseshoes.
