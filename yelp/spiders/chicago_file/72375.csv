Little Goat Diner////We visited this spot for breakfast while visiting from out of town, and were a little underwhelmed.  The food was decent, just not anything memorable-- and for those prices, I expect to be blown away.  Still, I like the focus on local ingredients, and I appreciate the hipster vibe.
