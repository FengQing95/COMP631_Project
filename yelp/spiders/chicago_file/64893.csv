Smoque BBQ////I like Smoque. It's definitely one of the best BBQ spots in the city. The staff is pretty nice, and venue quaint and appropriate. It has a likely atmosphere, and a nice patio. I've tried the food on several occasions... both dine-in and catering. Dine-in is almost always better. The catering option has been dry or surprisingly small on a few occasions.
