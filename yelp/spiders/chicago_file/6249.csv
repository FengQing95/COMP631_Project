The Purple Pig////Came here for the first time because it's one of the most popular restaurants in Chicago, but it's really disappointed me! We ordered three dishes and each of them is way too salty. It's overpriced and not worth the rave reviews. We drink a lot of water after dinner and throat feels so uncomfortable. Not recommend it, I would rather eat Chick Fill A close by.
