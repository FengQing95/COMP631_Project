Little Goat Diner////Little Goat exceeded the considerable hype Stephanie Izard's restaurants have been getting. The diverse menu, exceedingly friendly service, cool concept, and non-prohibitive pricing should appeal to most diners. Little Goat has reinforced Chicago's dining prowess and earned a revisit next time I'm in town.
