Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Bacon wrapped dates are the number one reason why I come to BaBaReeba but they have many other yummy qualities too (such as goat cheese croqueta, the scallops, beef empanada and I love the desserts there!!).  This is a perfect place for groups to share many dishes and drink their delicious sangria (the red is my fav!).  This is also a great brunch place especially when it is warm out and you can sit outside.  Do not walk in on a weekend without reservations.  This place is very popular!   I don't like how close you have to sit to other tables sometimes.  I feel like I can here and share in other people's conversations sometimes.  I have checked in here via Facebook twice and have gotten some type of free appetizer.  Who doesn't like free?  They were yummy too!
