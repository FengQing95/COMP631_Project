Little Goat Diner////My last "stuff my face" stop on my amazing trip to Chicago! During my vacation planning, most brunch places didn't allow reservations and if they do, trying to reserve two weeks in advance was pretty difficult. It isn't any easier at their sister company The Girl and the Goat across the way (good for dinner!)
