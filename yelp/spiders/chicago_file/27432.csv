Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We culminated our exploration of the Magnificent Mile with a trip to Lou Malnati's Pizzeria...unfortunately we got caught in crazy unexpected Chicago rainstorm so instead of arriving for an early dinner, we arrived right at the peak of dinner time. That. Kinda. Stunk. We were hit with a wait over an hour, but luckily Lou Malnati's is fairly aware of its ability to accommodate guests - definitely put your order in beforehand. They time it to come out shortly after you sit - genius!
