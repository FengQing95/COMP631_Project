Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////From the moment you step into Bavette's you feel as if you've gone back in time to a classy, cozy, 1950's Chicago restaurant. It's the kind of place that is mostly for special occasions, with the random regular man at the bar that eats dinner there daily. We went to Bavette's for our anniversary, coming an hour early to enjoy a nice cocktail at the bar before our reservation.
