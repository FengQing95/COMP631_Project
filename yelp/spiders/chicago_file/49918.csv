Smoque BBQ////Sweet Carolina! This is the best Carolina style BBQ I've ever eaten, better than anything I've actually had in the Carolinas or east Tennessee. In fact, when comparing some east Tennessee BBQ to this stuff I was embarrassed to tell folks there where it was done better. I think I was more surprised than anything else that this wasn't St. Louis or Kansas City BBQ.
