Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It was Wednesday night and we got our name and number down. We walked around the city for about an hour and a half before our table was ready. The pizza was good and pretty cheap, only $20 to share between 3 people. It was filling enough for us. I would have liked the cheese to be more melted, but everything was solid and sturdy. Another place that I'll be swinging by if I ever come back to Chicago. Lots of other pizza places that I'll need to try as well. 1 pizza in the 4 days I was there wasn't enough.
