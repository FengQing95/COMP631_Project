Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time trying a deep dish pizza at Lou Malnati's : great spot ! We decided to be kinda healthy by sharing the Malnati's salad - with Romaine lettuce, tomatoes, black olives, mushrooms, salami bits and gorgonzola cheese with our Sweet Vinaigrette and romano cheese. It was delicious, fresh. Nice blend of ingredient. Then we ordered a small deep dish pizza (way sufficient for 2 people), with half of the Malnati Chicago Classic ( with Lou's lean sausage, extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrus) and half of the Lou pizza. The pizza was very tasty, very cheezy, yum ! The Chicago classic was my favorite. The space is pretty typical of deep dish pizza places in town, with some jerseys on the wall. Service was great as well. Overall I prefered Lou Malnati's compared to Giordano's.
