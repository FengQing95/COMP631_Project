Smoque BBQ////The brisket at Smoque is really something to write home about. So rich and smokey and unbelievably tasty. The chicken is good too, really recommended if you like smoked chicken. I had to give the ribs a few tries before I warmed up to them, but I think they're great. The meat definitely doesn't fall off the bone, you're going to be using your jaw a little (which isn't necessarily a bad thing, just depends on your preference) but the ribs are charred in that special way that brings out every ounce of flavor in the meat.
