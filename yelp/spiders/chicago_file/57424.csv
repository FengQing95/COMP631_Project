Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ordered Brussel sprouts (its kinda hard to make such a generic dish extraordinary, but I liked the manchego cheese in it); Spicy potatoes is great, mild spicy and very flavorful big chuck of potato cubes. Beef tenderloin is great too, and loved the blue cheese init and the chips.
