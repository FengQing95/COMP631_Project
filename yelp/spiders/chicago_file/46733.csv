Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love this place!!! It's very very popular, so if you want a table, you need a reservation (otherwise bar seating works out eventually!). The grilled squid and the bacon-wrapped dates are my absolute favorites. The portions are pretty good for the price. I love bringing friends and dates here, this place is good either way. Highly recommend.
