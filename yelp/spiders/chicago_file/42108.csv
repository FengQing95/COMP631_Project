Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  Met some out of town friends here for dinner on a Sunday night - make reservations, even on a Sunday this place filled up by about 7.  I will definitely be back to add more favorites to this review but I really enjoyed the scallops, spicy potatoes and the asparagus.  I didn't get a chance to try the sangria, but I know there are like 5 or 6 varieties.  Our dinner was really cheap ($11 before tip) but that was mainly because we ordered vegetarian friendly dishes.   Can't wait to get back here!!
