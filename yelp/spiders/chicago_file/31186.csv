Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I mean.....you can't really go wrong here.  Maybe not the best ever or even in town, but so good there's really nothing not to like.  I would recommend if you do a salad to get the Lemon Garlic creamy dressing.  We had a Lou and a cheese with Olives.  Very different but both good.  Note it will take 35 minutes to cook your deep dish pizza and they are bigger than the estimate of how many they feed on the menu.
