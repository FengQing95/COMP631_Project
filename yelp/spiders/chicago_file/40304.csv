Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Overall, my experience was top notch. Except to spend to get the best experience: I felt my meal was well rounded and satisfying and did not mind paying what I did. Even the service fee felt fair, COVID hasn't been easy on anyone and if you're dining here you have more than enough money to pay the service fee
