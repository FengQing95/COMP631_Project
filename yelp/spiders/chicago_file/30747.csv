Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Quality of food: Great. We got the deep dish with cheese. I suggest ordering a size small for a group of 2 as you'll each get to have 2 slices. For a thin crust, 2 slices is not enough, however, for a deep dish this is more than enough. If one has never had a deep dish pizza before, it has basically a thick buttery crust with a lot of cheese and tomatoes piled on top. So...2 slices for lunch will have you pretty full. Lou's pizza is best compared to the competition as the sauce is not too tangy or sweet but seasoned just right. Also, the crust is not overly buttered up. The knife cuts through the crust with a nice pop proving that the crust is baked just right.
