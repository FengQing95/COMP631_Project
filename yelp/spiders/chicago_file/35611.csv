Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Probably one of the best meals of my life. Order modestly, it's pricey but the portions are huge and make it worth the slurpge. Definitely a night of my eyes being bigger then my stomach. Tried the duck & goat app and for dinner the lamp chops and filet mignon. Sidewise, the mashed potatoes are to die for as well as the butternut squash. Can't go wrong here. What a gem!
