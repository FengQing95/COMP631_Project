Smoque BBQ////I've been to the competition in the city and the suburbs, and the food I had at Smoque took longer, and was mediocre at best.  Don't get me wrong, it was good BBQ BECAUSE it is BBQ, but you probably want to look at my reviews to see where the better places are.  It was crowded, messy, and overall disappointing.
