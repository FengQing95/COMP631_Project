Smoque BBQ////the pork is moist, delicious and they give you a side of bbq sauce so you can drown the pork in sauce as you please ( which if you are me is a lot). Sides are also delish, the last time i got the beans, perfect for eating on your sandwich, Â and the mac and cheese. The beans were smokey with little nibbles of brisket mixed in. Mac and cheese was very good, but also very rich, i had to abandon ship mid way through.
