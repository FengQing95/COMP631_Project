Smoque BBQ////Holy COW. It's got to be since the brisket sandwiches are heavenly. Full of flavor and juicy enough that you don't need a drink to wash it down with. Juicy enough that you don't need any extra sauce. The sauce is vinegar based. I personally think it would be a little bit better if it had less vinegar but I think I will live. With a big smile on my face. The Mac & Cheese is awesome. Mind blowing. It's also tasty. I don't live too far from this joint and I have had it only a couple times. But I will be a regular at this establishment for a long time coming.
