Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tapas Tapas Tapas, this is what you should be having along with a few drinks. A very busy little place, but they sure do move in there, never waiting too long. A great atmosphere with great food, what more could you ask for? Coming from Arizona, it was great to see a place with such authenticity so far deep into the states away from the southern border. WELL DONE!!
