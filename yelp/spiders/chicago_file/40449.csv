Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My wife and I celebrated our first wedding anniversary at Bavette's and it was simply incredible. The steak was perfectly cooked, the creamed spinach was delicious, and the pommes frites with garlic aioli were phenomenal. The wine paired well with everything and our waiter brought us dessert for our anniversary. The service was excellent all around. We had a great time and would happily return for any special occasion.
