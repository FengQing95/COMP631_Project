Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So, I have to say... Lou's pizza.. is awesome! It's super! It's exactly how I will think of Chicago pizza from now on (I know I've said, Chicago way too much, but I can't help it). It's an actual pie with a great crisp crust; lots of filling (we had one sausage/meat and one spinach/veggie; meat was much better); a proportionate amount of cheese. Soo good. I may just order some online and have it delivered to me in Arlington!
