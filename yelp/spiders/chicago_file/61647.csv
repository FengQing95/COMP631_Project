Smoque BBQ////I enjoyed my visit to Smoque, everything I ate was tasty.  That being said, unless I happen to be in the neighborhood, in the mood for some bbq I doubt I'll be returning soon.  Personally, I think that there are a few spots in the city that are just as good if not better... still, If you haven't been I encourage you to try it.
