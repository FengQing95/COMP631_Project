Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Makes me want to quit eating steak in DC because everything else will just disappoint me after having this meal. No detail was spared. I mean, seriously. Absolutely perfect. Most restaurants have "weak spots" where some part of the dining experience is an afterthought and they compensate with their "star" dish(es). It could be a sloppy, cold lump of butter with the bread. It could be mediocre, sloppily poured drinks. It could be generic sides. Average sauces. Everything I ate was just honestly perfect.
