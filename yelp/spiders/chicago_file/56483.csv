Smoque BBQ////I get the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich with brisket and pork. It is fantastic every time. This place is out in the middle of nowhere so we've always driven, which is probably your best bet. The cornbread is also good and the slaw is great- not too sweet, which is what I like. I probably won't make it out to Smoque as much since my office moved down to the loop, and I will lament that for the rest of time.
