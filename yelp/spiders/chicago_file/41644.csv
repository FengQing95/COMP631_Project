Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is awesome for tapas. I take my family and friends here all of the time. it is a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant, so the prices are a bit high, but you're paying for quality food. They have great service, a big bar, and a huge menu. There is often a wait time on the weekends but again, it is well worth the wait and price. The atmosphere is nice and relaxed but I wouldn't roll in here in sweatpants. They have tapas, paella, paella cooking classes, sangria and great desserts. If you have a large group, it is fun to order a lot of dishes to share and explore their menu. Any of the "recommended" dishes on their menu are tasty. If you can, make a reservation and enjoy!
