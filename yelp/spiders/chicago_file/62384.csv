Smoque BBQ////I do not hesitate to make a trip out of coming here. It's a hell of a drive for me but it never disappoints. Pulled pork, brisket, fries, mac & cheese, baked beans. I have a hard time not ordering everything in one sitting. And the BBQ sauce is one of the best. Do not let the line scare you. It moves fast and they will get you a seat.
