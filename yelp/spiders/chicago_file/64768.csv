Smoque BBQ////After some extensive research prior to our trip to Chicago from LA , I found Smoque listed as one of the best bbq places in the area . And boyyyy were they right . This place was awesome, my boyfriend and I really enjoyed our meals and we were stuffed after eating about half . The brisket is super tender and literally falls apart when you pick it up, I even took a video to send to my bbq obsessed dad back home . The Memphis bbq sauce was my absolute favorite and I would buy it by the bottle if I could . Awesome food, thanks Smoque !!!
