Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Locals told me this place was incredible so during a weekend visit to Chicago, I took their word but was sorely disappointed. I loved the atmosphere, but the food fell way short of what my husband and I were expecting, given the rave reviews we'd heard about this place. We chose several items that were listed as the chef's specialties (including the shrimp in garlic and olive oil, spicy potatoes and endive salad), and all of them disappointed us. Food was a little greasy and left something to be desired. We won't be returning.
