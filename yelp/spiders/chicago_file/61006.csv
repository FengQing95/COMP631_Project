Smoque BBQ////I went there before the dinner rush so their was no wait.  I tried a half an order of each rib, the sliced brisket, and the tasting of pulled pork. For sides I tried the mac and cheese, fries, coleslaw, and peach cobbler.  Everything had really good flavor and was very smokey :) I would order the same things over and if I went with more people, maybe more of it!  The sides are really good also! Peach cobbler is so yummy!
