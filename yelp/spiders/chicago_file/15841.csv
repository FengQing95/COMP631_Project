Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My bill came out to $17 w/tip, which is a lot in my opinion for a personal pizza and a (small) salad that was way too big for me -- no drink because I got water. (I wanted one of those tiny salads I saw around, but I guess that was the one included in the lunch deal. Go figure.)
