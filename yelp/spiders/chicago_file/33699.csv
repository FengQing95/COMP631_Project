Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Ok so we just left. Here's what happened: my halibut came out a little undercooked - still so delicious that I was ready to eat the whole thing anyway, but my cautious hubby thought we should send it back for a little more time in the oven. Our server, Amy, was amazing and handled it like a pro: new piece halibut cooked to perfection plus a side of delicious broccoli for the trouble. When we get the bill, BOTH ENTREES HAD BEEN COMPED!!! Outstanding service. Just another reason why this is our favorite restaurant in Chicago.
