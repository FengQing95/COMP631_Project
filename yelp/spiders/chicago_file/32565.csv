Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////from the beginning our experience was not great.  the service in the bar was painfully slow.  there were four of us and not one of us got our drinks when the others did.  in all it was about 20 minutes before we all had a drink.  the food was average at best.  nothing noteworthy, as i was expecting after loving maude's.  we had the white ceaser, goat cheese, lamb chop, aged steak (the special that night) and the petite fillet (which came out 5 minutes after the other entrees were brought to our table).  the roasted broccoli was burnt and the hash browns over cooked.  how could they get it so wrong for such a nice restaurant?  we were really looking forward to our night (after waiting 3 months for the reservation) but it was a real disappoinment.
