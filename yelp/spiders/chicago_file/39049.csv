Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Extremely disgusted, disappointed w Bavettes tonite. We were told that we could walk in, as there are 3 tables in the middle that are for walk ins. We came, we were waiting for over an hour and a half. We saw over 8 parties being seated in the "walk in" section. I asked the hostess about it, and was told, "Oh, it's bc that lady's friend had been here before you". After seeing these shenanigans continue for over an hour and a half, we had enough of their bs. I had been excited to bring my mom here for the longest, and there was no excuse I could give my mom to stay another minute in this pathetic joke of an establishment. Too bad. I've spent BIG $$$$ here over the years, and even tho the food might be good, the crappy experience from tonite is enough for me to close the book on this place for good. I've worked in the food industry for years, enough to know when an establishment doesn't care about its patrons.
