Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love this place. Could literally eat here for days. Whether it's an intimate date or a pre-wedding party, every occasion I have new here for has not disappointed. It's a little dark if you don't like that but it works out great for dates, especially if you need something more private. Food is always top notch too, consistent.
