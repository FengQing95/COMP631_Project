Little Goat Diner////The food was so good we opted to split dessert: a "baby" blood orange meringue pie.  Wow!  Think "creamsicle" without all the nasty chemicals.  This was fresh, bright, gorgeous fruit concentrated into a pudding and poured over a crumbly, buttery crust.  The meringue was hands down the best I've ever tasted - stick-to-your-lips gooey with a simple, elegant flavor.
