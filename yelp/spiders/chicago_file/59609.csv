Smoque BBQ////The brisket is tender, juicy and sweet. I always add a side order to my chicken or rib order for a savory sandwich the day after. This is one of those places where I have to plan ahead, not my strong suit, otherwise it seems like the wait for service goes on forever. That said, it's always worth it.
