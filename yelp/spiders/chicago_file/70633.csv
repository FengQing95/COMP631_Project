Little Goat Diner////Wonderful flavors and good service. All four entrees for dinner were delicious and hard to come up with enough adjectives:  killer blue plate special shepherds pie like goat stew, goat patty melt, many flavors tuna melt (proclaimed best ever) and perfect fish tacos on crisp tostadas with avocado, slaw and chickpeas. All very reasonable prices.  Had the shrimp on lettuce wrap appetizer which was also perfect but not cheap (5 for $15).  Lively atmosphere and excellent mix on the draft beer selections. Arrived at about 530 on Sunday holiday weekend and had to wait about 35 minutes in the bar but got seated immediately when we got the you're next call.
