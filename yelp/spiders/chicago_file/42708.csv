Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The first time I went I thought it was good but there is just too much tapas competition in the city for me to give them a higher review or to go back. I know they are an institution and people love them but if you're traveling to Chicago and you want tapas, do your homework and go somewhere else.
