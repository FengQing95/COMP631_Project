Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////On Thursday night, we arrived at Lou Malnati's around 6 PM with many available seating opened and were seated right away. We glanced through the menu for a bit and decided to start with their Spinach stuffed bread. It sounded good and something Â I had not had before. For our entree, we decided on a small peperoni and mushroom deep dish. Yes, even though we are big eaters and love food, a small deep dish was all we needed.
