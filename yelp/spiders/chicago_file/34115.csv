Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Best steak in Chicago. Absolutely love this place. Everything about it is fantastic. The location, the decor, the drinks, the food and the staff are all awesome. The elote was just wow. Yeah, "wow." Only downside is you'll be hard pressed to get a reservation at a normal time (anything earlier than 9 PM). But, pro tip, the bar does serve the full menu and is usually empty enough to find a spot for 2 people.
