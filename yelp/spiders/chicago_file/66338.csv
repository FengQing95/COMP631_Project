Little Goat Diner////I love The Girl and The Goat, so I decided to try this place out.I went here for brunch on a Sunday and I was sat at the end of the counter. Normally I do not mind sitting at a counter, but I was right near the area where they drop dirty plates and it was extremely loud. Also, towards the end of my meal water leaked all over the floor Â in that area and the manager pulled a trash bin of dirty used napkins right in front of me so he could use the napkins to try to mop up the water on the floor. I really don't understand why he thought putting a trash can in front of a customer while they were eating was appropriate, even if the bin did not have trash in it.
