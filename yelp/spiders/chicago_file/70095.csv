Little Goat Diner////SERVICE: Our waiter was very friendly and patient with recommending dishes for us to try. However, the one time we tried to ask another waiter for something, we were met with a cold stare and the most reluctant trudge to our table I've ever seen. I'm not sure if this was a tip issue (does it go only to our server? I know it varies by restaurant) but that was disrespectful and unprofessional.
