Little Goat Diner////I was with 2 other people on a Friday night, trying to eat in this particular area without reservations. All of the other restaurants were well over 90 minute waits, while little goat was 45. They have a bar in the back that is perfect for waiting. I only had a glass of wine, which was good, so can't comment on their cocktails. They texted me after only 30 minutes, and we were seated in a booth. The decor and food are a very well done theme of upscale diner. Our waiter was pretty good and helped guide us through the menu. I ordered the machos nachos and they were amazing. The prices are much more affordable here than at The Girl & the Goat. Overall experience definitely earns 5 stars and I'll be back to try more of the menu!
