Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The Malnati Chicago Classic, Small Size, $14.95 prior to tax- If you come to Lou Malnati's, you have to get the Chicago classic. This deep dish masterpiece is topped with sausage, roma tomato marinara and extra cheese. Toppings are simple, but so perfect together(but you can add extra toppings at an additional cost if you want more). The small size gives you 4 large pieces (our server cut and served the pizza for us) and honestly could probably feed 3 people (you only need to eat one slice because it is really filling). The cheese is so oozey and wished I had more it. This is a must order!
