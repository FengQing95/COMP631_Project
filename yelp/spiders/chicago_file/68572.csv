Little Goat Diner////Came here for brunch... fully anticipated the VERY long wait, so put our name in, grabbed a cup of coffee and walked around the neighborhood.  We were hungry by the time our table was ready (60+min).  Really cute inside, although a bit noisy, but that's to be expected with how many people were there eating and waiting.
