Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The menu is of course tapas style and everything can be shared / ordered whenever during the meal. You must order the bacon wrapped dates, spicy potatoes, sangria, and the short rib. Pricing is very generous considering the service and excellent food. Book well ahead to get a table.
