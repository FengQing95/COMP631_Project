Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband came here on a Friday night around 6 and were seated in the parlor (lower level). The ambiance was dark but cozy. I would love to come again and eat on the main floor (it's a little brighter). Anyways, we started with the bone marrow with onion jam and parsley salad. This was perfect and we would come back here for this dish alone. We also loved the bread. We almost ate the entire basket.
