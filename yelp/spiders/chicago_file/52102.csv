Smoque BBQ////Pulled pork was surprisingly sub-par. With all the place had going for it, it was a bit dry and tasted only like sauce (which is tasty) but not the porky goodness that I love. Served on a giant bun of Hawaiian bread that added a nice sweetness but was too fluffy and should have probably been a bit denser.
