Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Brendan Sodikoff has created the perfect, dimly lit, eclectic spot. This is such a cool place. In a sea of restaurants that are more concerned with squeezing in as many patrons as possible day in day out, Bavette is a breath of fresh air. Â The ambiance is awesome. I absolutely loved the high ceilings which helped create the illusion of space in a place that has to be less than 1800 square feet. The seating arrangement is such a welcomed anomaly. It felt as if we were the only people in the room.
