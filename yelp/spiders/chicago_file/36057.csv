Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Very good steak and ambience, but service was rather poor.  First, I sat down and my chair was completely soaked in water.  The person before must have spilled an entire drink and didn't tell anyone.  So I sat through the entire dinner with wet pants and underwear and that wasn't the greatest feeling.  Not the restaurant's fault but wish they'd at least make up for a bad start with better service.  Anyway, waiter very abrupt and disinterested, looking around all the time while we were talking and placing orders.  He forgot our wine and ketchup.  Anyway steak was good but service just wasn't what I expected.
