Art Institute of Chicago////I really appreciated the layout of the rooms and the generally sequential nature of the thematic elements of the artwork. I also loved that the descriptions on the pieces listed the artists country of birth and where they mainly worked (i.e. Picasso was Spanish but mainly worked in France) as this gave us context for the pieces.
