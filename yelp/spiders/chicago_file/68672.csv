Little Goat Diner////I feel like everything here tastes amazing at first bite and then gets progressively worse the more you eat it. The nachos were good, the patty melt was essentially oil with a bit of meat and onions, and the smoked fries were simply nothing special. The decor is cute, the location is great. The service was disjointed. We sat outside and that seemed to confuse the wait-staff some, not to mention that we were all but forgotten at some point. Also, our server was extremely cocky--certainly too much of an attitude for my and my group's tastes.
