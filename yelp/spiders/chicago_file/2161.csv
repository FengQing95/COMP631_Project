The Purple Pig////I think the main reason why I give The Purple Pig 4 stars instead of 5 is because while some of the dishes were outstanding, some of them had unsuccessful components which didn't match the dish. Consistency is paramount, After all. Overall, I would definitely recommend going to The Purple Pig. Since this is a tapas place, three groups can have three completely different meals, and they could all be different. Just with my particular dishes, there wasn't consistency across the board. Still would go back, though!
