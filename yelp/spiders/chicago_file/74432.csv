Little Goat Diner////Made reservations with friends in advance to try this place I had heard great things about. Had a little trouble deciding between the Bahn Mi burger and the fish tostadas, but I hadn't had tostadas since before I was in the womb, so I decided right as I placed my order. The taste was pretty good, a little bit heavy to my surprise, but the flavor was quite unique: there was a nice balance of tang, richness and crispness from the cilantro. Will be back to try the Bahn Mi burger!
