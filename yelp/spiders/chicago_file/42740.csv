Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////While I don't think that this place (or really any other place, when there are so many great options in Chicago) is worth a 3-hour wait, we had some pretty tasty fare - some of the tapas we tried were the brussels sprout salad, tortilla espanola, goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, roast dates wrapped in bacon, and the chicken paella. All were good, but I especially enjoyed the brussels sprout salad and goat cheese. I wasn't a fan of the chicken paella, but my husband really liked it. FYI, you have to order a minimum of 2 servings of paella and that was more than enough - 2 servings is a HUGE portion. We definitely had to box some of the paella up to take with us.
