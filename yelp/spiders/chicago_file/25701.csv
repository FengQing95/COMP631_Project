Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When in Chicago, eat deep dish pizza. I ordered a personal size dish of the Malnati's Classic Chicago Pizza. It was crowded, but I was alone so had a chance to sit at the bar. The pizza takes a little over 30 minutes to cook so they also have a bar to order drinks. When the pizza came out it was hot and fresh. Everything tasted so fresh and all the ingredients tasted high quality. The crust was crispy and buttery, sauce tasted of fresh tomatoes, cheese was plentiful for every bite, and sausage was meaty and fresh. I'm not a big fan of Chicago deep dish in general, I'm more of a thin crust pizza fan, but I would recommend this place!
