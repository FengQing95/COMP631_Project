Little Goat Diner////The lady and I came here after a great experience at girl and the.goat a few days earlier.  This restaurant fully flushes out its concept of a high end diner, and totally delivers on the quality of food.  We split the Goat Joe and Party Melt.  The goat was noticeably leaner than a traditional.sloppy Joe and the Patty melt was juicy with a pronounced flavor of grass fed beef.  To finish, stumptown coffee and spices.pear topped cheesecake.  More light than the average pie and amazingly delicate crust....love chef Izzard.
