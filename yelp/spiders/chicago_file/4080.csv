The Purple Pig////Milk Braised Pork Shoulder - When this came out, we were in pain from all the food jammed into our bellies.  I don't think we gave this dish a fair shot in all honesty because everyone was so full.  The little bit I tried was very good, but I had to put the fork down...same goes for my two dinner companions.
