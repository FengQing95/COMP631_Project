Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Believe the hype, my new favorite steak place in Chicago.  Cocktails were great, Cognac Sazeracs went down way too easily, apps were so good, especially the salmon tartar.  I had the classic Chicago cut rib-eye and it was cooked to perfection, I really don't think I've ever had a better steak and I've been to almost every other steakhouse in Chicago.  The sides were great too, we had the creamed spinach and of course the much raved about elote style corn (which lives up to the reviews).  Even though I'm not a dessert person I couldn't resist the whiskey ice cream and it was delicious.  It's tough to get a good reservation for good reason, apply now.
