Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was ravenous when we finally arrived here! I only ate one meal the day before and it took us an hour to get here because we were lost on our bikes. The deep dish Chicago style pizza takes 30 minutes, so we ordered an appetizer and salad, stat. I ate a lot, my friends commented on how they never seen me eat so much before.
