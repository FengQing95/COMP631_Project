Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our server was super helpful and explained the menu to us. We ordered the deviled egg tapa and patatas bravas to start with. They were both great! To drink, we both had the sangria. It was not super strong..it was more sweet (but that's how I like it!). For our entr√©e, we ordered the Paella with pork. We were surprised at how fast it was done. The menu said 45 minutes, but we're almost certain it was a shorter wait than that. It was super filling and delicious. Lots of great flavors and smells came from the Paella!
