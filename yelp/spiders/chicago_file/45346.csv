Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////-If you're looking for a deal, they do offer happy hour specials ($1 and $3 dishes) at the bar with less expensive deals on some of their most popular dishes.  However, the portion sizes are also small to match so if you're eating a lot, I'm not sure how much of a deal they really are.  A few of my faves are also not on this menu so I end up ordering from the regular menu.
