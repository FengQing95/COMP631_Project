Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////We ordered coffee drinks and our food. The coffee drinks took a while to come out, we actually got our food before our coffee, but our server told us that the, erm, coffee-maker-person? Whatever it's called, anyway, she told us right off that he was the only one making the drinks and he was a bit behind. No problems with us, it happens.
