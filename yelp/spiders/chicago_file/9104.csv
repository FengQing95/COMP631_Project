Art Institute of Chicago////Such a beautiful museum. I have lived here for 10 years and was excited to take my brother and his girlfriend here. At closing though the workers are the rudest people ever. We couldn't even use the bathroom because there was a worker guarding the door at 5:01. I was really considering getting a membership but I won't be now because of how rude everyone is who works there.
