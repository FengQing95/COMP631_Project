Little Goat Diner////The nachos were huge!  Enough for 2 or 3 people to eat dinner off of. They look fantastic, but flavors wise, I've had better. The chips seemed stale and the chips are topped with a white cheese sauce that completely disappointed. The cheese cause was almost like Alfredo, something made with flour so it was a little gritty. Could have used some spicy.  I did eat at an odd time, 3 pm, so not sure if I got old chips and cheese. I definitely think the chips were rebaked.
