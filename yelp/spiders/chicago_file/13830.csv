Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I know the pizzas take forever to cook and they were busy. Ours took over 45 minutes to get to our table.  Please understand that I have been telling my husband about this pizza since February. I swear to god, it was the best pizza I've ever eaten.  I even ate super light for two days to save calories for it. So it gets to our table and it was LUKEWARM!  I was heartbroken :(
