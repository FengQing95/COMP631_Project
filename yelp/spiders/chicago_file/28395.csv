Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's is my favorite Chicago deep dish pizza! And the butter crust is mainly why I love this pizza. When you are eating such a heavy and hearty pizza, the soft, buttery crust compliments it so well. I love to order the deep dish pizza with sausage and giadinera which gives the pizza a nice spicy flavor.
