Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////1) The tapas came out all at once. While I understand this is kind of the idea, when you have 12 people ordering 8 different menu items, in quantities of 3-4 each, Â plus drinks, the table gets a bit crowded if they all come out at once. Maybe bring a few out at a time, especially as the latter parts of the evening saw the wait staff disappear. Not only did it make for a crowded table, but contrary to what I've known about Spanish dining (or good dining in general, is that it made the meal feel rushed, like they were trying to get us out the door ASAP.
