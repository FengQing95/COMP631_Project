Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love vodka...so naturally I love bloody mary's, real bloodys - as opposed to a fake one with tomato juice and a celery stick...ba-ba-reeba has THE BEST bloodys. Top shelf vodka (yessss) and as many (quality) fixins your cup can fit. Â I'm creaming - it's that damn good. Oh ya, their tapas son muy deliciosos.
