Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I can't believe I never wrote a review here as this used to be my favorite Lincoln Park Spanish place! Been here numerous times and what I remember most is their incredible PEACH sangria. In fact, I've had both the red and the white, but nothing compares to the peachy, white, delicious flavor of this one. We always get it. The atmosphere is really cute, very Barcelona style, however it does get a little loud for my taste, but the more of that Sangria that you drink, the less you will mind. Now onto the food, everything we had here was delicious from the calamari, both grilled and fried, the garlic shrimp, the potatoes, I mean you name it, it's good here! This place just screams, "YOU WILL HAVE A GOOD TIME HERE NO MATTER WHAT!" Oh and I definitely remember the banana and ice cream dessert--it resembles something interesting ;)
