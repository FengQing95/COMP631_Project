Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Hands down way better than Giordano's! Love their buttery crust. Ordered half the classic and the Lou. The Lou was soooooo good! It's less than cheesy than Giordano's but that's why I like it better. It's less greasy and way more flavorful instead of just cheese. The line was so long even at 5 o'clock. We put our name down and went to a bar next door to chill until it was ready. You can order ahead so the food will be out by the time you are seated. We waited about 1 hour.
