Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////So it's my first time trying this place out but I was a little disappointed. I went there with my friends that have been there before. We pre ordered the seafood paella before we got there so when we were seated it wouldn't take long. The paella was bland and salty. The texture was good but just wasn't flavorful.
