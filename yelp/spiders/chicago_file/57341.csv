Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is wonderful I feel like they're losing a little bit of their spunk however. The staff the past few times have been forgetful and not as lively. I still recommend this place to people however I think to make this place a little better is a deep cleaning and maybe a good staff training on reminding your face to smile. Gotta work for them tips hunny! Nah, I'm just teasing but I love the idea of shared apps and this place has been good to me in the past. I think a facelift is in need.
