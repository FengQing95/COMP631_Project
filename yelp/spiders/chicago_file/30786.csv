Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ordered a delivery which took two hours to arrive, which was fine and expected, but the food was not good so this definitely seemed like a waste of time. Ordered one of the house famous pizzas, but it came without sauce and needed more flavor. Not a fan of the "lean sausage" as it does not add anything to the meal.
