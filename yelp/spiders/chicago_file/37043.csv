Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I arrived here on a Friday night with no reservation and my party of 4 was seated immediately (Au Cheval had a 3.5 hour wait). Skeptical of the quality of the food based on the nonexistent wait time we ordered what we referred to as a "snack" since we had plans to hit up 2 additional restaurants the same evening.
