The Purple Pig////The pork tongue is served in thin delicate slices with a creamy white sauce. The tongue was so tender, and had a real smoky/peppery flavor I Â loved. The crispy pig's ear was also tasty. I've had cold pig ear before, but this was my first time trying it fried and I loved it. Almost like onion strings but way better. The lamb's rib was HUGE! We couldn't finish it all, but no less tasty. It was fall-off-the-bone tender. And we can't forget the caviar and ice cream. Served on this wafer thin waffle fry chip, it was gorgeous and tasted as good as it looked. The ice cream was whipped to perfection and made a nice compliment to the salty caviar.
