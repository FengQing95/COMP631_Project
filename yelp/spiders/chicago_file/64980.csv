Smoque BBQ////But today, my husband and I finally W`E`N`T to Smoque.   Yes, I was warned that their place is small and to avoid busy meal times.   So, of course, we went around 12:30pm.  Oh well.   But while we were waiting in line to order, a gentleman asked how many in our party.  I'm so glad they did not place that burden on us.  This way, they had an employee looking for seating for any guests who were dining.   And before our number was even called, this gentleman had found a seat for us.
