Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I'm fairly certain this restaurant doesn't need another reviewer but I would like to add my 2 cents to it.  This is my FAVORITE tapas place in the city.  The food makes this place worth coming to EVERYTIME.  I admit, it's not THAT cheap, but a great dinner every once in a blue moon should be well deserved, don't cha think?!
