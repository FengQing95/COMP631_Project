Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As I said in a posting about Giordano's, this whole-deep dish pizza thing is more highly subjective than most other foods debates: best chile, best Mexican, best hot dog, etc. Everybody has his or her own unshakeable opinion. Lou Malnati's in River North was recommended to me and my friend by absolutely everybody we met in Chicago -- and absolutely everybody we met spelled or pronounced it hilariously wrong! How we ever found it, I will never know. New Menotti's, Louis Minnetti's, Vincent Minnelli's -- you name it. And nobody we met could think of that place featured (as superb) by Anthony Bourdain on "No Reservations". So at Lewis MacNutty's, we had this: The "Malnati Chicago Classic": Lou Malnati's is legendary for its pizza in the pan, and here, sausage is the specialty of the house. Made with Lou's exclusive blend of lean sausage, some extra cheese, and vine-ripened tomato sauce on our famous Buttercrust.™ It's authentic Chicago!"  We found the sausage and trademarked Buttercrust.™ delightful, but very bland and rather non-Italian tasting. So, I cannot fully recommend Sue MacNaughlty's, especially at crowded family hour when even the seats that are not seats are packed with parents and screaming children eating or waiting in hungry packs. But I must say, the Cubs fans sitting at the bar watching the game were remarkably quiet, even when their team suddenly was ahead by several runs
