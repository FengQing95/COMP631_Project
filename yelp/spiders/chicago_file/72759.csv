Little Goat Diner////All in all, this place is a lot of hype! But its delicious.  I think the best time to visit is immediately after work around 5:30 PM.  I have not heard a single person wait more than a minute at that time.  I will revisit the Little Goat, but the food was not good enough for me to wait more than 15 minutes for a table.
