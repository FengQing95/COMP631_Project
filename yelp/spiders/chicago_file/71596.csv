Little Goat Diner////This is not your dad's diner. Everything that seems traditional in title has some unique twist or addition that you'd never imagine. We started with the goat chili cheese fries which were so indulgent we were almost too full for our sandwiches! I had the grilled cheese which had a decent flavor but was too greasy to finish, unfortunately. Overall it was a cool place, kind of hipstery, but a little more expensive than somewhere I'd want to eat regularly.
