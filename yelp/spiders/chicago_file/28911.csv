Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It worked out perfect since we had finished our boat architecture tour and had to walk to the restaurant. I called ahead and ordered a small pepperoni pizza. We just had lunch before the tour and was full but still had to get some Pizza. They said it'd be ready in 15 minutes.
