Little Goat Diner////Hi, I recently visited Little Goat for a late lunch.  I ordered the apple pancakes and my friend the chicken sandwich with fries.  To start, the wait was about 20 minutes but what was odd was that when we were sent a text that our table was ready, we had to wait another 10minutes.  I was curious that no one was coming to get us for the table.  I then  went to the counter again and the lady said that they were wondering what happened to us, even though we had come up to the counter earlier.  When we were seated, the table was half cleaned and then I noticed stains on the wall beside me.
