Little Goat Diner////Smoked Pork and Toffee Milkshake - My friend lives and dies by this shake so I had to try it. It's actually really good with a not too overbearing smoky pork flavor and mixed with a healthy amount of little bits of toffee to balance it out. Recommend spooning the milkshake as the toffee bits will clog the straw.
