Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The last time I was here was over 5 years ago when I lived in Michigan and I do not remember anything about what I had tried back then. I would not call this an authentic Spanish tapas, but quite tasty nonetheless and the company I had even better. And if it is even worth mentioning, much, much better tapas I had at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba than any of the places that I had tried in Bay Area.
