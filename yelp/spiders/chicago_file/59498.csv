Smoque BBQ////Corn muffins come in individual tins and have whole pieces of corn interspersed. Coleslaw isn't my thing, but it is mayo-free. The mac n cheese tastes deliciously terrible for you and it's impossible to stop eating. Great baked beans, and sweet, smooshy 2 hand rolls make this place a great place to add to the list.
