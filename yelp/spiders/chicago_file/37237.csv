Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////What a fabulous place! I loved the ambience of Bavettes. The food was delicious and incredibly filling. Marvelous wine list and creative cocktails. We tried the bone marrow, duck terrine, bone in ribeye, Brussels sprouts, truffle mac and cheese, and finished the celebratory meal with a large slice of carrot cake topped with goldbrick sauce. I was very pleased with choosing this steakhouse out of the others I researched. I enjoyed being able to family style our meal to try several different items. We will be back!
