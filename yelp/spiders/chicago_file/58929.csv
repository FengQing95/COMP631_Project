Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We went here as a group of 8. We had a nice table where we could talk! You need to wear your mask until you get to your table. This place is known for their tapas. They are the famous small dishes of Spain. We created  a meal with a variety of tapas, and  enjoyed one of their paellas as our main course. We had 1/2 pitcher of blood orange sangria (delicious) and ordered a bunch of items-one was  mac and cheese for our little guy with bacon on the side.
