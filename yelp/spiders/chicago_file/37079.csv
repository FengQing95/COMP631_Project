Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Filet mignon was raved about by others, but I do not think I will get that again if I ever come back. Service was also not worth 5 stars. Waiter spilled when he poured my water and was not attentive enough to my drinking needs (tea, water for my cold). Â Really good place for a romantic date and you want to be close to the person.
