Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I'm giving Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba full points for the originality of tapas for brunch and the vibe there is so cool (I love the wall of bread), but some of the food was hit of miss. The sausage fried paella rice was super bland and the pancakes were just so-so, but the French toast (especially the butter) blew me away, and I usually never order a sweet option at brunch.
