Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Dinner for two for under $30, really?! And the food was fantastic. Try the classic dish pizza with sausage cheese and butter crust. This is unbelievably delicious. They don't skimp here. We also threw in a Caesar salad for less than nine dollars and it included chicken! All this with family atmosphere timely friendly service and a taste of Chicago that I'll never forget. Thanks Lou
