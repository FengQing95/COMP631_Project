Art Institute of Chicago////I have been visiting the museum since I was a kid and have always loved it.  The special installations are done amazingly well.  I usually have to drop by the Impressionists, but my favorite painting is by Seurat (A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte)...probably since we had a print in my living room as a kid.  In any case, a stop in the Thorne rooms is also a must!
