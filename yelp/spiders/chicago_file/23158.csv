Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I must start off with I'm not a fan of Chicago pizza. Every time I come here I search for good Chicago pizza and I just haven't found it. Anyway this place came highly recommended. So the good this is all the places I've tried have been consistent, but unfortunately I'm not a fan. I figured out it's because the dough tastes like beer and I don't like beer. Also the tomato sauce tends to be sweet which I also don't like. Â I don't think this place did anything wrong though.
