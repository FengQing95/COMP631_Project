Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great friendly vibes and loved the sports memorabilia  that decorated the walls.  The staff was prompt, friendly and made great recommendations on sizes/portions for the group. Now let's get to the pizza...One of my favs for Chicago deep dish.  Good ratio of cheese, crust and sauce.     Recommend getting there early to help with the wait as it is very very popular.
