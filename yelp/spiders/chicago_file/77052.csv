Little Goat Diner////I was on a carb binge since we landed in Chicago so I went to alternate route and got a salad. Goat'O-Goat'O, interesting name with an explosion of flavors in every bite. Veggies, shrimp, and a tamarind peanut dressing. The smell of the dressing was pungent and I was curious at first but after you drizzle that baby on top of everything... LORD HAVE MERCY. I need this recipe! The serving was gigantic ($14), I couldn't finish all of it. Definitely a staple to come back for.
