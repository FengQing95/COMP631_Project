Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Omg!! Definitely worth all the hours of waiting for that truly authentic Chicago deep dish. We went with simple cheese but it was so flavorful and I wanted more and more. I would recommend the location on North Wells St. as the one to go to! They have great staff and awesome service!
