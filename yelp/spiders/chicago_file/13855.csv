Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Thank you for your feedback, Nati. Though I'm happy you enjoyed the Malnati Salad, I am sorry to hear about the disappointing pizza you received. If you're open to it, our manager would like to speak with you about your experience. I will send you a private message so we can follow up with you directly. Thank you for writing a review and bringing this to our attention.
