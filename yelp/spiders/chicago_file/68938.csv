Little Goat Diner////I ordered poached eggs that came back lookIng hard boiled twice, so I gave up. I expected the biscuits and gravy to knock my socks off, it was mediocre. My version, the group agreed, is superior. So, I was not impressed with my meal. Other groups in our party did enjoy what they had ordered, so I added a star.
