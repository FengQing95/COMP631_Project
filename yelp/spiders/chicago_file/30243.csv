Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////#1 reason why I love Lou's versus Gino's? The crust. Lou's crust is cooked perfectly, unlike Gino's that takes away the flavor of the pizza with their cornbread style crust. The pizza is also extremely flavorful and the service there is great. Plus, they have more than one location in Chicago, which I love.
