The Purple Pig////The Roasted Bone Marrow with Herb Salad and Sicilian Sea Salt was one of my favorites of the night. And it may have been with just my first bite of the Herb Salad alone! This salad coupled with some crusty bread and then topped with a smear of the roasted bone marrow and an added sprinkle of Sicilian Sea Salt was perfection. The textures and flavors worked harmoniously well!
