Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So, do I recommend? Maybe if you're very very VERY interested in deep dish pizza but I probably wouldn't want this to be my first deep dish experience as it wasn't too convincing. Would I return? Unlikely. Food was mediocre despite some interesting notes, but service was notoriously abhorrent and unorganized. I am sure there are better deep dish pizza out there.
