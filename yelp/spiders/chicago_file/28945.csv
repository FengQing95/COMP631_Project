Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The food is great. I wouldn't eat it on the regular because it's so heavy. But, it's a great representation of deep dish, if you've never had it. The service is two star- I've had better. The atmosphere is four star- so lively and fun, but overly crowded. I do wish there was more space in this restaurant or a bigger entrance to wait in.
