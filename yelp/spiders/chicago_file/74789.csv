Little Goat Diner////Not impressed and SO Disappointed. I was really looking forward to coming here after seeing all of the positive reviews. First, all the hostesses seemed to be in a very cranky mood. They said the wait would be ~20 minutes and so we sat at the bar hoping for a baked good and drink while we waited. The bartender was cleaning glasses, while we sat for a few minutes waiting for someone to clean up the leftover mess from the customers sitting before us. He never said that he would be with us in a moment. After 5 minutes of waiting, I got a text that our table was ready. Went to the hostess and she said that it would be ready in a moment. We then stood for another 5 minutes at the hostess' desk waiting. As I was sat at the booth, I took my hand to brush off the crumbs on my seat.
