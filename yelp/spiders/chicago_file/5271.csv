The Purple Pig////The roasted bone marrow was probably the best dish that we ordered. It was recommended by our friend and definitely enjoyed it. It came with some baguettes and arugula. The pasta was probably the most unexpected dish. It was basically ravioli wrapped with a goat cheese filling. The goat cheese was overpowering and extremely creamy. It was definitely one of the worst dish that we had. The pork shoulder also took forever to come out. We were done with our dishes and the pork shoulder was still not out yet. The pork was alright. It was a bit dried but paired with the mashed potatoes, it was manageable. Lastly, the cheese platter was great! The cheese was light and refreshing. It came with some cracker bites and jelly. The combination was to die for!
