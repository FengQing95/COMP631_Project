Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Had the lunch special deep dish personal pizza - tried to add a few items and was told by the bartender it would take 45 minutes to prepare if I did so.  So I stuck with the cheese/sausage menu item.  It arrived smothered in inexpensive industrial grade tomato sauce, the sausage and crust were the same quality - cheap and not good - very little cheese, mainly tomato sauce.  No personality and have had better frozen pizzas.  Does not do Chicago proud I am sorry to say.
