Smoque BBQ////When we came here, the line was out the door and wrapped around the block!  The BBQ smell filled the air and I was so anxious to eat.  I had the sampler and had some very tender beef brisket (half sliced , half chopped), some scrumptious pulled pork, and some fall off the bone ribs.  Everything was cooked to perfection.
