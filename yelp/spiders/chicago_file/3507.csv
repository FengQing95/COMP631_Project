The Purple Pig////Crowded was an understatement for this place and they don't take reservations.  So you gots to pick a good time to come here.  Preferably aim for when they open or 2-5pm (after lunch crowd), it really picks back up in the evening and into the night.  Everything here is small plates so it's perfect for sharing, or if you're a pig like me you don't have to share *oink*oink*
