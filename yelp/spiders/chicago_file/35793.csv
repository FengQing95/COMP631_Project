Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////One last thing I'll mention about this great restaurant was the corkage fee, or lack thereof. I typically like to bring my own unique bottle of wine to restaurants and just pay the fee. Bavette's, however, does not have a fee; instead, they suggest you share one of your glasses with someone else in the restaurant (e.g. random patron, hostess, waiter). I thought this was unique and very cool (as did the random guy we ended up giving the glass to). Perfect meal. Perfect night. Thanks, Bavette's.
