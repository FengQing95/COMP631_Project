Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ok this place is GOOD, it's really good!  However, to contribute to the never ending debate in Chicago as to who as the best pizza I'm going to stick to Giordano's.  You can't really go wrong with either.  But at Lou Malnati's I felt the "butter crust" they are famous for was a little too thin.  I like a deeper crust with more toppings.  Give both a shot and decide what your preference is, this place is still TASTY as hell!
