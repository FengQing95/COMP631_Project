Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came here our first night in Chicago. The area was pretty quiet considering it was a Saturday night. There was a line to check in and the process was pretty easy, you give your name and number and how many in your party and they give you a wait time. Then the check in lady had us go in and preorder the pizza you want. We came in expecting to wait so that wasn't really an issue for us. We waited about an hour and a half before they text us that our table was ready. Since they text you there is NO REASON for you to be waiting inside the restaurant and we were baffled at how many people were inside when we got in there. Trying to find the spot to check back in was difficulty because of the amount of people that were crowded around for no actual reason.
