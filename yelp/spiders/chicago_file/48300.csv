Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Met a friend here for dinner while I was in town.  First of all, it's much bigger than it looks from the outside.  Inside has a dark, funky atmosphere.  Service was good, and the food was delicious.  We shared a whole bunch of things, and every one of them was very well executed.  I'm a fan of tapas in general, and would definitely recommend this place.
