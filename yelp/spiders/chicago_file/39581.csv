Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As my original review stated, there was nothing wrong with the dinner itself; the steak was fantastic as were the sides. But as most lovers of top tier steakhouses know, the ambiance and atmosphere is critical to the experience....eating a $90 Prime Rib on picnic table next to a road being freshly tarred does not make for a memorable meal, the entire experience quantifies the real caliber of the meal. The service, the environment, the food combines to create a nexus of the time spent there and the elements cannot be easily separated. When the atmosphere is offensive, it ruins the rest. That's what happened to us.
