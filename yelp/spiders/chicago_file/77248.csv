Little Goat Diner////If I had to recommend one item on the menu it would be the tempura mashed potatoes. Order them. Actually, order multiple orders, and you'll still want more. The batter used was flavorful and perfectly crisp, and the pickled slaw garnish was a perfect compliment in both flavor and texture.
