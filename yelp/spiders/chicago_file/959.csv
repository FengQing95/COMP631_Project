Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This is the place to go if you're tired of hotel breakfast. I had easy over egg, bacon, Pumpkin Â spice pancakes and coffee. The eggs and bacon were cooked exactly like I would do at home. Pancakes were a hit. The servicr here is excellent, waiters are attentive and bus staff is constantly cleaning up. Break away from the hotel and try this place.
