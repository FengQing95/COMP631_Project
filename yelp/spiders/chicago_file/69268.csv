Little Goat Diner////Went here yesterday after a fun day with the bestie at the Randolph Street Market a few blocks away! I had a hard time deciding what to get because everything looked so freakin amazing! I finally opted for the blue plate special of the day: Beef Heart Gyros served on top of white wine marinated eggplant (house-made marinade is sold in the store next door), which is topped on a layer of homemade hummus, which is layered on top of homemade fluffy naan (baked fresh in the BAKERY next door), which is all layered with guess what, HOMEMADE tzatziki sauce, fresh cucumber and tomato slices on top. FREAKIN amazing. The bestie had the goat burger - with all the usual toppings of lettuce, cheese, tomatoes - she said it was one the most delicious burgers shes had.
