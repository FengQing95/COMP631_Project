Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnatis was our first stop on our weekend trip to Chicago. Coming from Los Angeles, my girlfriend and I were very eager to sink our teeth into some deep dish! Initially, I was not very impressed. It was a bit thin, and lacking sauce. The cheese however, was fantastic. What really saved this slice was the butter crust, good lord those bites where the crust met the cheese and sauce were just magic! We were stuffed with two slices each. While I can't say it was the best I had that weekend, it was definitely special.
