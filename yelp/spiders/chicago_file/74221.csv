Little Goat Diner////A fun diner in a fun neighborhood. My wife and I enjoy hanging out here and trying their interesting renditions on classic American diner food. The chickpea salad is one of my tops as well as the shrimp and grits. My dad loves the veggie burger. Truth be told there's nothing on the menu here that's "bad" - it's all super solid, well executed and pretty darn delicious. They always got something for m everyone. Also, it appears that they've expanded their pastry menu within the last year or so, that's a plus!!
