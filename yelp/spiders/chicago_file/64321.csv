Smoque BBQ////The food was the real highlight though. I opted for the chopped brisket plate with a choice of 2 sides and slaw for ~$14. The portion of meat was substantial and I had plenty to take home. The meat is definitely the center piece at Smoque, with all meats served with two sauces on the side. Â Meats are paired with specific sauces that complement the cuts and flavorings of the dish and I enjoyed the contrast of the two sauces that came with my meal - one was a thick and creamy mesquite sauce and the other was a brisket-specific, vinegar based sauce. Both were tasty! I hoped the brisket would compete with the likes of some of the Austin BBQ I've tried, but it didn't quite get there. A pretty solid Chicago alternative, but I've still gotta make the trek to ATX the best of brisket country.
