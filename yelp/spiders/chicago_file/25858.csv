Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was not disappointed. Chicago classic with add on mushrooms and green peppers delivered. Loved the butter crust. Next time, I plan to try pepperoni instead of sausage. The layer of sausage was a bit too much for me, but overall this deep dish has a slight edge over Gino's. And that is high praise.
