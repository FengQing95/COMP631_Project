Smoque BBQ////They have a clean up crew that will take your tray and trash when you have finished and will wipe the table down.  It would be nice to have wet naps  so you could clean your hands at the table.  When it's crowded it's a struggle to get to the restrooms to hose off.  Prices were OK but they don't offer a half and half platter so you can sample two different meats.  Instead you need to order one (like pulled pork) then do the "add a side" for $3.00.  If you love smoked meats, you need to try their chicken.
