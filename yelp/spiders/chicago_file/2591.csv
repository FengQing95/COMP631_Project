The Purple Pig////Yep, you're crammed in like sardines; but, let it happen and enjoy what comes next: delightful dishes made with care and enthusiasm. Lively people, excellent staff, really nummy plates. Start up a convo with your neighbor when you see their dishes and wait for the food coma to get ya. Worth the wait and price. Get a Joan Collins...she knows what's up.
