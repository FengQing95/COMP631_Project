Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////-We tell Julio the steak is bad and just give it back. He offers half of my steak to my husband [he doesn't know that I don't share well, but that's fine- I want my husband to eat] as a remedy, and asks if there's "anything else?" No apology, no nothing. Julio goes to the kitchen, and comes back with a retort "the kitchen says that cut generally has more fat on it". A little fat is one thing. The piece that he got was a mess. Ok, so I give up half of my steak, but they took my husband's fork and knife with the steak and forgot to mark the table again, and now he can't eat. So, we have to ask for silverware.
