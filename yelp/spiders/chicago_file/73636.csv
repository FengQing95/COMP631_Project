Little Goat Diner////We started with fried pickles with 2 dipping sauces, ranch and curry. They were sweet pickles which combined nicely with the curry sauce. The smoky fries only had a hint, very slight hint of hickory? I wasn't impressed with them. The shrimp & grits were good and I loved the bits of brussel sprouts in it, but, too much sauce, not enough grits, and over cooked shrimp made it just an ok dish. The jack-o-lantern (pumpkin) Shake had just the right amount of pumpkin flavor with a hint of ginger- very tasty!
