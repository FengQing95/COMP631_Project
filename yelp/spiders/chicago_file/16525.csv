Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm a nay-sayer.  What can I say?  My sister and my nieces love Lou Malnati's, and it's their favorite Chicago-style pizza (with the exception of the sausage . . . they don't like the sausage . . . it's in chunks).  Every time I visit them in Chicago, we seem to eat at Lou Malnati's, and after several visits, it's safe to say that I don't see the big deal.  I don't love the crust; I don't love the sauce; and it's not stuffed in the same way that other stuffed pizza restaurants are.  There is no top layer of crust to the pizza.  Rather, it's more of a deep pan pizza without a doughy crust.  So, the toppings (or rather, fillings) fill the pan and are topped off with sauce.  That style isn't what gives me reserve.  It's the pizza itself.  I don't like it that much.  The crust is more crunchy than I like.  The sauce is not balanced.  Never loved the cheese either.
