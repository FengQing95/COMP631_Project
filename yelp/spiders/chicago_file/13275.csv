Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place is a menace to the waistlines of Chicago.  Great food and the price we good.  We waiting a long time for seating, waiting outside on the street. That's the only negative I have, and for me that's huge, and I still give them 4 stars!  The classic deep dish pizza is awesome.  The  cheese and spinach stuffed bread is great.  The salad was "good".  The portions on the pasta we ordered were huge, the child's size isn't bad for an adult, and the adult size would feed 2.
