Smoque BBQ////This weekend I was fortunate enough to experience the greatness that is Smoque. Prior to going, I had heard nothing, but positive feedback about this BBQ joint. Obviously, stakes were placed pretty high and in the end Smoque did deliver. I was absolutely blown away by how great this food tastes. While eating there I found myself in a trance and before I knew it my 1/2 pulled pork 1/2 chopped brisket sandwich with side Â of coleslaw and beans was consumed. Long story short, if you are a BBQ lover it's essential you check this place out.
