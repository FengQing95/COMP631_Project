Art Institute of Chicago////The modern art collection was as enriching and as interesting as the Tate Modern in London. The impressionism was captivating, and the Asian are exhibit held a special place in my heart. I was able to see the famous "American Gothic" with out a huge security barrier, and had there been one, it would have made it less impressive. I found this display of "miniatures" in the basement. The collection was huge and the attention to detail was incredible! And I think my favorite area was the Renaissance. Not only did I come face to face with a Rossetti, but I also got to see some pieces or armor from antiquity.
