The Purple Pig////So I know there is a HUGE hype around this restaurant but I just don't think it was worth the 2 hour wait. I get that this is Tapas so the plates will be small, but it is very highly priced and my group of 3 got 5 plates and were still hungry. We each paid around $40 for these 5 plates. My friend thought he had ordered a $15 glass of wine but instead was charged $30. He asked about it and the waitress said he chose the $30 one so it was a bit suspicious. The service was not great at all. My friend was horrified by the asparagus because it was like the thinnest pieces ever of asparagus however I loved the flavors and wish there was just thicker pieces. Flavor is good on the dishes but if there is a 2 hour wait I'd say pass on this restaurant! I'm sure there are much more affordable tapas places!
