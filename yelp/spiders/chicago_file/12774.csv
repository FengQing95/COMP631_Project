Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Today was my daughter's 18th birthday. Her suburban friends met up with us in the city for a bowling party and lunch at Lou Malnati's -  my suggestion due to the quality of pizza and service we have had in the past.  PAST is the operative word.  I first tried to make a reservation for 9 people in the AM but was denied. The staff told me to call about 45 minutes prior to getting there to pre-order. I attempted that and was told that I could not do so as there was a 30 minute wait and was told to come in.  My wife left my daughter's party early to not inconvenience our guests and when she arrived at the restaurant, the restaurant was far from full with 3 staff members standing around talking at the front reception area.  When she asked why we could not pre-order, she was told that they were probably busy when I called.  She then pre-ordered while they got the table ready at 2PM. We arrived and had to wait until 3PM for our pizzas which were not even hot. Our server was non-existent leaving us without water and pizzas my wife served along with the salad. This was the worst service I have ever received and no one on the staff said Happy Birthday to my daughter after they were informed of the occasion.  We have been long time customers and have frequented both the Gold Coast and River North locations and would have expected hot food and quality service which we did not get.  Very disappointing as it was supposed to be a great day and her friends who were first time guests who did not have a positive first impression of Lou Malnati's. Not planning on coming back or ever recommending again.
