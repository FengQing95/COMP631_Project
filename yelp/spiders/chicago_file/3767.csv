The Purple Pig////A very eclectic restaurant. It's family-style seating here and next to strangers.  Everything here is a small plate meant to be shared kind of like tapas. The menu changes daily and there are a few every day items such as the fried deviled eggs.  We ordered a rigatoni with chicken Bolognese sauce that was excellent, a beet dish with whipped goat cheese that was excellent, shrimp with blood sausage, and rabbit with sausage. Everything was cooked order and really good. The seating situation though can get cramped and untenable at times.  It's very noisy and very crowded and there is generally a way to get in. The house mixed drinks are excellent and interesting.  Service was very good and we were constantly attended two with plates being put in front of us and removed all night long.    Purple pig is definitely a place you want to try at least once.
