Little Goat Diner////I ended up with the loco moco hamburger dish since I eyed it at a table next to me, it looked irresistible. The loco moco was: asian inspired fried rice, a handsome beef patty, a fried egg, and some kind of tomato-y asian salsa. I didn't think it was the best thing on the menu, but it was still pretty tasty.
