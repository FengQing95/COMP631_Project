Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went here last night on a first date and it was the shiiii. My date heard about this from Yelp, so WHAT UP YELP :) Lauren was our server, and she was BALLER. Very honest, pleasant, informative, and friendly - very cool. If you go, Â I'd say order a bunch of different kinds of tapas - we got a scallop, a lamp, a ham, and more, and it was so FUN! Didn't rush us at all, and although it was busy, I didn't feel like we were putting them out - and the sangria was delish. One little thing is that I drink a lot of water, so the helpers could have kept up on that a little more, for my taste. From start to finish, beautiful atmosphere, great service, and delicious food. THANKS!
