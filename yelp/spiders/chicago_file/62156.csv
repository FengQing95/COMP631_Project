Smoque BBQ////Disclaimer done,  the is a solid meal.  I order a 1/2 & 1/2 platter with brisket and sausage.  The Star was the sausage, while not a traditional chicago hot link, it is well above the grilled Eckrich sausage many of their peers serve. For a "real" hot link see Hecky's or Uncle J's (it is not fine ground). In fairness, they call it Texas Sausage and not a Hot Link.
