Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Alright it's Sat night and the place is packed (~75ppl w/20 waiting?)... we put our names down and the maitre'd tells us it's about an hour wait so come back in 45 mins. Ok no problem, we had found a Bentley to drool over anyways while walking around the neighborhood & killing time.  Came back around 40 mins later and our name isn't on the list... THAT WAS DISAPPOINTING... The same girl said we'll get the next table, but it took another 30 mins or so before we sat down.  By that time the three of us were so hungry, we could've eaten off the table next to us.
