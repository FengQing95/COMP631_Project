Smoque BBQ////After watching and hearing many great reviews of Smoque BBQ, my parents and I decided to give this place a try.  The last time I had BBQ was on my way back from Florida where we stopped at this BBQ joint in Savannah, Georgia which had just about the absolute BEST ribs I've ever had in my life.  Unfortunately I cannot say the same about Smoque BBQ.
