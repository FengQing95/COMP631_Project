The Purple Pig////We started off with the bread for the table, which surprisingly was very tasty, especially the butter they made that was infused with the perfect amount of truffle. We finished all the bread thinking that the rest of the dishes would be super tiny, so we needed to fill up on bread. But boy... that was a mistake. I would only recommend getting the bread for the table if you have 4 people or more. Being Chinese, and having eaten pig ears and pig tongue before, I was curious to see what their take on it would be like. The smoked pig tongue was the most interesting combination of flavors, but tasted so good. Did not think I was eating pig's tongue. Same thing with the crispy pig ears. Did not taste like pig ears at all. They fried it and made it so crispy that it made it nice combo with the kale and the picked banana peppers.
