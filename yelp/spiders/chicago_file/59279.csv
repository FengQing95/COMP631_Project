Smoque BBQ////One word: AMAZING! One of the best bbq places I've ever had and I am def. picky about my bbq. Got here on a Sunday night with some friends at like 5pm and the line was already out the door which shows you something about the place. When my hubby asked me what I wanted because you have to order first and then have a seat, I said "everything on the menu" because the place just smelled of pure deliciousness. We had the baby back ribs and the pulled pork as main entrees which were both melt in your mouth yummy. The sides were even more incredible, whether the cole slaw or the amazing corn bread or the mac and cheese. Oh and the best side of all was the peach cobbler, crunch on top and gooey on the bottom. Oh em gee, we will be back for sure. The only negative is that the tables are kinda on top of one another, I would suggest expanding and bring this place to the suburbs!!!
