Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is hands down one of my favorite places in Chicago. It can get pretty busy so it is nice they take reservations. Try to snag a seat outside in the first room as the natural lighting makes for a perfect afternoon/early dinner. The back is a little more crowded/but oddly romantic if you're looking for that atmosphere.
