Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was beginning to think I was crazy, but then we stopped here after a euchre game a few weeks ago, and it turns out, that again, it was definitely not as good here as at the other locations.  So I will just go to those locations and continue to finish off my Taste experience every year with a trip to the LM booth.  Still in my top three in Chicago, just won't go to the Wells location.
