Little Goat Diner////Excellent service is the name of the game at Little Goat. Came in on a Sunday morning a little before 11. Although I wasn't able to put in my name before the rest of the group arrived, I told the host that the rest of the group would be there around 11. I killed time at the connected coffee bar and watched the bakers make Little Goat's bread.
