Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I kept reading that this place is a must visit. We were seated right away but things got busy quick. Pizza takes 45 minutes which feels like forever so get an appetizer. The personal size pizza is perfect to fill you up. I have to be honest the pizza was nothing special. Maybe I just don't like deep dish? The deep dish cookie was REALLY good.
