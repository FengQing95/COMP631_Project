Little Goat Diner////This is not your typical brunch meal where it's bacon, eggs, and waffles.  Well, I mean you can be basic and get those items but YOLO. We came on New Years' Day around lunch time and was told the estimated wait was 45 mins.  Too bad they don't use the Nowait App.  I gave them my phone number & they would text us when our table is ready.  You can kill a lot of time by walking around & check out other nearby shops or walk 5ish minutes to the nearby Whole Foods OR stop into their bakery & grab a coffee!
