Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I ate here with a class during high school, and the tapas that we ordered were delicious. I especially enjoyed the Spanish tortilla. During the trip, we viewed a flamenco dancer perform which was very fun. This would be a great venue for a party. I really hope to return soon and try other things on the menu!
