Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went this wknd. Hipster theme. Food was ok, nothing special to come back to. I got the dates wrapped in bacon, spicy fries, shrimps. The sangria was however quite delicious. The reason I'm giving a one star is the terrible service. The woman who served us asked if we've done tapas before I said yes and when our shrimp order didn't come out w the rest of the food. I asked her how long it would take, bc I was curious. And the she proceeded to lecture me on what tapas were. I was trying to be nice about it since I had a guest w me. But it was really insulting. And her tone was awful. To make matters worse, if you check in for the first time at yelp you get a free desert. After our meal, I told our waitress and made sure she saw the free dessert on my app/phone, since I didn't know how it was supposed to worked. She held my phone. HELD IT! Clearly saw it. Later she told me she didn't see it, trying to infer that I was lying. I had to click back in the app to prove it to her again. What the heck? I just showed it to her. Even my guest was surprised at how awful the service was.
