Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My boyfriend took me here for a surprise birthday dinner and I was excited to try tapas for the first time. We had a reservation on a Wednesday for 6 PM and we were seated immediately. The restaurant did not full up until around 7 PM, so it turns out that we did not need reservations. I have heard that weekends are a different story entirely, but my weekday experience was that it was not crazy busy.
