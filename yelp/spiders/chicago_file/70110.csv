Little Goat Diner////Asian Shrimp Salad = Many times when you go to a new restaurant and the options are many, you are inclined to choose a non-salad item.....after all most places aren't known for their salads, right? After asking the waitress which option of two she recommended (the other was a sandwich) she pushed me toward the Asian Shrimp Salad. Boy, I'm glad she did! Not only was it amazingly tasty, but it was fresh and light, something that I needed that day.
