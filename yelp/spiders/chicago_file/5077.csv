The Purple Pig////The food is SPECTACULAR. I had the Housemade 'Nduja which was amazing. Paired perfectly with the grenache that they recommended, and portioned well. My main dish was the pork belly, and DEAR LORD. It was juicy, yet texturally sound with a crunch. The garnish of pickled carrots give it a tart sweetness to supplement the Smokey and meaty flavors. It was a hearty yet light dish, definitely the best pork belly I've ever had.
