Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ok, maybe this pizza doesn't travel well. First, I love deep dish pizza. Really I do. What I don't love is having to spend a Saturday with fellow classmates for a 7 hour long orientation. When I found out that we were having Lou Malnati's catered, I had - or so I thought - one bright point of my Saturday to look forward to.
