Little Goat Diner////I originally wanted to get the Bull's Eye French toast. But my server informed me that the egg couldn't be cooked any other way, and I didn't want the runny egg in the toast. So I chose the Fat Elvis waffle, with cheese grits and sausage. It was phenomenal. The portions were plentiful and super flavorful.
