Art Institute of Chicago////Although they didn't grant me the unpaid internship so many years ago, I don't hold a grudge against the AIC since they're a treasure to Chicago. Excellent traveling exhibits, as well as the asian/roman/egyptian items. Excellent historical renditions of society's trends, values, and tastes.
