Smoque BBQ////So we got here around 730 on a Friday and there was already a line out the door, though it did move fairly quickly I think or maybe not I'm not sure I was a little faint with hunger. Unfortunately right when we got to the front of the line we were notified that they were out of brisket... Womp womp. So instead I got the rib combo which was one rack of the baby back and one rack of the St. Louis. I got the side of fries and a side of the brisket chili and a side of slaw. The ribs overalls were pretty good though I preferred the St. Louis ribs a lot more than the baby backs. The fries were pretty solid but the chili was just kinda meh. The slaw was really good though, not mayo based which I prefer and the vinegary kick was a good contrast to the pork. Definitely coming back here again and earlier to get the brisket next time and maybe a little bit of the St. Louis ribs.
