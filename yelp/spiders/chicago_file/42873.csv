Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This was once a long standing favorite of ours but our last visit was not what we remembered. The food is mediocre and the service was a bit disappointing. The 4 stars is because I LOVE their sangria and the atmosphere is fun (the wait is not). Food and service should get three. Overall, four stars... I'm not giving up complete hope yet.
