Smoque BBQ////When our number was called, we marveled at the aluminum trays. And everything was amazing! My wife had the chicken and she actually ate the skin... Which she NEVER does. I had the brisket and it was so tender. And the ribs were not fall-off-the-bone but they were amazingly delicious. The mac 'n' cheese were as everyone says simply divine. No complaints here.
