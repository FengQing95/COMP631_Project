Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Turns out they aren't really the same thing.  Lou Malnati's deep dish has a thick, bready crust and a tangy tomato sauce.  In comparison, Zachary's has less of a bready crust, with toppings stuffed into the crust, and a pile of stewed tomatoes on top.  So yeah, they are really different and hard to directly compare.
