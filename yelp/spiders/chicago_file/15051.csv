Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Well, to be brief, my bright point wasn't very good. The sauce didn't taste fresh and the crust was soggy. Don't get me wrong, I use canned diced and stewed tomatoes in many dishes I make at home; it's just when you are going to have a sauce on a Chicago deep dish pizza, it's a pretty damned important component that should taste good whether dine-in, carry out or delivery. The thin crust was actually significantly better than the deep dish; I would give that a solid 3 stars but unfortunately cannot click 2.5.
