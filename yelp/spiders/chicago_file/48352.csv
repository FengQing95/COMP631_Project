Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////A bit pricey but otherwise excellent tapas. Between four people, we ended up ordering nine tapas and also got two free desserts thanks to Yelp. A couple of my favorite tapas were the burrata, the grilled octopus with green harissa, beef tenderloin with blue cheese, and the bacon-wrapped dates. Of course, you can't go wrong serving a hunk of burrata, and the grilled octopus was tender and had a delicious char to the outside. The beef tenderloin with blue cheese was a bit of a strange request, but ended up being delicious. The blue cheese topping was a perfect salty complement a well-cooked and tender beef tenderloin. Personally, I am a huge sucker for bacon-wrapped dates and have to order them whenever I am out for tapas. There is something so special about crispy, salty bacon wrapped around a warm, gooey, and sweet yet slightly crisp on the outside date. Perfect combination and Ba-Ba-Reeba's dates certainly did not disappoint! I found tapas like the waffles with banana and nutella and the hangar steak to just be okay. Nothing really special or super flavorful going on. For dessert, we had a mango sorbet, which was good, and a flan with nitilla, which was also good, although it was fairly runny in the center. Overall, this is definitely a classic tapas restaurant and never a bad choice. The menu is extensive and pretty much all of the dishes were ordered were tasty. The restaurant itself has a great atmosphere/vibe and drink list looked excellent so it's definitely a great place to come by and have meal with friends/family.
