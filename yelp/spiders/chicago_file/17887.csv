Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati probably learned everything he needed to know from Ike Sewell, the guy who founded Pizzeria Uno and Pizzeria Due. But he nonetheless improved upon that knowledge, and now we prefer his version of a tomato pie over all others. Now my partner and myself don't indulge often, and while I am still a fan of Pizzeria Uno's pies, it is always Lou's when we do our Pino (Noir) and Pizza night. .Their Lou's salad is fabulous, their wings, while not a value item, are respectable enough for an occasional treat. But Lou's deep dish pizza is our one true favorite. While some prefer the buttercrust (us), others need to be mindful that Lou's will cook your pizza the way you prefer: Regular, gooey, or well done. If you're not a fan of softer dough, get your pie well done. If you don't want it dry, order it gooey. Lou Malnati's aims to please, you just need to ask your server about this. After all, Chicago pizza is legendary for good reasons. Oh, and if you don't want to deal with dough, Lou's has a crust-less pizza! They use a large sausage patty as the base, and pile the sauce, cheese and other ingredients on top of that before baking it. It's great for gluten-free dieters and others who are avoiding the carb-loading that eating pizza usually involves. Nico, one of the managers at the original Lou's in Lincolnwood, IL, runs a tight ship, is very personable, and seems to have great relationships with his staff. We have had their thin crust version, and it's our recommendation that you get this style of crust half-baked, and take it home to finish the process. This guarantees a hot, freshly made pizza experience.
