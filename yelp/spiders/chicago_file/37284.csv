Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We made sure to save some room for dessert (and take home some great leftovers) and ordered the chocolate cream pie. It was the perfect choice. The pie was creamy and decadent. It was like some heavenly version of an all chocolate oreo. The service was solid but not overwhelmingly good. The atmosphere was warm and dark with some fun jazz playing. We can't wait to go back.
