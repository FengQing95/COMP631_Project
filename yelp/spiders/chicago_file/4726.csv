The Purple Pig////You go inside and order at the register and then find a table and they bring you your food. I asked for a cappuccino, and ordered the French toast with berries and pecans. Deliciousness!! My mom ordered eggs and avocado and a parfait. My cousin ordered a parfait and a latte. My aunt custom ordered eggs and veggies. Everyone loved their meals and coffee!
