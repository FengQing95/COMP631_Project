Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Oh my goodness. This place did not let me down. I ordered the Southern Eggs Benedict, my brunch mate ordered the Corned Beef Hash Skillet and we split a side of Banana Cream Pie Pancakes. The Southern Eggs Benedict was to die for. The sausage was perfectly cooked with just enough gravy to taste but not so much that it overpowered the rest of the food. Eggs were poached to perfection. The Corned Beef Hash Skillet looked fantastic and the bite that I stole was really good. The pancakes though!! Oh My!! So. Good. Crazy good. They were done perfectly and were light and fluffy. The bananas and creme were perfect on top of the pancakes. If I'm ever back in the Windy City this will be my breakfast stop.
