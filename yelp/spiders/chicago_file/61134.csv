Smoque BBQ////Originally the name of this place caught my attention. Usually crowded but that's a good sign when it comes to a BBQ joint. This is my spot now. They do a great job of finding you a seat and it doesn't take long to get your food. I have always ordered the Memphis style ribs (dry rub with no sauce) and they're perfect every time.
