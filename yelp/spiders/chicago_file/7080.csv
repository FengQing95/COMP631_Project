Art Institute of Chicago////I always find something new to be amazed at when I walk through this place.  Their special exhibits are always phenomenal.  The diversity of items on display are on par with the best art museums in the world.  Check out the medival weaponry.  The Asian art pieces are always stunning.  I love my cities art museum, I love the museums of other cities.  The art snobs who hate on it are lame, art is art no matter where you go and something special can always be taken away.  Thursday night after five is the free night, so plan accordinly.  Plus if you are a teacher for the chicago public school system you can always get into the museum for free, except for the special exhibits... thats alright though I mostly only come to stare at "Sunday Afternoon" anyway.
