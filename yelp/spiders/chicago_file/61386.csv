Smoque BBQ////Went to Smoques and ordered takeout.  Haven't been there lately and should have known when I walked in and there was no line.  Quality has dropped off considerably.  Ordered the full slab and had to throw 1/2 away.  Ribs were dry and seemed to be standing around for hours.  Won't do that again.
