Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////so i heard that bavettes was opening up and they kept describing it as an old world euro steakhouse... but what it is ... is sexiness. yeah, they have steak... they can even slather bone marrow alll over your steak. the lighting is dark, the servers are amazing and the bartenders are not only nice to look at but you wanted to be best friends with!!!
