Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Delish delectable deep dish.  You want a fantastic pie with a buttery, grainy crust, sweet and flavorful tomato sauce, a sausage patty that extends throughout the surface area of the pizza (hell yeah!), and a mozzarella that my wife described as "just ok"?  Come on down to Lou's, a yummier and less "chainy" experience than other deep dish eateries one could easily name - and certainly better than a Red Baron frozen pizza.  The service was top ten greatest of all time.  After eating my portion of the pie, my stomach only felt like I was in my first trimester - not bad.
