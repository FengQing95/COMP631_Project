Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After traveling all day, we tried Lou's at the suggestion of our cabbie. What a delight!  We were hungry for an Italian meal; we decided on spicy vodka sauce over bow tie pasta and sausage. What a great dinner!  Then we moved on to dessert!  We couldn't make up our minds on one, so we chose three on one plate. We had chocolate chip pizza with a scoop of ice cream, key lime pie AND tiramisu- oh my gosh they were all so yummy!
