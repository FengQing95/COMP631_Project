Smoque BBQ////We drove out from Schaumburg to try Smoque at noon on a Saturday.  It was worth the 30+ minute drive.  The line was shorter than expected.  The available sides were varied just enough to make my husband, my thirteen year old son and myself happy.  I had the beef brisket platter with fries and cornbread.  The bark on the brisket was absolutely delicious!  The hot, fresh fries were served in a brown paper bag with the perfect amount of seasoning.  The cornbread was still warm enough to melt the butter.  I was a bit disappointed at the temperature of the brisket though.  It was chilly in the restaurant, so my brisket got cold really quickly.  My husband had the pulled pork platter with fries and the baked mac n cheese.  Coleslaw came with the meal as well.  He is a big fan of slaw and was pleasantly surprised at their simple, yet yummy slaw.  Finally, my son had a pulled pork sandwich with baked beans and the baked mac n cheese.  I wanted to try what looked like a fresh, soft roll, but by the time I had asked for a bite, it was all gone.  He wasn't a big fan of the breadcrumbs on top of the mac n cheese, but that was a first for him.  We will definitely head back soon.  I think we need to try the chicken, ribs and peach cobbler.
