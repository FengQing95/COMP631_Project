Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I find that the deep dish here is better - the crust is really buttery and the edges are crisped to perfection. My table also ordered a bruschetta appetizer, a few pasta dishes, and dessert. I found everything to be really delicious and the portion sizes to be very generous. The pasta is made in house! For $90 we were able to try 6 dishes (including pizza) which is a great value and I had enough to take home for lunch the next day.
