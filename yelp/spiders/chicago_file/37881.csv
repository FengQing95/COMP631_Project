Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For dessert, we had the malted whiskey sundae, with hot fudge on the side. The malted whiskey ice cream tasted like a hybrid of butter scotch and caramel, unique and YUMMY. Â Our bill came at around $180, for a Saturday night out, it's on the higher bound. BUT we did both get couple of drinks (count in my husband's jameson shot) , plus my husband got steak, so personally i think it's reasonable.
