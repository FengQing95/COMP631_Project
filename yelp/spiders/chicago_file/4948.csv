The Purple Pig////We started with the bobota greek cornbread (loved the honey and cheese on top of the bread), and the 3 cheese selection (Manchego, La Retorta & Brigante). We also got a bottle of MACEDONIA, Kamara Estate, Assyrtiko from Thessaloniki, Greece which was fabulous, it was an orange wine!!
