Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've become a Cafe Ba-ba-Reeba snob.  This means that if a friend says "Let's go for tapas" and means a Tapas restaurant that is NOT Cafe Ba-ba-Reeba, I say NO.  (Maybe I'm closing myself off to other great Tapas experiences, but I don't feel like I am.)  Sangria - SO good.  Tapas - SO good.  (Recommendations: the skirt steak with shallots and herb butter sauce, chicken/chorizo sausage skewers, tomato bread, goat cheese/marina sauce with garlic bread.)  Desserts - small (yet incredible).  But you don't go to a Tapas restaurant for dessert, silly.  If you do, then it's more of an appetizer dessert.   Anyhow, fun in the summer because they have a little outdoor area.  Plenty of other bars around the area to wander off to when you're done eating their most glorious food.
