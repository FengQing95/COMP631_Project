Little Goat Diner////The bf ordered Piggy goes to China. At a glance, it looks like a gourmet egg and sausage biscuit sandwich. The flavors on the other hand made this sandwich unique. I only tasted the sauce that was poured over the sandwich. It reminded me of a sweet dumpling dipping sauce with some szechuan peppers. The bf thoroughly enjoyed his order as ab open-faced sandwich & spared only the biscuit top.
