Smoque BBQ////So what inspired my hubby and I to come here was guys review on Triple D! We love that show! We read the reviews as well and settled on the brisket and the St. Louis ribs the brisket was nothing to go crazy over but the ribs were pretty good but we didn't go crazy over them but they were up there with other great ribs we have had.. all in all nice place but we wouldn't drive an hour to go back
