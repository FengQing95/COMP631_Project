Little Goat Diner////Love this place, the menu is so unique. Last time had the Three Pigs dish, this time had the Pork Belly pancake, both great. Pork Belly pancake is basically a large salad with some porkbelly and pancake underneath. Tried a bite of the Reuban, a delicious and interesting take, but on the salty slide so would rather share that and another dish with a friend than eat a whole one on my own. My friend got the indian "burrito" which is really open faced and tastes more latin than indian, delicious and cheesy. Â Definitely would recommend making a res in advance, to be safe if you have a set time maybe make a couple weeks in advance.
