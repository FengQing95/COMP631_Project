Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Amazing deep dish pizza and very friendly bar staff (we ate at the bar to cut down on the wait time, though it didn't help all that much). The bar guys were hilarious and our banter with us especially towards the end of the evening when it emptied out a bit really added to the experience.
