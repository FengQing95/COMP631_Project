Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It was our first night in Chicago and, after a 32-hour train ride, I was in need of something spectacular. I search on "steakhouse" in the yelpiscope and several popped up immediately. I've been to Chicago before so some of them I'd already tried. I wanted a place new to me and exciting! I read the reviews and decided this was it!
