Smoque BBQ////Get ready for a loooong wait, hungry faces staring at you calculating if they will get your seat.( when we were there management were seating/clearing tables) We even met the owners(eye candy ladies!) He was so sweet to me..gave me some free stuff to take home and extra ribs for Josh because he remembered him from Diners, Drive In, and Dives.
