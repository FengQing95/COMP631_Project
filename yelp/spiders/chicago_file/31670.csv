Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came here on a Thursday afternoon around 2pm to try some Chicago pizza since I'm not from the area. Luckily the wait wasn't bad when we came, and we were seated after 5 minutes. However, their pizzas do take roughly 45 minutes to make, so even if you are seated immediately, you will still have a bit of a wait. At times when there is no immediate seating available, they let you pre-order your pizza so that you'll have less of a wait once you are seated.
