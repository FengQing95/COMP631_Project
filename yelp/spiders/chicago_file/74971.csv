Little Goat Diner////My new favorite place!! I have nothing but great things to say about this place. I didn't make it to the place I wanted to go but that was a haven sent. I loved the food and the drinks everything was good. The star of my food choices had to the chili cheese goat fries yum I am still dreaming about these fries.
