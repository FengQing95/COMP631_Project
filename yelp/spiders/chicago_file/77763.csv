Little Goat Diner////I came here once about a year ago and wasn't totally in love, so when a friend suggested coming here, I jumped at the chance to try it again. All of the goat restaurants are so popular! It had to be just me, right? Unfortunately, without even knowing, I think I ordered the same thing both times: Los Drowned. There were too many pickled veggies on top, and it was just plain hard to eat. My friend and I shared the chili cheese fries, and these were weird too. The chili had almost Indian-like spices in addition to a heck of a lot of salt. Five fries in, it was overpowering.
