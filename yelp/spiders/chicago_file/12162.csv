Art Institute of Chicago////It's a shame that I don't take advantage more often of what Chicago has to offer.  As usual it takes an out of town guest (in this case my brother from Berkley CA) to go to one of the best art museums in the world.  What more can I say because if you've been to The Art Institute of Chicago you know exactly what I'm talking about.
