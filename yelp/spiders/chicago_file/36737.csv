Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Steak Tartare - GREAT. It came out with toasted slices of bread and dijonnaisse. The steak was up top notch quality and was textured and flavored perfectly. The tartare was also cut up perfectly to where it could be spread on the provided toast. We loved this dish and it was top notch.
