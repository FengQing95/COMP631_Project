Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First let me mention that I am NOT from Chicago. But on a recent trip there I wanted to try the best authentic deep dish that the city had to offer. There were several names that repeatedly surfaced after a few minutes of research, Lou's was one of them and it happened to be the closest to my hotel.
