Little Goat Diner////We had the great pleasure of visiting here twice on a recent weekend trip to Chicago. The first time, a Sunday morning, we were told it would be about a 30 minute wait for a table in the dining room, which I was expecting and wasn't bad at all - however, we were started to get hangry, so we opted to head over to the bakery + coffee shop side of the restaurant for a quicker meal. My husband and I both ordered a bagel with schmear (rye with sweet onion for me, and apricot with smoked salmon for him), which were both wonderful. The diner serves Stumptown coffee, so even the drip coffee is a great option, which sets this place apart from most other diners. We were able to find a seat at the coffee bar and enjoyed our bagels and coffee while watching the hustle + bustle of the dining room. (Had we decided to wait for a table, I probably would have hung out in this area while we waited a grabbed a breakfast cocktail from the bar, which all sounded delicious).
