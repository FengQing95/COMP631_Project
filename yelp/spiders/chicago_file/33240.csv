Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We had a really nice dinner here. Our server was helpful and attentive when we needed him to be, but allowed us to take our time ordering and to enjoy the experience of the food. The cocktails were nicely balanced, all of the entrees were delicious, and our salad was a great start to our meal. This restaurant is lowly lit and the music accompanied our conversation perfectly. I would have to throw out a word of caution about the valet - a big group started to collect outside of the Gilt Bar, waiting for the valet guys even to be there to take our tickets. At first, I thought it was because they were retrieving cars, but that wasn't the case. Who knows where they were, but when our cars finally came, they sped up to the curb like they had just been racing.
