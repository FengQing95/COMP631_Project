Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////How did I never review this place? I went here in March for my bday and it was terrific. I had the best cooked steak I have ever had and since they knew it was my bday was treated extra nice. Very sweet. My tiramisu was great at the end and my wine was oh so great with my steak. I totally forgot what I got as an appetizer but I know I loved it. I loved it all. I already told my wife I want to come back some time this summer. This and Nicco Osteria really hit the ball out of the park with their steak and service.
