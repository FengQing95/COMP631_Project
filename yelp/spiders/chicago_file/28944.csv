Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our server was so friendly. And if I stopped right there, I'd rate this review a four star. The circulation of this restaurant is horrible. Our waters were only filled once during the beginning and once during the end. It took awhile for our server to give us our check and even longer to give it back. I watched our server take our check, serve a different table food, then another table their drinks, then finally returned with our check. The table next to us sat down before us and waited longer than us to get their check. It's busy, I get that. But for a popular restaurant, there should be more of a flow.
