The Purple Pig////Now that I have got all of that out of my system, let me tell you why The Purple Pig gets 4 stars anyway. The food at this restaurant is fantastic guys, literally everything we tried was delicious, you must try their grilled broccoli and the duck confit, both best in their class. The drinks were good but we missed the joy of having our moscow mule in a copper cup.
