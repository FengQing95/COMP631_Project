Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////On to the food... Patatas bravas is a must. Braised short ribs were fall off the bone delicious. Goat cheese is always good. The shrimp was solid. Green peppers were actually really tasty... watch out for the big red one, it's HOT (according to Jenny!) I also tried octopus for the first time... actually pretty decent. The paella was OK... nothing to rave about. I'd personally stick to the tapas.
