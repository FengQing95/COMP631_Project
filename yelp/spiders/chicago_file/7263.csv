Art Institute of Chicago////So I decided to make a complaint to the high brow wannabe bald guy at the information desk. I nicely explained of how disappointed we were that we couldn't get in after traveling all this way.  I asked him why there wasn't a sign or one of the employees announcing their food policy while people were standing in line instead of letting us get all the way to the ticket counter only to be turned down.  He informed us this was a "new policy" and that he was "sorry".  I told him that I was not there to eat - I was there to see the art!!  No sympathy from Mr. Clean.
