Little Goat Diner////The wait can get a little long if you don't have a reservation, but if you go on an off night or at a non-peak time (before 6pm, after 8:30pm) you can usually get in with around a 30 minute wait.  This of course is no problem, because the bar on the other side whips up amazing and strong cocktails that make you almost forget how hungry you are smelling all that amazing food.
