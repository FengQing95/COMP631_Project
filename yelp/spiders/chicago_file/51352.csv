Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////4. Seared sea scallops with leaks, torched oranges, and jamon serrano: Soooo yummy! This was the most expensive thing we ordered, but it was worth it! You get 4 scallops but they were perfectly balanced with that buttery scallop texture cut with the citrus from the oranges. [insert 2 thumbs up emojis]
