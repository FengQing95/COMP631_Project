Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I think it's a little overrated (opinion of a foodie from out of town). I was debating between Giordano's or Lou Malnati to try my first deep dish in Chicago and I gave in to Lou Malnati (this location) because of the reviews and ratings. It's overrated for it wasn't as good as I expected and it was certainly worse than the Giodarno's Takeout order I had in Orlando,Florida. I might be wrong about how deep dish should be like but I expected it to have light crispy crust , heavy sauce with toppings and moderate cheese. In Lou Malnati, the ratios are 1:1:1 which made me feel that it was a little too dry for a deep dish. However , their crust was on point (texture was good but a little too thick for the pizza I had). All in all , my experience in Lou Malnati would've bee better if my personal pizza had more sauce (and cheese). Oh and also, shorter wait time because I waited for 1.5hours in total.
