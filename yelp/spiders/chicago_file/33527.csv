Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Favorite date spot in the city!!!  Cozy, dark, delicious, perfect ambiance.  We have been here many times and have never been disappointed.  All the food is amazing, my favorite is the roasted chicken, by far the best chicken I have ever had.  The boyfriend says the steaks are simply outstanding, better than any other Chicago steakhouse.  We request Brandon as our server he is awesome and has perfect wine recommendations every time.  Make reservations today they book up fast!
