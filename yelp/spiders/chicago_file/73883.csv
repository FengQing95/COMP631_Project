Little Goat Diner////Service was great. Everyone was nice. The inside of the diner was super classy. but we were just dressed casual. It's a fancy diner vibe, but you don't have to dress up really. But for the most part, everyone in Chicago is usually pretty dressed up. A lot different from Minnesota. Bathrooms were good. LOVED the hand dryer.. felt like a hand massage. Overall, I liked this place, and would recommend and return here.
