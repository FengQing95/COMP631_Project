Little Goat Diner////Theres lots of hipster kitsch, like a hip decor based on the designs of someone who's 75 years old. The kitchen is one of those long things that runs down the middle so we can watch the 20 or so cooks like they're slaves while giving them no room to move at all. Did I mention how loud it is in there? They didn't think about any design just crammed 1000 seats in there with no sound barriers and no space to move between anything. It's amazing if you're one of the yuppies who loves the place and just bought a condo nearby after all that time in your Frat/Sorority. Isn't the big city exciting and different!?
