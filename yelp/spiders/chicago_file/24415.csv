Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I took a UBER in Chicago and the driver highly recommended this place. Many other people also mention this place when asked about Chicago style pizza. As expected, the place was super crowded. We were seated after 40 minutes of waiting. It was weekdays, so I guess if you visit on weekends, waiting time would be longer.
