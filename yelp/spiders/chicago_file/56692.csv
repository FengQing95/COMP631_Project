Smoque BBQ////This place is the amazing!  We arrived around 6pm just before the line started if your planning to go get there early.  I have been to a lot of BBQ places I usually am very disappointed with brisket and always nervous to order it. So at Smoque I decided to order 1/2 rack of St. Louis and a brisket taste (4oz). This was the best brisket I have ever had it literally melted in my mouth. The bark was perfect not a over powering rub it was about the beef! They did put sauce on the serving but just a touch, it didn't need it but at the same time I was happy it was there it just add another layer of OMG! It was super juicy with just the right amount of smoke and moist moist moist!  I also got a 1/2 rack of St. Louis style which like the brisket had a great bark, smoke and perfect rub. The meat was moist without sauce and the flavor very much about the pork!  Now to the sides most places I have been to the sides are just sides and seem to get less attention. We got Baked beans, corn bread, cole slaw, brisket chili, Mac and cheese and fries.  The baked beans were the star of the sides absolutely amazing with a great smokey flavor! All the other sides were great as well fresh and flavorful. If your in Chicago make sure you don't miss out on this gem of a BBQ place.  Can't wait to go back some day!
