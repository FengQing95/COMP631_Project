Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Anyways, we came on a Sunday night and was quoted 45-60 min wait.  Doable.  We put down our names and preordered our pizza.  We ordered the Lou and added italian sausage.  The wait wasn't too bad, we managed to find seats inside.  Fast forward, we were seated and ordered a salad and couple drinks.  I was so shocked at how long it took the salad to come out... and even shocked at how long the PIZZA took to come out.  What was the point of preordering?!  It felt like it still took a good hour for it come out...
