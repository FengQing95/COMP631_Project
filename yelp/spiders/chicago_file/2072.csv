Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The wait was about 45 min on a Friday morning. The staff was friendly, attentive and polite. This place is very popular and noisy, though largely sounds of laughter and joy. This place is very family friendly and attracts tourists visiting nearby Millennium park and the art institute. I had the Florence Benedict with fruit, and it was aight. I should have ordered the pancakes.
