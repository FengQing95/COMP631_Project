Art Institute of Chicago////Cool note, scattered throughout the museum are artists who've setup their easels and are recreating some of the master pieces. I'm assuming the majority of these people are students but it was neat to watch them work. There are also lots of benches and seats spread through out to rest for a few minutes as one could walk the halls for hours.
