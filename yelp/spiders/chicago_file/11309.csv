Art Institute of Chicago////The Bedroom Series are three different paintings of Van Gogh's bedroom while he lived in his Yellow House. The Museum did an excellent job of displaying Van Gogh's work with a detailed time line of his life accompanied with rationales Â for each painting. The museum itself was awe inspiring and I will definitely return!
