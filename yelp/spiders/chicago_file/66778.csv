Little Goat Diner////I was wary of the hype, but this place was amazing. Went solo on a business trip and had a goat burger, pea tendrils, and took a turtle pie to go. Everything was amazing. The burger was delicious and cooked perfectly, and the pea tendrils, which I was told are cooked in Stephanie's saute sauce that they also sell in bottles, were amazing though a little oniony for my taste. The turtle pie was a decadent entire small pie with the best cookie crust I've ever had, and smothered in delicious caramel and cashews. (Definitely sharing size.) Amazing, and can't wait to go back. Made an opentable res Â but there was no wait for one or two people to sit at the counter on a Sun night.
