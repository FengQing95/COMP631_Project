Smoque BBQ////So I went here with a bunch of friends, thinking that this would be some amazing bbq after all of the hype on Yelp. Was thinking that the bbq would be comparable to the mouth-savoring juicy brisket that just melted in your mouth with its tangy sauce. But sadly, it was just, okay. It was nice. No doubt about that. It got the appropriate messiness that came with eating bbq, where your hands smelled of the smoky aroma a day after you ate it. And you got that feeling in your tummy of the mass amount of beef that you just threw into your belly to be slowly digested and rendered into some scrumptious fat by the amazing body that you have. Yet, the fries in all honestly were the highlight. The fries were a cross between in-n-out and Five Guys fries. They had that fresh crispiness of an in-n-out fry but a little larger towards the steak fry persona. Texas links were good, but not memorable. I just remember them being alright.
