Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We haven't been here in a year, but a member of our party couldn't wait to visit. The dining was excellent. We arrived at 5pm. We were seated immediately. The server was attentive. Keep in mind that the pizza's are made fresh, so prepare yourself for a bit of a wait for it to finish. The end result is excellent. The Chicago Classic is my favorite and just wonderful. The bill was reasonable. Highly recommend you visit. It's a must visit while in town.
