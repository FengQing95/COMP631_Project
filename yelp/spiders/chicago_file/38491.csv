Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We started off our meal with the goat cheese appetizer. Nothing to write home about, but good and what we expected. The sour dough bread with butter was fresh and hot. Very good. For our main course, I had the bone in filet, cooked medium rare. It was perfection. Highly recommend this for all the steak lovers our there. I also ordered a side of bone marrow with my steak, which was like butter. I did have to ask for some bread as it's too rich for my taste to eat on its own. My husband had the dry aged rib-eye, which was also very tasty and HUGE (enough for leftovers), BUT the bone in filet is where it's at. The seasoning on both were minimal as it is not needed. They give you seasoning and a butter concoction on the side, but they are incredibly tasty without. For the sides, we ordered the corn and brussels. Both were extremely tasty.
