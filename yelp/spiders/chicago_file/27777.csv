Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I liked the pizza here, esp w/ the buttery crust. The particular location is very neat to explore and is much bigger than you would expect from outside. The wait wasn't too long and is well organized. Staff was great. Im sure you can find better pizza elsewhere but it would never end with a Â search. If you have a better place hey send me a message and let me know! Everyone comes here for the deep dish, and personally, I think it doesn't disappoint. I think its a good place to try and I would definitely come back for another round. Just a little turned off by the price which drops a star but otherwise a great pizza joint IMO.
