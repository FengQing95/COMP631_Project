Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've had the pleasure of eating Lou's on more than a few occasions. I've sampled the calamari, fries, salads, and a couple of the deep dish pizzas. Let me tell you, just order "the Lou" and you will be happy. It is the best deep dish pizza I've had and the flavors are pure succulence. There are some fun little cheeses, spinach, tomato, as well as a garlic butter crust which combine beautifully to the delight of my tastebuds. When I'm feeling extra hongry I add sausage. I've never had anything bad from there. It's a great casual Chicago spot and in my opinion they have the best deep dish. Definitely recommend trying it once.
