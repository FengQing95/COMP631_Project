Smoque BBQ////Anytime you see a line out the door for food - eat there. People don't want to wait for ANYTHING, but most humans are intelligent enough to understand the concept of a worthy sacrifice. Fortunately the line wasn't out the door like I have seen, but there was enough of a line for people behind and in front of us to complain incessantly. The staff is prepared for the long lines, so if you can't deal with waiting and sitting next to strangers, do us all a favor and eat somewhere else.
