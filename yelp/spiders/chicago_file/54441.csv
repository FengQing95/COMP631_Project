Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The goat cheese and pasta bravas were delicious. The scallops were fishy, not what I'd call the best. The chicken empanadas were flaky and mediocre tasting. The pruno wine description sounds ridiculously made up - it tastes like most other wines. The paella was okay. The red and white sangrias were really good. However, the service is five stars from all their staff!!
