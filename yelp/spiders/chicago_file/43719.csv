Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////After having been to Mercat a la planxa and avec, I wasn't impressed with Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba.  We ordered the fried calamari and bacon wrapped dates.  Both dishes were drenched in oil which left me cringing.  The sangria seemed too watery as well.  Moreover, the atmosphere of the place is rather dark and dull. If you want a date that doesn't impose much burden on your wallet, then this may be your spot.  On a personal level, I would much rather visit Mercat for a true tapas experience.  HOWEVER, if I were to give one praise, then it'd be the restrooms.  They are clean and well managed!
