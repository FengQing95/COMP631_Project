Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The service is definitely great as well. After I ordered the cognac sazerac, the waiter sweetly warned me that many ladies tend to dislike how strong the liquor is in the drink. My husband and I shared a giggle because this particular lady would never produce such a weak-sauced complaint, especially when we're talking quality stuff. It was a really great cocktail and I thought everything was balanced and finished nicely. So ladies, unless you only drink cosmos and amaretto sours, go for it - though it may be the only drink you need for the rest of the night.
