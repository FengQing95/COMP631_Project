Little Goat Diner////Very good, specially for being diner themed. Just don't go here expecting Girl and The Goat type of food or quality. I went on a saturday night around 7:30pm and the wait was only 10 minutes. It's nice to have somewhere in the area that is easy to get in on a saturday night. After reading other yelp reviews I tried the pork belly pancake. It was very good. I loved the slaw on top. Their drinks are also very good. The only reason I didn't give this place a 5 star is because of the service. The waitress was very good but the whole experience was very slow. It took forever to receive our drinks and food. When you visit, plan on spending a little bit of time here.
