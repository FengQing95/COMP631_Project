Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////What I liked...they take reservations, which is bomb because we came here for a birthday occasion and were seated straight away. I did enjoy their sangria. Granted, I still think I make the world's best sangria, but I was liking what we ordered. We started with their sangria of the day, which was a mango sangria, with white wine. Then we opted for the more traditional red wine sangria. If I had to choose between the two, I would say the mango sangria was more my style, but I've never been a red wine kind a gal, so maybe this is why.
