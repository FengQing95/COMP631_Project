Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For the best deep dish pizza, Lou's was my favorite when I was in Chicago. I made finding the ultimate chicago style pizza a personal quest so trust me, I tried a lot of pizza places. And by far my favorite is the sausage! It's like a whole sausage patty on top. Seriously, good stuff.
