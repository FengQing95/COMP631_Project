Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The best deep dish pizza I've ever had. And that butter crust is so good it makes you wanna slap someone. Before arriving to Chitown for my 30th birthday this past December, I  had looked up Lou's on line and vowed that we'd go to check it out. It was only a few blocks away from or Hotel (Almafi) so we decided to walk and check it out -  Boy were we impressed. the freshest bruschetta I had ever had - with Delicious tomatoes, freshly shaved parm, and good olive oil. The pizza was so good I will definitely order some to go and take it home to Cali! Go and you will see what's up. Wish there was one in California
