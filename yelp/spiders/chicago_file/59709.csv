Smoque BBQ////The flavor of the ribs could stand on its own, even without sauce. The texture isn't chewy and falls off the bone with one meek chomp. And now, the sauce... married with the ribs, it's pure perfection. The sauce has just the right amount of spice and the right amount of tang. It would be a sin to let a drop go to waste, and honestly it could probably stand on it's own in a glass with a silly straw.
