Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We ordered some appetizers, the dry aged ribeye, and also the braised veal cheeks. The braised veal cheeks were OK to good, but nothing in comparison to taste that the dry aged steak puts out.  It's absolutely amazing.  Easily the best steak I've had in many years.  I believe the SO agreed, which makes it a success.
