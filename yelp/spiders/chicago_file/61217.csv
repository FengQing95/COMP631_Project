Smoque BBQ////Spent a weekend in Chicago and chose Smoque over the competition. No regrets! The ribs were great and the sides were just as good. Some of the best coleslaw around. Everyone at my table raved about the mac & cheese and I wish I would have tried the brisket, it looked delicious. Next time I am in Chicago I will make another stop here, no need to look any further.
