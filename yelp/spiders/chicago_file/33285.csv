Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's Double Cut Lambchop is soooo good. The peppery jus is coated on every bite of it. I'm enjoying the half of the lambchop I didn't finish last night this morning. Incredibly, the fois gras-like meatiness and texture is still perfect. Thanks for the great dinner, Bavette's. I will definitely be back for your steaks.
