Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I absolutely love this place...hard to walk in to get a table, so you need a reservation. But the wait is worth it when you can order pitchers of sangria at the bar! My favorite sangria is the red...the fruity flavors tend to get really sweet - what's the point if you can't taste the wine?
