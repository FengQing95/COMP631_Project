Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I'm from California and I've traveled the world.  I always look for the best places to dine and Bavette's is hands down my favorite place to dine in the US.  Good thing my son goes to school in Chicago because it gives me a reason to visit.  When I'm in town, I make sure to make reservations at Bavette's.  (You need to call WAY in advance for reservations)  Here's a tip: Order the shrimp appetizer.  Dunk the bread, that comes with it, into the sauce.  Close your eyes and take a bite.  It is heaven!  I love the smoked Trout Caesar Salad too.  Everything is divine and the ambiance is very cool.  It reminds me of being in Paris but with much better service. Voila!
