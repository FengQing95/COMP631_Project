Art Institute of Chicago////My favorite exhibit, for whatever reason, has always been the paperweights. Sounds ridiculous, but check them out. I guarantee you'll want a few for your desk. Otherwise, I am a huge fan of the Asian, Indian and African art which dates back far in to the BCE period. Generally, "normal" art (paintings from Europe and the US) bore me a bit, but they do a great job here of having interesting, excellent works of art.
