Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My first order of business when landing in Chicago was to eat a Deep Dish Pizza. Â I was given the tough decision of choosing which place to try a deep dish in a city where everything is the "Best Deep Dish in Chicago!" and decided on Lou Malnati's based off of the overwhelming amount of positive reviews.
