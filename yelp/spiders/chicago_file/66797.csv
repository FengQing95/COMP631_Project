Little Goat Diner////service was slightly slow and spotty, but it was opening day. we got a reuben that was good but a bit watery/drippy, mashed potatoes w/ beef gravy which were awesome, and some mac and cheese which was a tad bland. for dessert we got fried fluffernutter which is actually a PB&J deconstruction thing. pretty good if you're ok with slightly heavy desserts. they comped us dessert due to the spotty service (which was actually ok, compared to some other experiences) so that was nice. everything is a la carte, so the sandwich didn't come with fries or anything. all told it'd probably be $20 for a sammich and fries. kinda on the high end.
