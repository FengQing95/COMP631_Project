Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I stopped in last night (5/9). A good 15 minute walk from Michigan Ave. I found an open seat at the bar and was quickly acknowledged with a welcome and a menu. A small deep dish with sausage and cheese caught my eye. A half hour later but worth the wait. A bite into the slice was the crunch. It was delicious. You have two screens at the bar where I watched half of the Rockets vs. Jazz game. I would come again. It was also highly recommended by other visitors in the City. Thank you.
