Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////i completely agree with the comment that lou malnatti's is mediocre (at best). i don't really like deepdish but i my cousin (from new haven, home of the Best Pizza Ever) was visiting and demanded to be taken to lou's because she heard it was the best pizza in chicago. neither of us were impressed, and i think i was even less so than her.
