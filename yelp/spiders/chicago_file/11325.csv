Art Institute of Chicago////Expansive; you could easily spend weeks roaming the exhibits! I personally enjoyed the European art and paintings/sculptures from Medieval/Renaissance period. I would definitely recommend to Chicago natives and tourists alike. Staff was quite friendly and knowledgeable about the museum facilities. Directed to desired exhibits without an issue.
