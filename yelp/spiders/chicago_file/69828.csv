Little Goat Diner////Kimchi in the pancake was too salty for me.  I removed the kimchi and ate the rest.  If they add all the ingredients in the pancake and add some flour to make it look like regular pancake I probably like it better. My husband loved his hamburger.  It was cooked just the way he wanted.  Maple sausage and  Brussels sprouts were great.   Excellent service.
