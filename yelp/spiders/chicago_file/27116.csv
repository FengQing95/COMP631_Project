Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The usual order consists of: Malnati Chicago classic, Malnati's salad, and calamari. What makes Lou's deep dish better than others is it's not overly stuffed. The sausage is lean and not overly salty as it carelessly rests on a bed of vine-ripened tomatoes. One can easily down two slices without feeling too guilty unless you also ordered appetizers. The calamari was standard, lightly breaded, and seasoned. It delight to have but I would not say it's a must-order. As for the salad, I could care less. Honestly, when I go for deep dish, I'm not looking for a healthy meal. I mainly ordered it so as to not further provoke my out-of-country friends into thinking what unhealthy and detrimental eating habits Americans have.
