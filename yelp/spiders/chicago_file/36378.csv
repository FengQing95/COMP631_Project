Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Dominic P. had the classic ribeye, which was the best steak I've ever eaten.  It was a massive steak, I had a few bites, and he ended up taking a chunk home.  The Bearnaise sauce is the most creamy, butter, artery-clogging goodness ever.  You better believe I stole some of it for my own steak.  His steak was cooked medium-rare, which isn't my preference, but it was still out of this world!
