Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The hams hanging from the ceiling reminded me of my vivacious trip to Espana in 1995. Every single bar I went to there had jamons hanging from the ceilings. The difference here at BaBaRe, was there was no cigaret smoke curing the hams, as there was in Sevilla. Did they taste the same - I'll have to go back for that. They were the same variety, though, with (ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS STOP READING NOW) the hoof still attached, and a little cone shaped drip cup stuck in to catch drips of savory ham juice.
