Little Goat Diner////Not bad, but disappointing. I love Girl & the Goat because while it's not an every day dining experience, I think the value of what you get is definitely worth the cost. Little Goat is overpriced, small portioned, and the food is just good. Nothing great, nothing terrible, just good. I'd rather spend $10 for corned beef hash at my local diner than $16 and then $3.50 for coffee at Little Goat. It's just really not very special.
