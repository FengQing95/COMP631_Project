Smoque BBQ////Super delish! I ordered baby back ribs, chopped brisket sandwich, mac'n cheese, baked beans, cornbread & French fries. Ribs very filling & quite the quality, very YuMMi. Brisket sandwich was very good, but a little fatty. mac'n cheese & baked beans are to die for & cornbread so delish with corn inside. I love this place & always try to swing by when in the area, even the coleslaw is delish!! Only downfall is they are super busy(which is great)aNd if you are looking for a quick meal, that probably won't happen here. The have time groups eVen for pick up. I never, Â in my experiences though, have waited longer than a 1/2 hour.
