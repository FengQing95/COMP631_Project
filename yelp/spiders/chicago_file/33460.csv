Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The other reviews don't even do this place justice! Miraculously, we got a reservation (after checking the day before and none were available). I picked the place to celebrate my birthday, and wow was it a great decisions! First, the ambience is amazing - dark wood, low lights, exposed brick and 1950's feel. Secondly, great, prompt service. Our waitress was friendly and answered our questions patiently (including what a "goldbrick sundae" was - it's an ice cream sundae with a chocolate shell and pecans). Third, the FOOD. The bread they have is amazing (I would have gone for the bread alone) - thick, soft on the inside, crunchy on the outside. For dinner we had the stroganoff (me), steak frites (brother in law) and the ribeye (my sister). We got the broccoli, corn and creamed spinach. Our ratings were: stroganoff A; ribeye A+; steak frites A+; corn A+; creamed spinach A; broccoli B. Definitely recommend!!
