Little Goat Diner////The menu was incredibly creative and we were seated relatively quickly without a reservation. However, all members of my party were a little disappointed with what we got. While GOOD, it was missing the little "something-something" that the menu implied. We may have just all gotten the wrong thing, but it was a little bit of a let down (especially considering the cost!)
