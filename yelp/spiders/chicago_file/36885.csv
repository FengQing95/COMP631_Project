Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Restaurant was too loud. They make no effort at crowd control. The man next to us yelled the whole night across his table to the person he was with. No waiter made an effort to tell him that the whole restaurant could hear him. The food was good but it is not a good place for a date night.
