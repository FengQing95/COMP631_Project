Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Always have great service and food!!  I mostly take out since I live close by and the ladies who handle the take out run that ship tight!!  I love how organized they are and how efficient.  I do have a wait sometimes beyond the time given to me when I order but it's to be expected on a busy night. I actually don't like thick crust but I love their think crust, the Lou!  And the salads are good, too ;)  Neighborhood favorite!!
