Art Institute of Chicago////The museum's staff were very courteous, and were quick to help give directions or comment on their favorite pieces when asked. I appreciated their ability to "chaperone" the collection without being intrusive or belligerent - for those who frequent fine art museums often, you certainly know what I mean. I really hate it when the docents act as if patrons wish to deface the art - most of us aren't psycho!
