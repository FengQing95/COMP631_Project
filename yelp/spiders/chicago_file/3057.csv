The Purple Pig////I walk by this place almost every day and it never occurred to me to Â check it out. My friends from Reno,NV was raving about how this was a must try on their list. I was fortunate enough to have joined them on a spur of the moment happy hour ( we missed our Chicago Architectural Tour). We popped in on a Monday afternoon around 4 PM and was promptly welcomed by the hostess. We were seated outside by the river to really enjoy and appreciate the beauty of Chicago summer. Service was fast, friendly, and love it when they mind snapping a few photos for you.
