The Purple Pig////We ended up going with creating our own charcuterie plate. We opted for a smoked goat cheese, a sharp cheddar, and then we let the waiter pick our third. We got two meats that included duck prosciutto & air cured beef. It came with a few accompaniments like olives, and spreads. We both loved it and it was the perfect portion for the two of us to share. I think we could have sat here and ate all night trying everything on the menu but we had plans that we had to get to.
