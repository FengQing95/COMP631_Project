Art Institute of Chicago////The Met, MoMa and Guggenheim are my favorite museums. Now, I must add Art Institute of Chicago to my list. (To me.... It's better than The Louvre in Paris.) AIC has an excellent collection of various artists and mixed media. Before it's gone, the one thing I highly recommend is to see the Magritte Exhibit "Magritte: The Mystery of the Ordinary, 1926-1938".
