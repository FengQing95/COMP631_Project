The Purple Pig////If you are looking for a trendy, fun place, with great ambiance, this is the spot for you. The food was very good. I thoroughly enjoyed the cheese plate and the ricotta gnocchi was delicious. I hope you enjoyed this review, amongst the 6,000 other, probably better written reviews. Thank you.
