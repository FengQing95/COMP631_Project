Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The best steakhouse in Chicago without a doubt. It is actually the best steakhouse I have been too period. I have been to all of the top steak joints in Chicago including Chicago Cut, Primehouse, Prime & Provisions, Gibsons, Mastros, Del Frisco's...the list goes on. Bavette's is a step above. Not saying any of the aforementioned were bad by any means. They are all great as well, but this place does everything right. The ambiance is superb, the portions are how they should be, the food is unequivocally the best from start to finish. The wedge salad to start is absolutely awesome. Huge, so be prepared to share or keep to yourself ;) The bleu cheese dressing used is amazing, not too mention the bacon as well. The steak here is mouthwatering. Some of the best cuts I have seen. The steak salt served on the side is a nice touch. DELICIOUS. The sides to accompany the steaks are excellent as well. The show stealer is the chocolate pie for dessert though. If you save room, this is a must have. I would come here for the pie and drinks alone.
