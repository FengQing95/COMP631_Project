Art Institute of Chicago////BEST DATE PLACE! I recently started talking to this girl who was madly in love with art. A few of my friends suggested I take here to the Art Institute. Art isn't my thing, but I figured she was worth it. I did some research on the place before taking her there, this place has days that are FREE to the public! Gotta love FREE! We got there and there were so many exhibits I actually enjoyed. This place has art for anyone who like any kind of art. It wasn't boring or specific it was pretty cool. It impressed me with what they all had there! I will be coming back more often. I told all my gym friends about it!
