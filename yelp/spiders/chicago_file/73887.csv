Little Goat Diner////On a warm summer day, I underwent a 2-mile walk from my hotel, dragging my suitcase behind me, in order to visit Little Goat (too cheap to hail a cab).  I had been saving Little Goat for my last stop during a mini-Chicago vacation, looking forward to the visit all week.  I arrived around 10 AM on a weekday, and was easily able to get a seat at the bar top. My server was very kind about my bulky suitcase, and gently moved it against a wall.
