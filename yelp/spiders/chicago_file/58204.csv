Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Let me start off by saying I am not Spanish but I DID study abroad in Barcelona for a semester so that makes me *super duper credible* hahaha jk. My great grandfather is Spanish though, but that also doesn't mean much, I never even met the guy... Anyway, I love this place! I actually may become a Sunday regular because of all their options, seasonal items, and it's proximity to my church. I love tapas style dining- sharing good food with others is one of my favorite things in the world. Okay, so the service here was pretty normal and positive. Nothing extraordinary but definitely had a kind server. Our order was messed up and we weren't going to say anything but he actually noticed, apologized, and brought it up himself which we were so impressed by!
