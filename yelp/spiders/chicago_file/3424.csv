The Purple Pig////The Purple Pig, was one of the spots I had to visit during my trip to Chicago. The first plate to come with the ribeye. This was okay, the meat was good, not sure about all the other stuff. The next to arrive was the bone marrow, this was really good. I like the idea you could add salt to taste on the side when you mix it all together on toast. BOMB. After that was the pork shoulder, tender, soft, delicious, must get, on a bed of mash potatoes that were also very good. Then the desert, nothing special, meh.
