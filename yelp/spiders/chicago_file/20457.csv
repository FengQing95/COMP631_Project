Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////A true, Chicago-style pizza is a must in the Windy City. While Lou Malnati's Pizzeria delivers the goods, I must admit that I've had better pizza. The pizza is nice and thick, but I would describe it as merely "good" and not "great". If you are looking to get stuffed full of food, a mere two slices will do the trick, although I feel the sauce and sausage could have a bit more flavor.
