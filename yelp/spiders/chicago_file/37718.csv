Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The hostess told us that it'll be 45-60 minute wait, which I expected. They suggested we wait at the bar or go to Gilt Bar and they would give us a call. The bar was full so we opted for Gilt Bar (which was pretty amazing). All and All our wait ended up being 90 minutes for 2 so word for the wise don't come here starving!
