Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Came Friday morning with D'wife after reading very good reviews about this place. We were not disappointed even though we had to wait 45 minutes on a windy and cold morning. While waiting we enjoyed a well needed cup of intelligentsia  coffee. Ordered the butchers block skillet which is a large portion of hash browns and cheddar cheese with turkey and chicken sausages, ham, bacon, more sausage and a pair of your choice of eggs. I substituted pancakes for cottage cheese. The bossy lady(wife) had the garden skillet which is a large portion of hash browns, cheddar cheese, mushrooms, asparagus, spinach,onions,tomatoes, broccoli and she ordered poached eggs, the order came with pancakes..she exclaimed "Delicious", and did not talk anymore. The service was ok, for a busy morning. Our waiter forgot to take our drinks order, when I reminded him that we needed coffee, he replied "well, I was going to but, you interrupted me with your food order", a RUDE  reply, but I didn't let that ruin our breakfast experience, I know the place was busy. Overall busy, but delicious great place for breakfast. Will definitively come back
