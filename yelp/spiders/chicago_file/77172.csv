Little Goat Diner////I was in Chicago for a friend's wedding and was able to carve out some time to explore one of my favorite cities in America. I've been a fan of Stephanie Izard ever since she appeared on Season 4 of Top Chef in 2008 where she went on to win it all. During this trip, I was determined to eat at either Girl and the Goat or Little Goat, which were conveniently right across the street from each other. My friends and I couldn't get a table at Girl and the Goat so we opted for Little Goat. This cool, laid-back diner was buzzing with the sounds like a classic 50's diner. (I'm only imagining since I wasn't born in the 50's.) The menu was an interesting fusion of diner food with lots of Asian influences like Kimchee Bacon & Eggs, Parathas Burrito, Chinese Chicken Sandwich and a Bahn Mi Style Burger.
