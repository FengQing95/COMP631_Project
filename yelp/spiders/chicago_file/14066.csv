Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My friend was on her way out of town this past Monday and couldn't leave without having some deep-dish.  I'm a huge fan of Lou Malnati's and normally just get take out from their Wicker Park location.  We hit up the Bean, and the closest Lou Malnati's was in River North, so we headed up a few blocks.  At one o'clock on a Monday, you can breeze right in without any sort of wait.  We sat down and ordered right away--a Lou, one half sans mushrooms and a house salad.  We were told the pizza would take about 35-40 minutes, which is pretty standard.  Our salad came out immediately, and even though we didn't ask, our server split it on two plates, which I thought was great.  Thirty-five, forty, fifty minutes pass, and still no pizza in sight.  The table next to us ordered after us and received their pizza, which was also a Lou.  About ten minutes later, the manager comes over to tell us our pizza order had some problems. She said it was made wrong with mushrooms on the whole thing.  My friend and I were starving at this point, so we said just bring it on out.  The manager comped the whole pizza due to mix up.  While it sucks to have to wait extra long, and I'm pretty sure that other table had our pizza, they definitely made up for it by not charging us for the pizza.  And, boy, was that pizza delicious!
