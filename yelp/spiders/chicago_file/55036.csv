Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The spicy potatoes were good -- 5/5. The smoked salmon was a bit of a let down, not the best but not the worst -- 3.5/5. The shrimp was mediocre and not very flavorful for me, but it's ceviche style so others may enjoy it -- 3/5. The scallops tasted pretty good -- 4/5. The grilled hanger steak tasted good too, but then got really hard to chew -- 4/5. Finally, the chicken empanada was pretty good but you literally get 1 for $6.50-- 5/5 for taste though.
