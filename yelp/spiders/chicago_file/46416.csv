Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I wasn't super disappointed in this place, but I wasn't really thrilled either. Some of the small plates just seem kinda overpriced. The grilled hanger steak plate honestly tasted a bit strange. The chef's artisanal cheese selection came with bread that was really hard and chewy. Overall, not really impressive. But, the manchego stuffed mushrooms were a winner for me. They were absolutely delicious. the buttermilk fried chicken was pretty good as well. I would be willing to come back, I just wish the quality was a bit better for the price you pay.
