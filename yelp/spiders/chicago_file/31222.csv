Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It was our first time here and our first true Chicago Deep Dish Pizza. Let's just say that Lou's did not disappoint.  We ordered the small classic pizza and a bowl of minestrone soup. Wow.  Great flavors. It's kind of a joke but expect a nice buttery crust with a hint of cornmeal, the restaurant's own proprietary recipe Italian sausage, industrial-strength cheese all topped with a bright and chunky tomato sauce that tastes like tomatoes off a vine. Mmmm.   The souped was rich and tasty.  My recommendations are whatever size pizza you think you need, buy the smaller one!  (It is really filling.). The second is take an UBER as the parking sucks.
