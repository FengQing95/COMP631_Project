Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered the deep dish pizza and fried calamari to share between my husband and I. The pizza honestly wasn't that great. It was quite dry and hard to chew, but the calamari was superb. I was quite disappointed at their deep dish pizza, would not order that again in the future. Maybe I will come back and try their other dishes next time.
