Smoque BBQ////The Good: On the other hand, I LOVE the lightly vinegared *Slaw. Lower the calories and add some zing! It has always been fresh too. As far as meat goes, I'm in love with the *Beef Brisket. I eat anything fatty and succulent and this perfect cut delivers. It is always tender and spiced well enough to eat alone. I get the sauce on the side. I think the pulled pork is pretty good too. Once, they had *Burnt Ends as a special, which essentially is the fatty end of the brisket cooked and sauced a bit differently. I loved it, but alas it isn't a regular item due to supplier constraints.
