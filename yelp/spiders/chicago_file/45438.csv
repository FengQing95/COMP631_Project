Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I get a little anxious sharing food tapas style but this food was delicious! Almost worth the stress of having to share all of your food and then split your bill with a million people. Almost. Just kidding, it's not worth it at all. But if you must because you're insane and hate simplicity, the short ribs and goat cheese dip are good. Lots of wine choices too. They also have gluten free bread, for your token friend who fakes a gluten allergy to justify eating mostly lettuce. I'll probably never go back, because I can go literally anywhere else and keep all my food to myself, but to each their own.
