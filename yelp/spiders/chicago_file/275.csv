Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Pretty big place, doesn't have a city feel to it at all-Got seated right away and were given the menus with lots of options-I wanted French Toast, but I had no idea it had cinnamon on it, I do not like cinnamon on anything so I was bummed about that-Was it bad, no...but it should state that on the menu if it contains cinnamon-
