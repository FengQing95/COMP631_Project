Smoque BBQ////Not much to add that has not been written.  So, I find it sufficient to present my agreement with every positive review on yelp and to reiterate that Smoque is absolutely the best BBQ in the City.  A word or two about the ribs:  I only thought those at Twin Achors (which are just as expensive) were good until I tried Smoque.  No comparison.
