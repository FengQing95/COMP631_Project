Little Goat Diner////If your eating in the west loop and you don't at least try to get a seat at little goat, you are crazy. I have never waited less than 20 min for a seat, but this place is incredible. The back bar / coffee shop is first come first serve and can be a great place to get a coffee or snack as your wait.
