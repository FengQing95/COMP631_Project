Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My group downed several pitchers of their sangria (red and peach) throughout dinner. Both were good! We ordered a ton of food. Pardon my ignorance on the names because I was not in charge of ordering. We had burrata with green sauce and corn, cheesy bread with a red sauce, huge potatoes with an orange sauce, sausage plates, beef short rib and two plates of the pork paella. Everything was outstanding! Each tapa is good to share among 3-4 people (assuming you're going to order multiple) and the paellas are huge servings. I literally couldn't get enough of just about every dish. They will also bring you as much free bread as you can possibly eat.
