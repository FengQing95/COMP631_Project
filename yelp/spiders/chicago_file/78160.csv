Little Goat Diner////Wow wow wow. Excellent brunch. The pancakes are delicious. It's definitely not a "traditional" brunch, but soooo delicious. Flavors remind of Asian cuisine. We ordered the "little pig went to China", "okonomiyaki", and the veggie omelette for savory. And then we complemented with he blueberry and chocolate pancakes. My favorite was the okonomiyaki and the blueberry pancakes but everything was delicious.
