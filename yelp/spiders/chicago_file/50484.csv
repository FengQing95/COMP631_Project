Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The vibe is different. It's not just because I'm old and there's progress, it's now, well, kind of blah & mainstream. The service remains top notch--fast refills, friendly, on it. Â It's a well oiled machine that just works, but why were the kids given hummus & carrots? I'd expect chickpeas, but hummus? They loved the bread and oil, but hummus? In Madrid & Barcelona they weren't served hummus. I also question why the bacon wrapped dates were deliberately made soggy with the citrus vinaigrette--just put them on a plate. Stab an apple with the toothpick, if you like, but never, EVER make bacon soggy. That's just not fair to the pig.
