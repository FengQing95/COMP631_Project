Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We were seated immediately in the bar on a weeknight. The service was slow and the bartender wasn't busy, but there were 2 drunk girls who looked like they may have loose morals making a scene of themselves. We got a pitcher of white sangria, which was ALL ice. All we did was look at it funny and the bartender goes "it's 7 glasses. If it's not I buy it, if it is, you pay double." Ok dude, chill. You're right, it's 7 glasses full of ice and juice.
