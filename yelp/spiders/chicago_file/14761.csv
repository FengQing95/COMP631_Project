Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Now I don't have any knowledge of deep dish pizza and the only kind I had was BJ's Brewhouse's style.  I remembered it being very doughy and just too much bread. Yuck!  But here . . . oh man. . . . was I blown away!! First off, it takes 45min or so for these pizza to come out and it's worth the wait!! So while you wait, you can drink and eat appetizers or salads, but you really don't want to do that cause you'll fill yourself up quick.  When the pizza came out, the crust and the bottom portion were nice and crunchy on the outside, but nice and not too doughy in the middle! The topping was phenomenal on these pies and my image of deep dish thought it was going to be heavily sauced, but at Lou's, it had the right amount of sauce on it!! I think my brother and I did not finish our first slice cause we were just in complete awe and just mesmerized by the texture and the taste of these deep dish!  We were both satisfied and felt content leaving this place!
