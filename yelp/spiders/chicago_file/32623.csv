Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////An amazingly beautiful restaurant...downstairs is dark and intimate...a fine menu with an attentive and courteous staff...great cocktails,delicious oysters,warm bread...the stroganoff is fantastic but the steak is the reason for the 5 stars....had steaks at most of the greats in nyc and chicago and the 10oz filet stands the test with most..the creamed spinach is fantastic...highly highly recommended!
