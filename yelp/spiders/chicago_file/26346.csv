Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pizza was delicious but service was just okay. We expected the long wait, and we pre-ordered our pizza so it would be ready (or near enough) by the time we were seated. An hour later we get to our seats and the server takes our ticket for the pizza which should have been about done. About 35 minutes after that we had to flag our server to ask where the pizza was. He explained deep dish takes 40-45 minutes to bake and we explained we had ordered it over an hour and a half ago. He went to check and shortly after brought a deep dish pizza out with his apologies. The rest of the night went fine. Unfortunately it was only much later we realized he brought us a small when we had paid for a medium. (It was our first time there so we didn't realize the size difference until we ordered a medium two days later and saw how large it was.)
