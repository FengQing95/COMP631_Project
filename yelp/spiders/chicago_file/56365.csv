Smoque BBQ////Parking around here is pretty hard to find, and you might end up waiting a bit to be able to sit down, but the food makes it all worth it. My personal favorites are the baby back ribs, mac and cheese, and peach cobbler, but honestly everything they serve here is delicious. If you're not into sitting and eating somewhere crowded and noisy, they also do carry-out. Also, if you're not a fan of cole slaw but want to order a combo that comes with cole slaw as Â side, you can substitute cornbread instead.
