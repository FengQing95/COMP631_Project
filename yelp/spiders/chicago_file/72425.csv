Little Goat Diner////My coworker ordered the beef ravioli and really liked it. I ordered the patty melt which was very good. However, another issue with too thick onions on the patty melt. I love caramelized onions like the ones on my patty melt but I hate biting into a huge chunk of onion like that. I picked the big ones off and kept on enjoying my sandwich!
