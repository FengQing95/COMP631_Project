Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Also, this is kind of random, but I noticed that the restaurant was just really dusty.  I was admiring some of the pictures and other knick knacks on the walls... only to notice a good layer of dust and cobwebs.  Kind of disgusting as they're hanging directly over our tables of food.
