Little Goat Diner////The ambiance in this restaurant is very diner-esque, appropriately so. For example there are booths, and a counter with seats and old school menus. My server was a young woman that was friendly and willing to answer questions. Â I asked her about the goat chili fries and she confirmed my question about it being a large enough portion for dinner for one.
