Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The Blueberry Patch cocktail was very nice (blueberry vodka, blueberry jam, lemon juice, honey syrup and mint), although a little light on the alcohol. Kind of like a blueberry mojito. The free bread was also tasty, and the tapas were quite good. The best were the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, the warm potato & onion omelette, the roasted chicken empanada, and the rioja-braised short ribs w/ mashed potatoes. The seared spanish sausages (chorizo, txistorra, butifarra y morcilla) and the beef skewer, horseradish cream & red onions were solid, but by the time they arrived we were already stuffed.
