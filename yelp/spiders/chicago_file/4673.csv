The Purple Pig////Based on all the reviews on Yelp, it seems like there's always a long wait. However, I lucked out and only had to wait 15 minutes on Lolapalooza Sunday (around 5:30PM!!) I saw that they had a post-it note estimating how long the wait would be based on what time of day it is, so don't give up when the host tells you that the wait is super long! Be patient, and walk around magnificent mile while you're at it!
