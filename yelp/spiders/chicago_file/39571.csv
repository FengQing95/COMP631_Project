Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Everyone was very happy or ecstatic with their meals. The two people who ordered filet raved--terrific cuts, brilliantly prepared. With the maître d' butter, it was sinfully rich and tasty.  My wife was very happy with the salmon, although the preparation was a little sweet for her taste. The buttery mashed potatoes were a delight, made with chicken jus and garlic.
