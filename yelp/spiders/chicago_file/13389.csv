Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Best Pizza I've had...cheese, toppings and that "FAMOUS" butter crust make all the difference. Better than Gino's and Giordanao's. This location gets packed quickly and the wait time was 45 mins but the option to pre-order your pizza was very helpful. Â Must stop here on your next trip to Chicago
