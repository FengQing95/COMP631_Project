Smoque BBQ////I went here based on them being on Triple D. They did not disappoint! The process is pretty different than other restaurants, well at least in LA. First, order and pay at the counter, next a waiter has a table ready for your party. It was pretty crowded, but after ordering, I didn't wait at all for a table. The food was only a few minutes.
