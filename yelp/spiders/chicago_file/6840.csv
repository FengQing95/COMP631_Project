Art Institute of Chicago////Since the AIC is the 2nd largest museum in the US, I couldn't possibly see everything in one day... well I could, but I don't have the stamina, so I became a member so I could go back once or twice a month for an hour or 2 at a time and I never realized what a great collection the AIC has!
