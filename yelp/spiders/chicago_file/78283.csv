Little Goat Diner////My boyfriend and I split the pork belly pancake, los drowned, and pork belly home fries. I will tell you that the pork belly pancake is small ($13) and not a lot of pork belly at all. The los drowned tasted okay but for a sandwich $14 was pricey. As was the $8 pork belly home fries which didn't come with much either. I found that everything was really greasy and heavy and not in a good way. I barely got through the pork belly pancake and I can EAT. Everything tasted so oily and/or salty. And the idea of infusing Asian flavor with American classics was a great idea but I think the overall end pieces fell rather flat and just didn't go well together.
