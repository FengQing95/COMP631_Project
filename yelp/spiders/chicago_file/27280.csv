Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If I'm getting deep-dish, I'm going to Lou's. As a Chicago transplant, it's not in my distinct nature to eat deep-dish whenever I get a pizza craving. However, I've found that I like the overall ratio of Lou's the best. Their curst also has a butteriness that is incomparable to anywhere else.
