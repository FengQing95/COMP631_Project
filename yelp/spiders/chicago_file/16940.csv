Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The most authentic deep dish pizza in town. Usually pizza for delivery and take out tastes bad once you get home but lou malnatis always taste just as good as in the restaurant. The ingredients are so fresh and good. I recommend getting pepperoni tomatoes basil mushroom and peppers. It really is phenomenal!
