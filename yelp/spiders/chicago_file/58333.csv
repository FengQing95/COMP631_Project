Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////2. Cubano - favorite savory brunch item we tried. We ordered two orders of this classic sammie for our party of five. The bread kind of looks like an English muffin but tastes so much better. Rather than tasting like cardboard it was buttery and crispy on the outside and soft inside filled with tender pork shoulder, pickles, mustard aioli and manchego. What a combo!
