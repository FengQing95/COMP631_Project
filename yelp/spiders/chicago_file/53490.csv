Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Good food but a bit pricey for my taste. I very much enjoyed the ambience. Nice music, and rustic decor. I ordered the pintxos platter, shrimp with garlic, buttermilk-fried chicken thighs, and seared sea scallop. All of it was good, but the best thing I tasted was the buttermilk-fried chicken thighs. BEST FRIED CHICKEN I HAVE EVER TRIED.
