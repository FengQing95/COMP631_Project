Smoque BBQ////This local slaughterhouse puts every dime into its food. If your top priority is the tastiness of the cuisine (full disclosure: that's my #1 priority), then you've found the right place. If you're going for ambience, you may be disappointed. Customer service is average. The table setup reminds me more of a military mess hall (albeit the world's smallest mess hall) than a top-rated diner. There aren't even tablecloths. But this is my review and I focus on flavor. Fortunately, this place has the best BBQ north of Memphis. Oh, and bonus points for the money-saving combo of being waiter free (i.e. no tips or gratuity expected) and BYOB. Five blindingly bright stars.
