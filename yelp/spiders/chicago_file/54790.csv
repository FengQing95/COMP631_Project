Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We went here to celebrate my birthday (thanks for the chocolate mousse)! The seafood paella was super filling. Everything was good...loved the potatoes. Would recommend the passion fruit sangria over the traditional or mango sangria. My brother claims that this is his favorite restaurant of all times!!!
