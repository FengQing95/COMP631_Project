Smoque BBQ////I've been wanting to go to Smoque for quite a while now ever since a co-worker recommended it and I finally made it today.  WOW......should have made it a priority when he first told me about it cuz it was great!  I had the sliced brisket, which is like no  brisket I've ever had.  So tender and smokey, it melts in your mouth.  Great sauce to accompany it as well.  The corn bread was awesome, as was the cole slaw.  Didn't love the mac and cheese but I'm not a fan anyway.  I also tried the baby back ribs....which were also divine.  Tasted the pulled pork as well, which was awesome.  Next time.....Texas sausage and the chicken.  I want to go back tomorrow!  My new favorite BBQ place.  Thank goodness it's right around the corner from my niece's house.
