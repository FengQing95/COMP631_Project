Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I'm in Chicago 2-3 times a year, and this is a must-go-to place every time i'm in town ... It's always crowded (but in a good way - if that makes sense), I'm always with a group, we always get the sangria, and for some reason their's always an inordanate amount of good looking young women in groups of 4 or 5 ... though they've kind of jumped the shark opening up shop in Vegas.
