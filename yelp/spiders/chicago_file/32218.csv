Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Awful pizza! I came to Chicago in hopes of trying some great pizza and was suggested this spot by my Lyft driver. OMG, he definitely set me up for failure. Zero flavor, so crispy as if I was eating glass and undercooked calamari. I will never be returning to this establishment. I definitely wasted my money and time.
