Little Goat Diner////I'd like to like this restaurant, but I just can't. I've been here on four occasions, and each time I have left disappointed. I don't know where they get their beans, but the coffee always tastes stale. The lattes have no depth of flavor and are more cream than coffee. "This Little Piggy Went to China," a dish consisting of a sesame cheddar biscuit, eggs, szechuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries, is the biggest disappointment of all. The dish is ridiculously salty and the overuse of the chili garlic chive sauce borders on offensive. The sourdough pancakes are lack-luster. The service and ambiance is great, but who cares when the food is subpar.
