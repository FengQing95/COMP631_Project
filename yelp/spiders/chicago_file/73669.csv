Little Goat Diner////When the bartender repeats my order, only then do I hear the absence of the  "bourbon" and I say, "It has bourbon in it, right?" He comes back, "Oh you want bourbon in it!?"  **Whoa, who would drink that without bourbon in it!?** I guess someone who doesn't want to pay $15.28 for a milkshake! LOL Normally, this over expenditure would cause me to freak out a bit. I mean..FIFTEEN BUCKS? Levity then embraces me and I'm 'Free Fal-lin' like everyone around me. . .
