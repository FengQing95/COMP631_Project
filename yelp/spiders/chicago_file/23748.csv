Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////To top off our dinner, we had the individual serving of the chocolate chip pizza. Think of the pizookie from BJ's. Chocolate chip cookie baked in an iron clad pizza pan topped with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream and whipped cream. I like how you have the option to order this smaller size and not have to deal with that fattening regular size we're so use to getting. I think I may have liked this more than the pizookie actually. It takes about 10 minutes to come out so you may want to order this slightly beforehand. It was a great closer to our meal at Lou's.
