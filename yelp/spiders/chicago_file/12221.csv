Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute was one of few remaining reasons for visiting downtown. I will never step foot in that building again! Their decision to fire all of their mostly white female volunteers is sickening. Can you imagine the experience going forward with an uninterested staff? Will this staff have the same passion? Will they have the same knowledge of art? I would suggest anyone considering making a donation to the Art Institute look elsewhere.
