Little Goat Diner////Hubby and I had dinner at 8:15 pm on a Saturday night.  Seated right away with our Open Table reservation.  The restaurant was packed and lively. Opted for the restaurant week options for him and I had the shrimp and grits. Pre fixe items were a nosh board, fish and chips, and chocolate silk pie. We also ordered the sauteed brussel sprouts and Asian broccoli.  The veggies sides were ok, we have had better. The nosh board included pickled peppers, olives, various dips and hummus, an empanada and veggies. It was a nice combination of things and we enjoyed it. The fish and chips was ok; hubby liked the fish but not the sauce it came with. The shrimp and grits is delicious. We finished with the chocolate silk pie which, while a small portion, was really quite good. We probably won't be returning anytime soon but it's worth a visit to say you went.
