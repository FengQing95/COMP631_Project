Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is by far my favorite steakhouse in Chicago. The ambiance is cozy and private, perfect for celebrating a special event with your special someone. The steaks are stunning, perfectly aged and seasoned. If you're going to eat here, then treat yourself and get the dry aged bone-in ribeye. Honestly, it was more than enough for two. Cooked how a steak should be (medium rare) without anything fancy sauce or garnishes. Along with the steak, we ordered the thick cut bacon which was sinfully delicious and the crab cakes. The crab cakes took me by surprise, and I still dream about them. I realized every other crab cake I'd previously eaten was a joke, I couldn't possibly even put it in the same category. This crab cake was filled with thick chunks of fresh crab meat. Every crab cake I've encountered since has paled by comparison.
