Smoque BBQ////The food here is so amazing. I generally hate BBQ, and my mouth is watering thinking of their brisket sandwich. Mac and cheese is also great, as is their peach cobbler. My only complaint is that we called ahead to order takeout at 3 pm on a Saturday, and it still took over an hour to get, including over 20 minutes waiting in the restaurant before they gave us our takeout. It's the only thing keeping me from coming back all the time, because the food is outrageously good.
