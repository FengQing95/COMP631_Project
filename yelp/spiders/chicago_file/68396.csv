Little Goat Diner////Our waiter was totally absent. After we ordered, he was just nowhere to be found. It took us about 15 minutes to track him down to order a second drink (by the way, we ordered entrees, small plates, and booze, so he was in for a potentially good tip if he just provided minimum service). After ordering it, it took him 10 minutes to deliver it, and I seriously considered telling him I no longer wanted it. He did not offer us a dessert menu, and ran away before we could ask for one. Fine. It took us TWENTY minutes to get him to come back to the table in order to get the check. We had to ask the hostess for help finding him, and he couldn't even make eye contact when he finally returned with it. It took at least ten minutes to get him to process it and come back. In his defense, he looked busy, but if he had mentioned to us that he had a lot of tables or that someone had called in, we would have cut him more slack- Â it was his attitude in combination with the long wait times that was just unacceptable.
