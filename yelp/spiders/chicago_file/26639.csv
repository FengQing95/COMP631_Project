Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza was good. It was on the cheesier side without it being hot and stringy (-___-). The butter crust was good, since that butta gave it an extra flavoring than plain bread. Overall I wasn't blown away but it was good. We finished the entire pizza. It was definitely shareable.
