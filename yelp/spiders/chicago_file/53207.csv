Smoque BBQ////The mac 'n' cheese, however, merits its own picture.  This was dangerously delicious.  All I had to say about it was, "Oh my God.  This is what mac 'n' cheese is supposed to taste like?"  I've never been a mac 'n' cheese person but maybe because I've never had a good one.  Until now.  It was creamy and cheesy and moist.  Not at all dry and sticky with pasta so overcooked it's impossible to stab, like most versions I've tasted in the past.  This one was worth the calories!
