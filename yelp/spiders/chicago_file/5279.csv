The Purple Pig////Then there's the pork belly and tenderloin. I think this was my favorite dish there. The pork belly by itself was so tender and full of flavors I wasn't sure if it needed the tenderloin. Then I ate them together. I honestly had to let everything settle for a minute after I ate it, wanted to savor every bite. The tenderloin by itself isn't impressive but together the texture works so well with how soft the pork belly is.
