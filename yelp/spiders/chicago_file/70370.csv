Little Goat Diner////I went with the Reuben.  I love the reuben as a no fail sandwich and feel like you can never go wrong.  The Kim chi inside the sandwich threw me for a loop, but all was well. I totally dug the extra crunch and spice it gave this traditional sandwich!  It also all tasted great for leftovers the next day (I was a bit worried about this- no problems).
