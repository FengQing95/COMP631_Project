Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////when i first moved here, folks told me i 'had' to eat here.   well, i ate there twice and each time afterward, it felt like my lower GI was going to explode.  i don't know if it's the combination of grease, sangria and the little ham weiner thingies, but this place makes me turn green.  somehow, i don't really think spanish tapas are supposed to taste like this.
