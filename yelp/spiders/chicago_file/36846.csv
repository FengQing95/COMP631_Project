Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I took my main squeeze here for Valentine's Day. I booked several weeks in advance, but the best I could get through Open Table was a 9:30 reservation. I called a few days later, asking if maybe they had something earlier. I was told no, but that they would "make a note" that I'd like something earlier. I shrugged that off, but got a call a few weeks later informing me that an 8:45 was available. That, in and of itself, led me to believe I was in for a great experience. (Full disclosure: we showed up 20 minutes late. Oh, the irony.)
