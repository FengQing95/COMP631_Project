Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is my favorite pan pizza, and that's saying a lot when you live in Chicago!  My go-to is the Malnati Chicago Classic, which features lean delicious sausage and extra mozzarella cheese topped with vine-ripened chunky tomato sauce, all on a buttery yet crunchy crust.  That Pizza, by itself, would make anyone happy as can be.  But take my advice and start with the Malnati Salad (Romaine lettuce, tomatoes, black olives, Volpi salami, Gorgonzola cheese) and for God's sake, DO NOT forget to slather on the Sweet Vinaigrette, made special in house.  It will blow your hair back, knock your socks off, and satisfy the bejeezus out of you.  Enjoy!!
