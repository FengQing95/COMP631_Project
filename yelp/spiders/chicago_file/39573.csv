Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////From beginning to end, the experience was just about flawless. Bavette's Bar & Boeuf is worth the price, which didn't seem outlandish for the quality of food and service. We escaped for under $100 per person (including tip) with one drink apiece, salads, entrees, and a side and two desserts split between three people.
