Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Everyone always talks about the sangria because its true: its so refreshing that you will forget that you need to drive later. Heck, one might go as far as giving it to their children on accident because it takes you back in time to the good ol days of sipping on some juice. If you live near walking-distance or are above the law, try all three pitchers! You wont regret it (maybe later).
