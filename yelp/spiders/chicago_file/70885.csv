Little Goat Diner////My fruit bowl didn't look very appetizing, but it was really delicious. It was a definite BOWL of fruit and I couldn't even finish it. We shared some fries and macaroni and cheese, which were also delicious and were reasonably sized. I definitely plan on heading back to this place when I can so I can fully experience and enjoy their menu!
