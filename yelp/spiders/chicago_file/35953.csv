Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Made a reservation for dinner, and arrive a couple of minutes early (4:58 pm). Upon arrival, I was soaking wet, despite having a raincoat and umbrella. The hostess was incredibly rude, not just to me, but other patrons (one woman asked about towels in the restroom, and got an eye roll) waiting to be seated. I asked if I could visit the ladies room, and she refused my request. Even as I left the restaurant she maintained her sullen and unfriendly demeanor. Not sure why restaurants hire such unpleasant people to greet the public. Can't be good for business.
