Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The meat is excellent. My mother and I shared the burger and a petite duchesse filet mignon. We both like our meat well done. It was still tender and with plenty of taste. The burger might very well be my new favorite in Chicago. The side dishes - creamed spinach and sugary sweet potatoes - were delicious. A must try!!
