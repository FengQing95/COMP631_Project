The Purple Pig////My fianc√© and I came here around 6:30 pm for dinner and didn't have reservations. There was a 45 minute wait for a table ( way better than the two hour waits at other restaurant in Chicago!!). We ended up being able to find a spot for two at the bar within 5 minutes of waiting so decided to sit at the bar!
