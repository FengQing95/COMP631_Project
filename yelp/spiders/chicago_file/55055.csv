Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We had some celebrating to do for match day and we wanted to find a tapas restaurant. This is an awesome restaurant. The space is massive and it has a lot of room for large parties. You get to sample all sorts of delicious food. Each dish is prepared perfectly and the ingredients really stand out. They are simple but you can tell everything is high quality. The highlights for us were burrata, octopus, and scallops. The octopus was outstanding and cooked to absolute perfection. I could have eaten 10lbs worth. We are enjoyed the Serrano ham, cheese plate, Brussel sprouts, and squid. Those dishes were also amazing. We will be back after my girlfriend graduates medical school.
