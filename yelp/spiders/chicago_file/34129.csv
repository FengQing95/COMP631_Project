Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////What a fantastic experience! We walked in hoping to score seats at the bar and were very pleased to find room. I started with the salmon tartare which turned out to be a generous portion and more than enough to share. We ordered a bottle of wine from their expansive and impressive list and followed up with main courses of steak - of course! The steak was absolutely divine: perfectly cooked, seasoned and delivered piping hot. I choose a side of fully loaded baked potato and couldn't be happier. The potato was almost the size of my head! As if the evening couldn't get better, the bartender, Damien, was an absolute delight and real pro. He was fantastic at his job and lit up our evening with his engaging conversation throughout our meal. A definite 5 star experience. Just WOW!
