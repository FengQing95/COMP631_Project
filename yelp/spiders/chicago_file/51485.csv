Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Have been going to Cafe Ba Ba Reba since they opened. Never been disappointed! They've been open for all these years because the food is of the top quality, the service is superb and it's a nice clean place. This time we had the garlic shrimp , bacon wrapped dates, beef empanadas and short ribs. The short ribs are some the best you'll ever have. The only thing better than the food was the service. Our server Tatum, could not have been more attentive and sweeter! She great! Try this establishment, you won't be disappointed!
