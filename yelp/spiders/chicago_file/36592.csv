Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My mom and I luckily snuck in for an early dinner without reservations and were seated right away. The atmosphere is very charming - completely transports you out of modern Chicago and back in time. Hosts and wait staff were friendly. The complimentary bread was warm and fantastic; we asked for another round. I thought the oysters were pretty good, considering we're in the Midwest and not really near oyster harvesting waters. We shared the 22oz ribeye with bone marrow and a loaded baked potato. The meat had great natural flavors but was overly salty. Otherwise, no complaints for the food. Prices are fair considering the venue. You can actually get away with a reasonably priced meal if you select the right options from their menu. Good place for a date or business dinner.
