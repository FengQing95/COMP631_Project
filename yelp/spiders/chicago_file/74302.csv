Little Goat Diner////Walked in on a Sunday night around 7:30pm right after a big storm had passed through so we weren't sure what to expect in terms of wait time. I live nearby and the place always looks jammed - so try to avoid going during premium hours. There were a lot of people waiting around the front door but I figured I would ask if they had a spot for two, which it turns out they had more seats than that open at the bar near the kitchen. For drinks we ordered a Moscow Goat (Grapefruit Juice, Gin, Ginger Beer) and a BBQ Picnic (I think thats what it was called) which tasted just like you were sipping Sweet Baby Ray's. I mean that in a good way, it was a great combination of juices/spices and local Chicago Distillery's "Finn's Gin" that left a pleasant mesquite lay's potato chip flavor lingering in your mouth. Seriously - nice job whoever came up with that.
