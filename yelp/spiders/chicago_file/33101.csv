Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I had two mint juleps. I always get stuck on a cocktail. The mint julep is to Bavette's as the violet smash is to Maude's - nobody understands it, everybody likes it. It doesn't really taste julep, but it tastes like something awesome. The parlor is downstairs and features more men in vests, one of who (the fabulous Mike B., now at the bar too) created me what I think was some type of customized beautiful corpse reviver that I wish I remembered more of. It looks like The Office had a child with Curio but on the way borrowed a few chromosomes from Au Cheval. That's the downstairs.
