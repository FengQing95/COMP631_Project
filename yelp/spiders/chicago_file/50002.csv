Smoque BBQ////Just 2 quick blocks from the Irvington Park train stop which makes walking very possible. Be ready to wait around an hour to get seated but the food is great and well worth the wait. The allow you to take it to go or work to find your party a table to grab a seat. All the food is great. Worth it!
