Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After what seemed like forever, (30 minutes) the "Cookie Pizza" finally arrived and was horrible... Nothing more then a cold, stale cookie served with a scoop of ice cream on top (probably to hide the abysmal quality of the cookie). Why it took 30 minutes to prepare this horrible thing is still questionable to me,. Certainly NOT worth that type of wait.
