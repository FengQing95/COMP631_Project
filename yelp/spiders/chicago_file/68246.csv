Little Goat Diner////I could eat here every day of the week. Stephanie Izzard has a knack for creating quite inventive and incredibly tasty food. The Little Goat, an offshoot of her acclaimed Girl and the Goat is the casual diner version of her incredible culinary creativity. Try it. You are sure to find something you will rave about later. We had the absolute pleasure of having Megan as our server. She was fantastic and made the meal that much better. Â Kudos all around.
