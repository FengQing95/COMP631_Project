Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is one of my favorite (if not my absolute favorite) restaurants in Chicago! I recommend making a reservation to ensure you get a table, as this place gets packed during peak hours and on weekends. I'm a fan of tapas, and Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba has some seriously good tapas. I highly recommend the bacon-wrapped dates, the sherry-tomato meatballs, and the garlic-red pepper shrimp! The candle-lit setting with its chatty ambiance and delicious smells from the kitchen make for a fun evening. We love the sangria options, and the sangria-of-the-day is neat since it's always something unique (desert pear, mango, blood orange, etc.). We've never had a server without a smile, and we've never left hungry. They also have a great Happy Hour at both bars from 4p-6p on weekdays and 10p-12a on Friday & Saturday that offers 1/2 price sangria and very, very discounted tapas dishes!
