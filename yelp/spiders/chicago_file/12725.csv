Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////this pizza barely crosses the line into mediocrityville.  it would be decent if it weren't for the crust.  i even upgraded to the "butter crust" for an additional $0.75.  lifeless and banal, the dough reminded me of this one time when i was trying to adjust my rugby cleats and had to try and move this strange cardboard insert with my mouth as my hands were tied up with other parts of the shoe.
