Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Now on to the steaks. Why on earth do you bring to my table a dish of steak seasoning salt even before I get my steak!? Â You are admitting defeat before I even get my meal. You are literally telling me you can't properly season a steak. You know the worst part? You're right. You actually need the seasoning salt because the steaks were bland. Literally no flavor. Which was a tragedy because the cuts of meat were superb. Fork tender filet that melted in your mouth. But the lack of proper seasoning is unforgivable when paying $60 for a steak. And it wasn't just a mishap with 1 steak but happened with both cuts.
