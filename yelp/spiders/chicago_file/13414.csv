Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////All I can say is.....HEAVEN.  It's funny cause i was just in the sf bay area and my girl took me to a "Chicago style" deep dish pizzeria.  Boys and girls can you say "yuck"!  As you can see I was dying to take my girl this past weekend to a REAL Chicago deep dish joint.  Lou's known for their buttery crust, delivered when we chomped down on the medium sausage deep dish.  Talk about bliss baby...this was the sh....t!  The medium is more than enuf for a couple unless ur Godzilla and king kong.  Oh, don't miss the Lou chopped salad, which Oaklanders would say that is was "hella" good.  Crisp romaine, topped with olives, tomatoes, bleu cheese, red onions a warm sweet vinaigrette and the ingredient that made it the bomb.....BACON BITS!!!  Enjoy the meal with your choice of libation and the night was pure Chicago bliss! Cheers!
