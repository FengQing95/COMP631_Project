Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This has been on my list of restaurants to try in Chicago for awhile now, and Lou Malnati's definitely did not disappoint!  We came on a Thursday afternoon, right after the lunch rush.  The wait was about 20 minutes after checking in with the hostess, and then we got into a line to pre-order our pizza so that they could get started on it while we waited for our table.  The waitress was super friendly once seated, but it did take a while for our pizza to come out considering we had ordered it in advance.  We ordered the Chicken BBQ Club salad to start, which was amazing!  The portion was generous, and was a good starter for the three of us.  We also ordered a medium "Lou," and added sausage on the recommendation of the hostess.  This was more than enough for the recommended three people, and we even had a couple of large slices left over.  Everything tasted great, but I will say the pizza is pretty heavy if you are not used to eating deep dish style pizza!
