Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Two days later I returned for breakfast with the same collegue, but, I was off work due to some friends coming into town out of state.  They wanted to tour the city before they departed to go home, so we popped in for breakfast.  Somehow, we were given time to order, but after that, staff was at our table every 30 seconds to rush us out of there.  My friend couldn't even keep her glass of soda due to a hand from a resturant staffer snatching it away.  It didn't matter if we were finished or not, someone was by, asking us over and over again if we were done, stealing whatever empty dishes they could find.
