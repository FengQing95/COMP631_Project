Little Goat Diner////Wow.....Little Goat serves up some good stuff. This place has a really nice "package". The service was super, the ambiance is contemporary diner-esque, and the food is da BOMB. They offer typical diner fare with their own cool little twists. My husband had the smoked corned beef hash, which was awesome as well.
