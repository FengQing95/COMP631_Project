Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great meal/experience and after dining here last night, I know why it's so popular and hard to get into. Food was delicious, however I have a 4 star because of how much salt and cream is used in the dishes which is a pet peeve of mine at places as nice as this. We had the Cesar salad with smoked white fish which was one of the best ones I have ever had. If you love smoked fish it's a MUST. We had the stroganoff which was excellent too, however a bit too rich in cream/flavor.
