Smoque BBQ////Joint is overrated. Hard to believe that people will stand in line 40+ minutes for the oil-soaked fries, overly sweet BBQ'ed beans, flavorless slaw, and dried out cornbread I had last night on my first and likely last visit to Smoque. You know the feeling of disappointment when you blow your week's diet on something rich and decadent that doesn't even taste that good? Exactly.
