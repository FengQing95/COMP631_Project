Smoque BBQ////This place has the most amazing brisket ever in life. So good that I've been obsessing pretty hard lately. I go every other week, and though I just went this past Friday I'm fighting the urge to go again today (Sunday) for more! I'm pretty sure they know me and my husband by now lol. So should I go again?! Haha help me out guys. They need a program for this or something. Their St. Louis ribs are pretty amazing too. Sooo much goodness!
