Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The atmosphere is very close and definitely alive with people having a great time.  If you are looking for a quiet dinner this may not be the place you are looking for.  I highly recommend reservations as it gets very crowded.  There is a lot of seating in different rooms, but it always seems to be packed.
