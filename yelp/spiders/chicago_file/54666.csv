Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We got a variety of different plates-some of my favorites were the Brussels sprout salad, chicken with peri peri sauce and steak with mashed potatoes. My favorite was hands down the burrata: the bread was crispy and light, the spread, which was sweeter than I anticipated, complemented the fresh mozzarella perfectly. Its like biting into a little cheesy piece of Heaven. The chorizo dates, which are $2 for one, are worth a try as well. They were warm and amazing and I probably could've eaten 5 more.
