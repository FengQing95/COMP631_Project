Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Was told that this is a must try place when visiting Chicago and Lou Malnatis did not disappoint! The slices are very big and I could only eat two. I think a medium is more than enough for two people. We had the Lou special and the Chicago classic. Both are very good! Don't forgot try the wings!
