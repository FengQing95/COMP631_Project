Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I got the Deluxe Individual, which was PERFECTly sized for me and I am stuffed! (Although if you are a boy, I would suggest getting the Small) The sausage was the best part of the pizza. I couldn't believe how delicious the Italian sausage tasted and green peppers, mushrooms, and onions were so incredibly fresh! There were toppings a plenty..and just the perfect amount of cheese! It wasn't gooopy at all like other Chicago deep dish pizzas...it was perfection! I have died and gone to pizza heaven!!! This was completely amazing.
