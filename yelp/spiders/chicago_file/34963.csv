Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Why not 5 stars? Everything was super salty. No one dish was necessarily ruined by the salt (except perhaps the frites, which were not only over-salted but also soft, doughy, and greasy), but everyone felt pretty bloated after just sharing a few bites of every dish. I can't imagine eating an entire entree plus an appetizer here. Also, single bathrooms for a restaurant this size? Not cool.
