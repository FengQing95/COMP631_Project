Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////To start off, I cannot say enough great things about Hogsalt Hospitality and the different establishments they manage. As a huge fan of Au Cheval, Small Cheval, Sawada Coffee, Gilt Bar, The Library, and Green Street Smoked Meats I was so excited to try Bavette's Bar and Boeuf and experience another Hogsalt managed restaurant. To note, one of my favorite things about them is their corkage policy. At Hogsalt restaurants, you can bring in any bottle of wine for 2 people with their corkage policy being that a glass needs to be shared with another diner.
