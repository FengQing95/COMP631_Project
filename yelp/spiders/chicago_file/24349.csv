Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They have gluten free pizza and it was pretty good! Crust was very well done but the sauce and toppings were excellent! Bloody Mary came with cheese and pepperoni which was delicious but the bar tender was all over the place. The restaurant was warm and muggy inside and very very loud. My friend had the deep dish pizza and said it was good! All the food was very filling! Definitely worth trying but come hungry!
