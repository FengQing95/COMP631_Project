Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Shrimp with garlic, olive oil and red pepper flakes. // Now, there is about (estimate) 5 shrimp in this dish. But, the olive oil and garlic that is left in the dish after the shrimp is 3/4 of the reason why we keep getting it. People say shun the bread basket because it just makes you full... well I say order seconds and don't LET the waiter take that bowl away. Dip it!!
