Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I got there around 1pm on a Tuesday (July 4th), party of 3 and there was no wait. First thing I noticed after I was seated were the dirty utensils and plates (they were crusty). I immediately asked for new ones but, they only remembered once the food was out, and realized I had no utensils to eat with.
