Smoque BBQ////Traveling in Chicago I usually go looking for great food and at Smoque, Â I FOUND IT! For me BBQ is an art and a destination and I won't travel 30 mins by train for bad or even mediocre BBQ. And I came to this place at the recommendation of a friend and I was not disappointed, but I should have listened to him, he said "get the ribs" but I wanted to taste everything. I made my own sample platter of 1/4 rack of ribs, a smoked sausage, a serving of puked pork and serving of sliced brisket. And a pile of hand cut fries. All of the meats were very good, but the ribs....they were exceptional!! I sampled all the meats with both the Carolina sauce and the Memphis sauce and all of them alone. For me the meats were good and all really appreciated the sauce, but the ribs, (falloff the bone, could cut them with a plastic knife) I could have eaten and loved them with just the rub, and then when I sauced the ribs with the bolder Memphis style sauce, WOW! What a terrific combination of flavor, texture, smoke and sas!! So when I come again (and I will definitely come back) personally I will go for the ribs, get a full rack and be in BBQ HEAVEN! Come for the BBQ, stay for the ribs and enjoy this little corner of Smokey Chicago!
