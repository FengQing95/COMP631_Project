Art Institute of Chicago////What can I say? When I visited the Art Institute for the first time last year I was actually not looking that forward to it...I was like...alright, whatever, let's go. But once I got inside I fell in love!  Such great pieces, so much to see, excellent layout...I loved all the Rothkos and the more contemporary pieces which they have a lot of.  It wasn't crowded when I went (not sure how it normally is) so there was no traffice and it was easy to get up close to the paintings.  I also like the way it flowed inside, from room to room, and the way the art was displayed.
