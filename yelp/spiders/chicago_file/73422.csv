Little Goat Diner////) tried to do the sweet & savory mix (which I usually LOVE) but something was just off about the taste - It was overpoweringly sweet. The first bite was good... then I just started to feel sick with how much maple syrup was drenched all over. I wish I could've taken a bite of the sweet french toast, and then taken a bite of the savory chicken, but everything on the plate just tasted like one flavor - the syrup.
