Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The tuna arrived first, and instead of tuna it was covered with chopped cauliflower. We both dug around and could find no tuna. The server came over and we showed it to him and he apologized and took it away to be remade. Once it came back correctly, it was very good. In fact, the server brought us an extra order of it, which was nice. I loved the smear of avocado on the crusty bread.
