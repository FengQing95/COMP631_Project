Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I dream about "The Lou" deep dish pizza. I am from Chicago and Lou's has always been my favorite deep dish with their butter crust and sauce that has chunks of tomatoes vs just a paste. When I went to college in FL, I used to stock up on the take out frozen pizzas to fly back with me. I've even flown 8 pizzas to Toronto and my Canadian friends haven't stopped talking since. Ice tried the other deep dish pizzas in Chicago and there's no competition!
