Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great server Amy - made good suggestions on drink - some type of excellent raspberry martini and the hubby's rib eye was so tasty. I got beef stroganoff - slightly sweet Asian was tasty n we split a huge baked potato with the works. The bread was pretty amazing too. We had to try the chocolate creme pie and it was melt in your mouth fantastic. Definitely would come back again as we loved the old Chicago feel and decor. I did reserve 1 month in advance and only able to get 9:15 on a Thursday night.
