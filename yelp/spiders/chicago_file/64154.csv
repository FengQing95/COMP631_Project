Smoque BBQ////Some guy told us to order our food first and he would put together a table for our party of 5. The entire place probably only seated about 25 or 30 people. We were seated by the window, right next to the counter where the food came out. We probably waited about 10 minutes, maybe less before our orders were called. You help yourself to plastic utensils and there are plenty of napkin dispensers on the tables. Important detail: the napkins came out from the top so they were easy to pull with your bbq-laden hands. Very important to have easy access to napkins.
