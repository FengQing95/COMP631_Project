Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Soup was pretty good. Service was so-so - unimpressive considering how few people were actually at the restaurant. Then out came the pizza in all its glory. I have to admit that I was far less impressed with the classic than I was with the plain old cheese. The crust and dough was absolutely spectacular but the ingredients themselves overpowered the pizza (which by the way is really heavy). I'd recommend sticking to 1 ingredient to really enjoy the flavor.
