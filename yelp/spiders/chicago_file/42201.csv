Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Anytime I have guests in town. They have to come to Ba-Ba-Reeba and are never disappointed. The food is terrific- there's a soft spot in my heart for the Curry Chicken Salad. The spicy potatoes are awesome. Too many amazing dishes to list. The desserts are tiny (two could suffice for one person... I've been known to scarf three...) and amazing. Good Sangria (bit expensive, nothing special). The atmosphere is great (don't come if you're looking for quiet). Plan ahead- especially with large parties. Having reservations mid-week for a weekend meal wouldn't be a bad thing.
