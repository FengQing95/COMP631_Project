Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We had the best dining experience of our lives at Bavette's. And we eat out a lot! From the moment we walked in the door, got seated and met our server to the moment we walked out of the restaurant, bellies full and smiles on our faces. The service was impeccable and a team effort, we never wanted or waited for anything. Five seconds after we placed our dessert order, someone else was there placing dessert silverware in front of us...we noted and appreciated the level of communication between staff that's required for that kind of seamless service. But it wasn't over the top. Most of it was done quietly without interruption. And no one hovered. Our main server was witty and informative. An expert with the menu and service.
