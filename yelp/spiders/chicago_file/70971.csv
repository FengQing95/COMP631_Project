Little Goat Diner////Good place for breakfast and beer (or wine) if you are in the area. The menu has many tasty choices, like everything on it. Pancakes come out hot and fluffy, waffles topped with yum, the omelettes bursting with flavor and sammiches that I just can't help but omnomnom. Don't forget the burgers! The almighty goat burger needs to be tried at least once in your life. It would make the Little Goat happy you did. Baaaa!
