Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lovely tiny blonde waitress took our order,  warned us pizza  takes 45 minutes to come out, brought drinks and then disappeared after she dropped off the pizza (to their credit it was only 30 minutes).  When we asked for check she asked if we wanted a refill. Yes we did,  ten minutes ago.
