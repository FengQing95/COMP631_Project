Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's did not disappoint! I read reviews where people had to wait hours for a table but when my boyfriend and I walked in we got seated within 5 minutes! woohoo! The waiter Jason was awesome and explained to us that it would take about 30-45 mins for the pizza which was reasonable and told us that if we are really hungry we should order some appetizers or a salad to hold us down.
