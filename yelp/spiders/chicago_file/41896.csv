Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of my favorite places to eat in the city! I have not been here for a few years, but again it did not disappoint! Great for groups, as there is something for everyone. The sangria is a must and is soooo good. We all ordered one dish and then ate it and then took another round of different dishes. Everything was delicious ans some of the favorites were the goat cheese marinara, ham and chicken corquettes, beed tenderloin with blue cheese, dates and the sausages. Excellent service and we were all stuffed for only $30 per person.
