Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I came here for a friend's birthday dinner during Restaurant Week.  Double whammy!  To save the RW frustration, my friend made 7:30 reservations and we all arrived promptly at 7:15.  We weren't seated until a little after 8pm.  Yep, that's right.  Oh, I can hear you all now..."but it's Restaurant Week!!"  Sorry, no.  That's not an excuse and I made sure to let the hostess know that we were very unsatisfied.
