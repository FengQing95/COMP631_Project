Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Service: Aight. This is the only thing that deterred me from a five-star rating. Walking in, it's not the friendliest crew. From the hostess who practically smirked when I asked what the wait was for 2 to the waiter that forgot about us for stretches of times. Once I pulled out the perturbed, black guy card, though- all was fine.
