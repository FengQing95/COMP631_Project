Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Between the four of us, we had around 10 tapas before dessert. I was struck by how perfectly cooked and seasoned every single dish was. Seriously, everything we tried was amazing. I particularly enjoyed the stuffed mushrooms (as I love mushrooms...), grilled salmon, and moroccan chicken. Â
