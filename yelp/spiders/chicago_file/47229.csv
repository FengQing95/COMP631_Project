Smoque BBQ////The chicken has an amazing smokedwood smell and taste. While it was very flavorful, it was dry and the portion was small. It says 1/2 chicken, but this was a 'small' chicken for the price tag. My husband had the brisket and he gives it a "10". It was juicy, tender, and balanced very well with the BBQ sauce. Will be back.
