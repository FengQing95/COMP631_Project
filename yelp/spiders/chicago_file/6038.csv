The Purple Pig////Lamb ribs were also tasty and a good portion size as well. Not a huge fan of the barbecue sauce as I thought it was too sweet, and then adding the creamy lime sauce was just a little strange to me. However the tomatoes on this thing were soooo scrumptious and the meat was fall off the bone tender. Despite the sauce I still really enjoyed this dish
