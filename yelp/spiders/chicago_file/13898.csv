Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////UPDATE - Bernie, the Manager at the location just called to apologize and get more information about the experience - she is looking into the tip issue to understand the issue we had that night, but perhaps more noteworthy, she is going to send a gift certificate to ensure we give them another chance. At the end of the day these issues happen and I think we all understand that, but it is how you handle the issues that separates a restaurant I will give another try compared to those I give up on...looking forward to a better experience next time!
