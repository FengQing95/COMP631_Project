Little Goat Diner////This place can be really crowded, luckily they started taking reservations (at least for lunch, I haven't made one for dinner), so it's a little easier to get in. I also love the rooftop in the summer. It is a lot smaller than the restaurant itself so it's hard to find a seat up there, but it is definitely worth it on those beautiful summer evenings.
