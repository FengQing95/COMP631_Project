Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My group of 5 came here after eating lunch and we were all so full. However, we had to come try out the famous Lou Malnati Pizza. We ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic and The Lou. You can just see the melted cheese oozing out. The pizza was good. I liked the classic more than the Lou but they were both very good.
