Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is great! I love the bacon covered dates their always on point. And my cousin has gluten issues and a lot of the items on the menu are gluten free, which I thought was really cool. Great for big parties! The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because I make reservations there and you still have to wait a decent forty min. Not including the time it takes for your food to get to you.
