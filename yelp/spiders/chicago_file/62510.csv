Smoque BBQ////SO...all in all...Smoque has some pretty good meat, but the sauce issue is infuriating! If I could bring in my own bottle of Sweet Baby Rays, I might have a totally different view. BYOSauce! But as it stands, if some buddies say "Hey let's goto Smoque!" I won't protest, but I'm not excited for a repeat. Next time I go, though, I'm definitely getting more St. Louis Ribs and bringing my own sauce!
