Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is the best steakhouse I have ever been to. I am not a huge steak person, but my husband and I ordered the 75 day aged bone in rib eye and it was absolutely delicious. A year later and we are still talking about it. And I also love the speakeasy vibe of the restaurant. Most people in there wore jeans and T-shirts, which is fine, but I think the restaurant, the food and the atmosphere warrant getting dressed up a bit because it is definitely a date night or celebration type restaurant. Will definitely visit went back in Chicago!
