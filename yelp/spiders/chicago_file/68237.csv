Little Goat Diner////My friend decided on the grilled cheese which was a surprisingly huge sandwich and not what you expect in a grilled cheese. I didn't get a chance to taste it but he seemed to enjoy it. I did however, snag several of his smoked fries. Like our waiter said, there isn't really a smokey flavor to these so don't be turned away by the "smoked" name.
