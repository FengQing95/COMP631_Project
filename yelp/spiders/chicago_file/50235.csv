Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We were seated relatively quickly and began our culinary crusade (too soon?) through the treasures of Espana. Naturally, we started our journey out right with a pitcher of passion fruit sangria. A pitcher of red and a pitcher of white, and I think another pitcher of red were also ordered during the course of this meal. I thoroughly enjoyed all of them, but I would have liked it a little stronger and with a little more fruit. It might be considered too sweet for some, but I thought it was perfectly balanced.
