Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went here for Sunday brunch while my parents came to visit(check up on me) last wkend. Overall, this restaurant puts on a really nice brunch, and the new patio is really pretty and a nice ambiance. It's a nice classy, place to bring guests too and not pretentious at all. In fact, the waitstaff is always so friendly and attentive, and know their menu well and offer great suggestions. Their sangrias are delicious and freshest I've ever had- definitely try the passion fruit sangria. The brunch menu is tasty, and very reasonable prices on the brunch tapas. The French toast is to die for, and since it is small, you don't feel like a total glutton. The shortcomings to me, as odd as it sounds, are the chairs. The patio has metal, tiny, flimsy chairs which I found kind of odd and uncomfortable. They reminded me of the cheap folding chairs from a grade school assembly or something. I feel like they could upgrade a bit here. Also, as delicious as everything on the menu is, there's not a huge selection and the menu is rarely updated. Maybe it's just me, but I like choices. Overall, a classic tapas restaurant in the heart of LP, that's sure to be a crowd pleaser.
