Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Was tipped about this place on Chowhound. Unfortunately, this place books up weeks in advance, so I was fortunate to go on a Monday night and grab 2 seats at the bar on the main level as you walk in. Full menu service available at the bar (though I would love a nice comfy booth with red tufted leather on my next visit).
