Smoque BBQ////* Details: Their sauce is a little runny but pretty good -- I'm picky in this regard and I liked it enough to use most of it.  Pulled pork was excellent; I liked the fattiness and moisture and the roll was a nice sweet compliment to the pork.  Could use a pickle.  The St Louis ribs were okay by me; I didn't think they were far and away better than Carsons, but likely better than Robinsons, Twin Anchors, and most chains.  French fries were very, very good -- lots of flavor and very crispy.  Baked beans were also very good -- a couple different types of beans, plenty of porky goodness.  The corn bread comes in a funny little tin.  The tin is actually a pain in the ass and the corn bread isn't anything special.
