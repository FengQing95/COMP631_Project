Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The layering of the Pizza is almost perfect with every damn bite so fulfilling. The tomatoes were diced perfectly and cooked to perfection. One of my biggest reasons for always taking a regular slice over a deep dish type is some places always leave that sourness of the tomatoes in and I hate that. These tomatoes had a nice sweetness to them and I loved it!
