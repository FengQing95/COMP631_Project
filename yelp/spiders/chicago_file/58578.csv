Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Love this place! It is my go to spot to take out of towners.  They have great Sangria pitchers and everyone usually picks 2-3 tapas for the table.  There is not a single thing on the menu that I wouldn't recommend.  I love tapas and the atmosphere and it's definitly a great place to come with a group of 4-6 so you can try all types of dishes.  I have also tried the paella, which I though was pretty good, but I think I prefer the tapas just for the fun of trying so many new things.  Everyone I have brought here has loved it, and even the non-wine drinkers loved the Sangria!  If you haven't been already - make a reservation (a must) and get some of their delicious food!  Just typing this has made me want to make my own reservation!!
