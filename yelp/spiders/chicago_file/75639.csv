Little Goat Diner////Why can I only give 5 stars???!!???  This place is soooo unbelievably amazing!!!  The line is ALWAYS Out the door which is great for me because I usually come alone and can sit at the counter.  The service is great even with people hanging off the rafters. Everytime I come to Chicago I make time for a visit. The food is just phenomenal. You can tell Chef Izard trains her people well!!!
