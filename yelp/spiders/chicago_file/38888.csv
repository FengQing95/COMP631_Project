Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////On to my experience, I had a 9 PM reservation for 2. My guest could not make it, so I went stag because I was so excited to finally try Bavette's. I arrived and was seated maybe 5 min after my reservation. They placed me at a high top in the back of the restaurant, on a stool, next to the bathroom. First bad move. If I'm paying $100+ for dinner, I'd like a back to my seat. If only to hang my soon to be lighter purse.
