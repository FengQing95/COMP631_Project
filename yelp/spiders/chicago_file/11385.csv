Art Institute of Chicago////The collection here was AMAZING. I was so excited about this. There were endless mazes after endless mazes of amazing works of art. David Hockney, Picasso, Miro, Dali, Magritte, Pollock, Matisse, Gaugin, O'Keefe, Degas, Monet, Manet, Van Gogh... It just goes on and on. Just when you think you're done seeing the best, there's more!
