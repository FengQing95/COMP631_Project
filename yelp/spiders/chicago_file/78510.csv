Little Goat Diner////Came to Little Goat for breakfast after a perhaps overly-indulgent night at Wrigley.  There may have been some mild hangover action happening.  Lovely patio seating helped, as did coffee and a mimosa. But more important was the Okonomiyaki (YUM).  Such a perfect, savory breakfast!  And perfect cure for those morning regrets!  Husband got the blueberry pancakes and BFF got the Paratha Burrito.  Clean plate club ruled.  And then we got to swing over to Sugargoat for some cookies for fuel later in the day.  What's not to love?
