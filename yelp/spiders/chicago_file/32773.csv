Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////But, then I got their dry aged bone-in ribeye.  I've been to steak places all over Chicago, and I have to say this was without a doubt the worst steak I've ever had since going to Sizzler in my college days.  Fatty, gristly, without any of the typical flavor that you would get from dry aging, just awful.  Their wine list also was very disappointing as the wines either were not good, or had such a large mark-up that is bounded on the ridiculous.  We also had the corn side, which was good.
