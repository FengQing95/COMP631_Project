Smoque BBQ////This place is amazing, and I'm from KC where there are tons of really good BBQ places. I had the brisket and it was very tender, well smoked, and the sauce selection is great. I'm also a huge fan of their sides, including their Mac and cheese and baked beans. This is my favorite place for BBQ in the city, I am always looking for an excuse to grab some Smoque.
