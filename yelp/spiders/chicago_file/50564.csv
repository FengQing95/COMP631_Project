Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////So while I'm as gringo as they come, I'm a huge fan of Spanish and Latin cuisine. My wife and I came here on a whim, a last minute thing. We went in and were seated promptly. The ambiance is beautiful with Spanish and abstract artwork throughout. Soft music and dim lights make even an ugly place seem nice but the decor is superb regardless.
