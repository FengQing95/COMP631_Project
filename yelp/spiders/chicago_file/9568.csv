Art Institute of Chicago////Then we went from classics to modern. The modern wing moved into modern architecture and had far more contemporary looking galleries. Downstairs we saw a photography exhibit that was stark and a little hard to follow. Upstairs we saw an architecture exhibit that showcased a photography technique to depict the urban decay of the city of Detroit and then showcased the buildings of Stanley Tigerman. I found this exhibit to be a bit disjointed. While I did not get to see the full extent of the modern art wing, I think this was potentially a weaker area of the museum.
