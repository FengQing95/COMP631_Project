The Purple Pig////The food was amazing! I ordered everything my server suggested and it was nothing short of delicious! The broccoli was the best broccoli you'll ever eat, the pig ear salad sounds a little scary if you've never eaten pig ear, but it was so crispy and yummy and the pork shoulder with mashed potatoes is really tender and creamy!
