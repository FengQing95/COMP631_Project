Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As far as pizzas go, this place is my all-time favorite.  While vacationing in Chicago recently, my parents and I happened on this place while taking in the city's sights.   After my dad spotted this restaurant across the street while we were taking a rest break, I was able to quickly review it on Yelp and realize this was a terrific dinner choice for that day.  True to Yelp's assessment, we all thoroughly enjoyed our meal there.  We were seated upstairs near the front of the restaurant (with views of the buildings across the street).  Because they cook each pizza per order submitted, it took about forty minutes before our Malnatti Chicago Classic Deep Dish Pizza (lean sausage, some extra cheese, & vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust) was brought to us.  While only a medium sized pizza, it was enough for my parents and me to share (although my mom did order something else as well).  Having only ever had a Chicago deep dish pizza once before (actually at Domino's here in Charleston - was really good), I was pleasantly surprised by just how delicious a true blue Chicago deep dish really is.  Having since tried two other famous Chicago restaurant deep dish pizzas while there (Giordano's and also Gino's East), my favorite is Lou's.  I highly recommend Lou's if you ever have the opportunity.  Their Malnati Salad is incredible too.  It consists of Romaine lettuce, tomatoes, black olives, mushrooms, Volpi salami bits, and gorgonzola cheese with their homemade Sweet Vinaigrette (fantastic) and side of romano cheese.  Absolutely amazing experience.  For those willing to try their pizzas from afar, Lou's ships their pizzas (frozen) across the country.  I'm actually planning on having some shipped here for my family and me later this year.
