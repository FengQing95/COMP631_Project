Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is a great place to go with a group of friends. Â We had quite a variety of tapas, but my absolute favorites were the patatas bravas (yummy!) and the seared scallops (mouth watering...) The sangria is fabulous, so much so, we had four pitchers :) I would definitely recommend this place!
