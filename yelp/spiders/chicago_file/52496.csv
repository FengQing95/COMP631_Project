Smoque BBQ////Brisket and pulled pork were good, but not amazing by any means.  The Mac and cheese was lumpy and flavorless, a big disappointment.  The sauce tasted like burnt, watered down tomato paste, definitely forgettable.  To top it all off, the cash register or POS system broke, once we placed our order they told us that we had to come back and get in line to pay after we finished our meal, totally inefficient.
