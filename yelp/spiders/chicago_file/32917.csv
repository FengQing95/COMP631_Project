Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We came here for my birthday & everything was fantastic. We were seated downstairs, which was nice because it was kind of removed & quiet. Â I really wanted a loaded baked potato, but saw one at the table next to us & decided against it because it was ridiculously large. Whiskey ice cream was also good.
