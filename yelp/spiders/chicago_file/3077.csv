The Purple Pig////We stopped into the Purple Pig on a Sunday night at about 6:30pm. There was a ton of people waiting outside, but perhaps they were waiting on larger parties because we managed to get seated right away! By the time we were leaving, I heard a couple ahead of me in line to use the restroom say their quoted wait time was 2.5 hours!
