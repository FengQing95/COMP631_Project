Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////very disappointed... ordered the chicken masala rigatoni... received bow tie pasta instead when I called to find out why I did not receive rigatoni and why I was not given the option of deciding whether or not I wanted bow tie pasta...I was told it tastes the same... in any case I should have been given the option to decide whether or not I wanted to change my order. The food was not good and the manager dismissive... will NEVER Â order from Lou Malnati's again and will not recommend it.
