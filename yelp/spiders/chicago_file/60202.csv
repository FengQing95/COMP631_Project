Smoque BBQ////Got to Smoque for the first time this week, and have to say it underwhelmed me more than I thought it would. I still liked the chopped brisket sandwich I got, but I would only get it a la carte next time, and skip getting it with slaw and 1 side($2 extra). The cole slaw was unfortunately the type that is drenched with too much vinegar(a la M Henry), and I really wished the mac and cheese was a slightly bigger portion.
