Art Institute of Chicago////Highlights: the colors in Van Gogh's self-portrait are stunning, Ivan Albright is a monster (in a good way), "Nighthawks" is way bigger than I imagined and "American Gothic" smaller, Italian armor is gorgeous, and we all enjoy feeling like Ferris Bueller when looking at Seurat (by far the most crowded work).
