Smoque BBQ////Anyways, we finally order then wait some more.  We take the food home as there was no where to sit.  The food was excellent.  Everything tasted awesome, right down to the sides.  Well worth the wait, but to avoid the wait, make sure you call your order in first, then it'll be ready for you when you get there.
