Art Institute of Chicago////It's hard to describe what the Art Institute really means to me. It's the home of great passions and emotions not only in the artists themselves but in the viewers like you and I. The Institute has also given me great memories, like from when I was a child and my father would take me on a Saturday morning, as a teenager going with friends for school or just fun, or even as an adult going on dates. Sometimes I even like to go there by myself with a pair of headphones and an open mind (you just have to watch where you walk, I've bumped into way too many people... then again, that's how I got a couple dates).
