Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////For my main tapas I tried the Spinach & Manchego Stuffed Mushrooms at $5.95. My favorite item of the night! They looked so good and tasted so very good! I was kind of sad my friends tried 2 so I was only left with 2 for myself. Selfish me. :P Â I also had the Chicken & Ham Croquetas at $5.95. These were so filling and I could barely finish them but they were just fantastic.
