Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Delicious Chicago style pizza. I was told to go here for damn-good Chicago pizza, and that is what we got. I was also told not to imagine it nor think of it like how I have always tasted and thought of pizza before. I was told this pizza would be a cheesy-ooey-gooey pie casserole, and that is what it was. With my altered expectations, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit.
