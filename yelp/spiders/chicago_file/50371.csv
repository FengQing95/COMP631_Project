Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////So I wanted to take my boyfriend out on his birthday. I called to make a reservation and I specifically told them that it was his birthday. I was excited because usually when it's a birthday you get a candle or something. I even went and spoke to my waiter during dinner to make sure that he received something on the desert that I paid for so that my boyfriend could feel special on his day. He said he knew and we went on with the night. Finally after dinner I had to ask for a desert menu as my waiter didn't even offer one. When we got our desert it was a tiny little thing and the waiter didn't even acknowledge the fact that it was my boyfriend's birthday! I was very disappointed! AFTER confirming twice that it was his birthday and getting confirmation they still whatevered my request! Definitely not going back there for any special occasion!
