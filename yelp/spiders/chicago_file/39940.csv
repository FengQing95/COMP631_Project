Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's has been on my bucket list for quite some time as it's been rated as one of the best steaks in Chicago. The last steakhouse I went to was Eddie Merlot's in Louisville and it was God awful. It was the worst steakhouse I have ever been to and I was craving a steak. So I came here right before a Bourbonfest at Untitled as I needed some food in my stomach. I arrived right at opening around 5:05pm on a Tuesday and noticed there were people already seated. I sat at the bar and saved a seat for my buddy. Lo and behold around 5:15pm all of the seats were taken and the bar was crowded from the work rush hour. The place was very dimly lit, fancy, and looked like a bigger Maude's Liquor Bar. Ironic since the restaurant group owns both places (along with Au Cheval) and they are all French. They also have a basement/speakeasy downstairs, which I did not explore.
