Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Had my first ever deep dish in chi town ... I was told this was a better location so I went here. I got your standard deep dish, nothing fancy. It was pretty darn good but I wouldn't go back if I wish in chi town again. Of course, when you're in Chicago you have to try a deep dish at least once. It didn't disappoint.
