The Purple Pig////Great place for unique and tasty modern tapas! The Purple Pig is located right on Michigan, the dining space is actually a bit smaller than expected but the interior is cozy and inviting, with the kitchen in full display. Came here with my girlfriend for an early valentine's day and had a delicious meal. Their menu is surprisingly varied, with cheese/charcuterie, a couple pastas, meat and seafoods, veggies, and even a section for offals (organs!). We decided in the crispy pig ear (apparently a popular item), the butternut squash, octopus cavatelli, and cuttlefish.
