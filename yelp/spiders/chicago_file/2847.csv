The Purple Pig////This place was packed on a Saturday night.  The hostess will text you when your table is ready so you can walk around while waiting or you can grab a drink.  As a party of two were were seated at a large table with other unfamiliar patrons.  It was a bit awkward sitting face to face with a stranger but when the place is packed I guess you have to sit wherever you can fit.
