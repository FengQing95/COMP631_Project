Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It's not cheap - I'm a firm believer that you get what you pay for. Â Look to pay around $3 ea for oysters, $14 for cocktails and wine, $45-70 for steaks and $10-14 for sides. I feel it was worth every penny in what ended up being as close to a perfect meal that I can remember.
