Little Goat Diner////Similar to a lot of the mediocre reviews on here, we found everything to be very salty. It was Sunday afternoon around 4:30pm and we had no problem getting a table immediately which was nice. My girlfriend and I had the patty melt (with beef) and the Korean burger (with goat) and split a side of fries. We both ordered medium rare, however, mine came out well done. The kimchi on my Korean burger was ridiculously salty. It made it very hard to enjoy or even taste the rest of the burger. My girlfriend's patty melt had pickles which were also too salty and took over the entire burger. Our mouthes were pretty raw by the time we tried to finish our burgers.
