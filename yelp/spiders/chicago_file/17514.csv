Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We came here twice during our vacation because it's that good! There is usually a line to get in but trust me, it's worth the wait! However, during the wait they ask that you place your order so that when you sit down your pizza will come out faster. One suggestion I could give the restaurant would be for them to incorporate text message wait line or call ahead seating.
