Smoque BBQ////This place is two blocks away from my house and I must say, it's worth all the accolades! Best BBQ in Chicago, Bar none! If you haven't had the Mac n cheese, please try it. And get your own, because you won't want to share it with anyone else. Also the Brisket is the best I've ever had. It's counter-service only and you might have to wait to place your order, but once you do, it's pretty smooth sailing to get a table and to wait for your food. As I've said here: BEST BBQ IN CHICAGO!
