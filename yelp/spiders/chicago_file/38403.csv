Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is run by Brendan Sodikoff's "Hogsalt" empire, and if you read my reviews, you know my love of all things Sodikoff is high (see: Cheval, Au). Thus, I went in expecting to love Bavette's, and came out loving Bavette's. Another thing to note about me is that my favorite steak is the one I grill at home. I'd rather spend $20 on a nice cut and blow on some charcoal than drop $60 in a white-linen, bow-tied establishment. The exception to that rule is steak frites. Yeah, give me a nice flat iron or skirt, grill it up real nice, throw it on a bed of fries and some aioli on the side. Winner winner, beefy dinner.
