Little Goat Diner////Terrible slow service by hipsters with attitudes that don't seem to care about anyone but themselves! First time there, in the area looking for a quick to go meal. It was Saturday 5pm, and I ordered a snack and lemonade to go from the bar by the bakery in back. Julia took my order and she never checked in with me again. I stood there for 30 minutes waiting for my order. Another bartender left my lemonade sitting behind the bar the whole time, uncovered, with the ice melting and diluting the drink. Julia never once gave me an update much less made eye contact. Finally, another guy arrived with my order. I asked a bartender for a lid for my drink, and in an unfriendly manner, he pointed to a corner and said, "They're over there!" Not a smile or thank you from anyone in that place. Will never go there again and I will tell friends to avoid the place because of bad service! My food was cold and average at best.
