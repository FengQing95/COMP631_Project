Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I absolutely love Tapas!! Â I find myself going to Tapas restaurants more than any other type of restaurant. I love small dishes. I love different takes on traditional Tapas and I love new inventive dishes (that probably by definition, are more of an appetizer than a Tapas dish).
