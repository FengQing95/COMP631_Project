Smoque BBQ////The is the best BBQ I've had in chicago.  I grew up traveling between Kansas City and Memphis a lot but as an adult I've also gained a taste for carolina gold and texas brisket.  Smoque is the only place that gets the meat perfect..in that texas brisket kind of way.  The chicken is also freaking delicious (How often do you say that about a BBQ joint)
