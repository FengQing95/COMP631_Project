Art Institute of Chicago////This was my first visit to the Art Institute. My review is skewed because I attended a special event instead of general admission. A new friend told me about the After Dark special event this past Friday night, and I was excited because it reminded me of First Friday events I had enjoyed in Seattle and Oakland, CA. The difference between After Dark and the First Friday events is that admission is charged and its more than just after-hours access to the museum exhibits. There's a party in the house!
