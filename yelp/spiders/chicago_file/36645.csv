Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bar none one of the best places ever. Ambiance-old speakeasy style. Chck (ask for a basement seat) Service. Check. Friendliness- check. Great steak, chicken & truffle mac. Check. And the thick cut bacon! When does bacon stop and a pork chop start. And the prices are reasonable. We had to make a reservation 6 weeks out. But it lived up to the hype which is so rare. Will def be back!
