Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place has raised the bar for Chicago dining. I came for dinner with my peep on a Saturday night and everything about our experience was perfect, from the moment we scored two comfie seats at the bar, to the second we walked out the door. Plus we could actually hear each other in the restaurant, which is becoming ever more rare these days. Service was fast and super friendly and the food from start to finish was delicious. We began with shrimp cocktail and complimentary sourdough bread. The bread was still warm and was served with tasty salted butter. We finished it all and were offered seconds, which was nice, even though we deferred. For entrees I went with the apple and pecan salad with aged parm and a side of the Elote Style Corn which was amazing and different from anything I had ever tasted. It was creamed with cheddar cheese and cilantro, and a hint of lime. The lime really added a kick. Both my friend and I loved it. The other standouts of the meal were my friend's filet and cream bernaise. The asparagus were largely ignored. We went with a few classic cocktails and those hit the spot as well. My only regret is that we did not order the whiskey ice cream. Next time!
