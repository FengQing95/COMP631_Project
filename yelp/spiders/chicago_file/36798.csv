Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I have lived in the city for 19 years, this was my first experience at a classic Chicago steakhouse, and I could not have been more pleased.  This is exactly how it should be, from the ambiance to the service to the quality of the food. Everything was delicious, the service was extremely skilled and professional, steak was absolutely perfect.
