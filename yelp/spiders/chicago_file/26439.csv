Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After sitting down for not even a minute our server promptly took our drink orders and gave us suggestions since it was our first time: Spinach bread and a "small" Classic sausage deep dish. Additionally, we had plates that were dirty, but the server took care of it. Another minor complaint: the two-person booths had really hard seats, it hurts after a while. Maybe it's a sign that I need to workout more for a bigger booty.
