Little Goat Diner////The service was fantastic. Every other dish we saw coming out of the kitchen in front of us looked delectable. We wanted to try everything! Oh and we asked to steal two of their Goat logo stickers, so I stuck mine on the receipt to save it in the travel scrapbook. That's how much I love this place.
