Art Institute of Chicago//// Â  There's galleries and galleries here with art of all styles from all regions of the world here, just like a big league art museum should have. I thought I had squeezed in the last couple rooms just before closing, only to find there was still a couple more I couldn't fit in. It sure would be nice if AIC could stay open later, but if I ever find myself in the Windy City again I should probably just get here a little earlier.
