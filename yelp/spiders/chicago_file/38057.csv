Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is my favorite special occasion restaurant. I don't eat meat, which may sound weird that I love this steak house, but there's so many non-meat Â delicious dishes on the menu to try. Wedge salad! Shrimp cocktail! Seafood tower! Crab avacado! And the bread... Oh the bread! Little known fact, despite the fact that there is a a full bar, you may bring in one bottle of wine per group. The wait person will open the bittke for you, no corkage fee, but will give away one glass of your wine to another table. Great little perk!
