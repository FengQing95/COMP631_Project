Smoque BBQ////I read about this place and was looking forward to eating here. I was not disappointed. I tried the ribs, pulled pork, and brisket. All were amazing with the brisket being the best I've ever had. The beans and slaw were excellent as well. There's street parking but you may have to go around a few times before finding a spot but it's well worth it. I can't wait to visit Chicago again and go back to this wonderful place.
