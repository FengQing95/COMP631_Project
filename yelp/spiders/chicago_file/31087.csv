Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Service was rapid and incredibly friend. The pizza was different than Giordano's, as it has more of a sauce on top layout to their pizza where Giordano's is more encapsulated. I got the sausage pizza (forget the formal name, but the famous one), and REALLY good. The sauce is complex and it compliments well with the meatiness. The crust was dense but flakey and well seasoned (Giordano's is dense like chicken pot pie, not as good). For starters, we got the bruschetta which had a lovely presentation and had fresh ingredients which sometimes you don't see.
