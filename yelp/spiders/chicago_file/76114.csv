Little Goat Diner////Make a reservation. I don't care which meal you're going for because this place is so popular. I made reservation at 11:45am on a Sunday and got seated immediately. The interior of the restaurant is like a hybrid between a traditional diner and a modern chic restaurant - well-lit, crowded, but comfortable. I got That Little Piggy Went To China and the Bull's Eye French Toast. Buttery, soft sesame biscuit, oozy yolk from the fried egg, finished with a spicy kick from the chili oil, the little-piggy dish is definitely playing a different game than your traditional biscuits and sausage breakfast plate. The french toast was pretty mind-blowing as well: thick-cut sweet onion brioche bread, with two eggs cracked in the middle, drizzled with maple syrup and topped with chunks of fried chicken - it's savory and sweet that hypothetically won't work, but realistically a delicious party in your mouth.
