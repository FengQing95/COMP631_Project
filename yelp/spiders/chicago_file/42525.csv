Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Their house sangria is great and the servers have always given me good suggestions. Very gracious about any special requests you have. Was very impressed with our service when we had an awkward situation arise. We were halfway through one of our tapas and a small bug flew in to the sauce and got stuck. Clearly we weren't going to eat it, so we told the server he could take it. He was very apologetic, and we laughed it off because clearly it wasn't the restaurants fault a bug wanted our food as much as we did. We were surprised to see it was taken off of our bill even though we had eaten half of it and hadn't complained at all.
