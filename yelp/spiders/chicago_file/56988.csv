Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here for brunch with friends that were in town during restaurant week and once again our experience here was great! The only thing is it's always so busy here so we weren't seated right away at the time of our reservation and had to wait ~15 minutes. Other than that we ordered from the restaurant week menu so it was $24 for brunch and you get a drink (red or white sangria, mimosa, or a trip to the blood Mary bar), then you get to pick from 2 courses, and a dessert tapa. Everything was delicious as always. I got the bacon Mac n cheese, shrimp & grits, and chocolate truffle cake. For brunch, I recommend getting the Spanish Cubano bocadillo, it's braised pork shoulder and aioli on an English muffin - very flavorful! The shrimp and grits were good, but the grits could use just a little more flavor. The bacon Mac n cheese with a poached egg was also pretty good. For tapas, my top 3 favorite and ones I recommend the most are the scallops, goat cheese, and spicy potatoes, you will not be disappointed!
