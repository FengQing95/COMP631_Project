Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The queue can look intimidating for this River North Lou Malanti's, but it's a huge place with 2 floors so the wait isn't bad. My friend and I waited for ~20 minutes. However after we ordered, I don't know if they're understaffed or what, but it took almost an hour for our food to come. We didn't even get anything crazy. Just 2 personal pies - the Malnati Chicago classic and the "lou."
