Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came here solo while in town on business.  I came on a Thursday evening.  I sat at the bar.  Nice little section with TVs and comfortable barstools.  I ordered a beer and a pizza.  A medium for myself, deep dish, the "original".  Absolutely delicious.  Will come back next time I'm in town.
