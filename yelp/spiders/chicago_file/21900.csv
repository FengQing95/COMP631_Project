Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Apart from the amazing pizza and the pretty amazing sides, I have to comment on the stellar customer service I received today at Lou's. Gloria our server found out that I had just moved to Chicago and went out of her way to bring me a CTA map and show me how to navigate it.
