Art Institute of Chicago//// Â  I really wanted my hometown Detroit Institute of Arts to outshine this museum and was constantly comparing the two which was pretty unnecessary as they're both easily five star world class museums. The collection at the AIC is a bit better but where the DIA beats it is the massive Diego Rivera murals in the center court. I was also patting my hometown museum on the back for its outdoor sculptures, thinking AIC had none. Then I left out on a different side of the building to discover AIC had sculptures after all. D'oh! DIA has AIC beat on admission fee, but things in Chicago just cost more. Enough of that game, though. If you're into art at all, both museums are must visits if you're in either respective city.
