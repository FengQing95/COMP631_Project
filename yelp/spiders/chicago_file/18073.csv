Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've eaten here a few times and the pizza is ok.  Unfortunately, I'm also a neighbor and have asked them repeatedly to stop having their grease-pit truck (Mahoney) from pumping so early in the morning.  The noise lasts for an hour and sounds like a train outside our windows.  They've said they would postpone to later in the day, but that lasts for a few weeks and then returns.  I bet the CEOs at Mahoneys and Manalti's would be up in arms if I blew my horn outside their houses while they were still sleeping, but they are so inconsiderate of others.  Keep this in mind while you're eating.
