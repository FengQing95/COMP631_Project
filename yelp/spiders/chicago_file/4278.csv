The Purple Pig////Don't let the fact that they don't take reservations drive you away.  A 20 minute wait was easy with a great selection of wines by the glass. The plates are  a great size for sharing multiple things. So...the roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachio butter was a great start. The foi gras and brioche ice  cream , raspberry jelly and pistachio butter was a perfect match of decadence and cool decadence.  The lamb ribs were fall off the bone delicious. And the pork belly and tenderloin was a perfect pairing.
