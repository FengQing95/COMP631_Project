Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Good raspberry sangria and some red wines.  Love the goat cheese tapa with tomato sauce and garlic bread.  The chicken empanada is good and so is the Spanish omelette (tortilla Espanola).  The stuffed mushrooms were just ok.  The fried calamari was good but spicy.  Some of the tapas had too much sauce, but otherwise most of the food is good.  Overall a fun time with a group of friends in a lively place.
