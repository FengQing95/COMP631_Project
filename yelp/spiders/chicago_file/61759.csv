Smoque BBQ////Smoque has pretty decent food. The grilled chicken was moist and had good flavor with a nice skin, the ribs, both styles, were nicely smoked with a nice rub seasoning but unfortunately, the brisket, with the exception of the first piece which was hot, nicely fatted and flavorful, was a bit dry. That all being said, this is probably the best smoked meat bbq I've found in Illinois, home of the 'goopy', overcooked rib eater. Service was efficient. The facility is small and not too much to get excited about. I have sat inside and out and if the weather is accommodating, out is much better.
