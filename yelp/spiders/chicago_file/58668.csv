Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Wonderful dinning experience here. Made dine in reservations and was able to sit in the bar area. Happy hour specials only available at the bar area. Service was quick and portions were expertly priced. Was able to try over 6 dishes for a reasonable amount. Potatoes were seasoned perfectly and paired well with the aioli. Wagyu Beef melts in your mouth. Soft burrata bread with hits of spicy from the peppers made this dish. Couldn't beat the beer and sangria prices for happy hour. Will definitely be coming back in the near future.
