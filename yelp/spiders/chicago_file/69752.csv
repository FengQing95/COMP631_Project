Little Goat Diner////This would be a great place to sit, drink, and snack.  Unfortunately, there are no tables, there are relatively few seats at the counter, and the space doubles as a waiting area for LG next door.  There only were maybe 30 customers in there when I arrived, yet every seat was taken and the rest of the folks were struggling to find a polite place to stand.  This issue arises only because the space is surprisingly narrow.  I can't imagine how uncomfortable it must be when it's actually crowded.
