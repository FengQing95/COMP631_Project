Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Classic chicago deep dish pizza with their infamous butter crust.  They actually sell their pizza online so if you dont live in chicago, you'll be able to enjoy their pizza anyway.  That being said, Ive tried both the frozen kind and the one at the restaurant.  Surprisingly pretty close in terms of taste.  I would say the tomato and the cheese were the biggest difference from restaurant to home delivery.  The tomatoes were so fresh and the cheese gooyie-er.  The crust was pretty much the same.  All in all a good pizza, but still doesnt come close to the best in NYC.
