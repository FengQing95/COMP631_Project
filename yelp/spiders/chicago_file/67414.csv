Little Goat Diner////My friend asked for a recommendation and had a few questions on the menu and Joanie was really helpful in answering our questions. I opted for the Simple Goat (it's not on the main menu but listed on a tent card on the table to the side). This dish had your choice of eggs (I got scrambled), bacon, a crazy serving of hash browns, and a choice of biscuit or toast (of course opted for the biscuit). My friend ordered the sourdough pancakes and questioned the grits. She's originally from South Carolina and she knows her grits. Me on the other hand being a native New Yorker knows absolutely nothing about good grits! So I could respect her interrogation of how they are prepared and what good grits really are. She opted to try them and said they were the best she's ever had! My friend even scraped every last bit with her spoon. They were that good. So get the grits - they are Southerner approved!!! :) She also liked her sourdough pancakes. My breakfast was really good as well and I recommend the Simple Goat and right now I'm craving the bacon!!!!!! On my return trip to Chicago, I plan on taking my husband here because first of all he's referred to as "Goat Boy" (he used to have a long goatee) and I know he would really appreciate the wholesome tasty food that Stephanie Izard has put together.
