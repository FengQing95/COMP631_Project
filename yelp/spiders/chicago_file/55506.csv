Smoque BBQ////Being from the south I am  very picky about BBQ. After seeeing this place on Food network and seeing the great reviews I just had to try it. Let me tell you the food is some of the best BBQ I've ever had!!! Trust me you will not be disappointed. My only complaint is the place is a little small.  Not able to really enjoy this awesome food when you are sitting 15 inches from a complete stranger.
