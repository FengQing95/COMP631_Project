Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Next, stand in line to place your order with the cashiers (soft drinks, water & second round of beers will be ordered from your table server). They encourage you to do this since they are very busy and by time (20mins or so) your table is ready, so will your food. As you are waiting, order a beer, they will also provide you with a fresh baked thin crust pizza as free apps. Probably to suppress the appetites of a happy mob before they morph into an angry one :)
