Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Really fun for groups! So far, this has the best tapas atmosphere for a group of the places that I have seen for the price...and the sangria is really good too.  They have a variety of sangria options(7 in all), I really like the passion fruit flavor...Emilio's has better food though. The food is decent, but there are better tapas places for food if there are only a couple of you.  If you do eat here, save room for dessert i love the Spanish "Bull's Eyes"...it is sorbet topped with complimentary liquor...sounds odd but taste really good.
