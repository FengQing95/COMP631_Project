The Purple Pig////Was visiting Chicago, my favorite City, for a Bachelorette weekend. Amongst the funfilled events of complete debauchery I had to carve out sometime to eat at a resturant I've wanted to eat at for sometime now but have never had the chance during my former business trips to ChiTown.
