The Purple Pig////Great customer service! COVID protocols are in place. Staff and patrons are wearing masks. Waitress was sensitive to my alleges. Gave me of menu of what I could have without onions. Very warm and welcoming. Went here for a drink and lunch. Many different options. Definitely try this spot.
