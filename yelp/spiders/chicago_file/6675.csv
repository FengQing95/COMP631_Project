The Purple Pig////- poached pork belly & lobster (special item): I'm so glad we caught this on the menu, as this was one of my favorite dishes here. The pork was SO GOOD though. The skin is caramalized into a thick, crispy layer. Sweet and such a good crunch factor. And the pork belly was so soft and juicy! Went well with the big lobster pieces on top! Beautiful presentation, as well!
