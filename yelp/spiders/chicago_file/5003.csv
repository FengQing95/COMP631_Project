The Purple Pig////Reason for the 4 star: It's a small location. I felt cold because the door kept opening and closing. I know it's Chicago and to deal with it, but it got a little out of hand and made it uncomfortable for the second half of our dinner. The host was not as friendly and made it seem like us coming a little after 10pm as bad.
