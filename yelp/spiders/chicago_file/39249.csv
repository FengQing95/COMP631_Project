Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For dinner my wife ordered filet mignon and I had the dry aged ribeye.  I liked the ribeye. The wife found that her filet was too fatty. She pointed out that a filet should not have inedible gristle/fat running through it.  A filet is supposed to be lean and this one was not.  It was also served cold. I had a similar issue with too much fat, but accept that it happens frequently that half of a ribeye is fat.
