Smoque BBQ////Now, for the bad.  The brisket, while cooked perfectly, was under-seasoned.  The pulled pork and ribs were very disappointing: both were severely dry.  My girlfriend almost choked on the pulled pork because it was so difficult to swallow.  Both the pulled pork and the ribs were a far cry from the best that I've ever had.
