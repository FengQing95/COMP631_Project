The Purple Pig////Overall, the meal was lovely. Prices were reasonable and portions, actually quite hefty. I wished I lived in the city--if i did, I would come back all the time. Unfortunately, I'm 5 hours away by plane. If you're traveling and making a stop in Chicago, you definitely need to give this place a try.
