Little Goat Diner////Have grabbed take out many times from the Diner and appreciate the Grab N Goat cooler where sammies and salads are pre made and ready for pick up. When the roast beef Sammie and kale salad weren't available today, was annoyed when I was told that they couldn't be made to order. I could order more expensive versions from the bar and wait for them. Understand how busy they are, still enjoy the food, but disappointed with the customer service today.
