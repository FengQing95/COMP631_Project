Smoque BBQ////I love that this place follows the rule of  "Nothing to Hide, Sauce on the Side" and they do it well. I will admit, the portions of the sides (cornbread instead of slaw and mac & cheese) were small but tasted really good, and the fries were good & plenty of them.  BYOB - love it!  Can't wait to try their sandwiches!
