Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Look, usually I don't care about service that much. But for a place like this, hmm. I don't need you to kiss my a$$ but when I am out to dinner with someone paying $100-200 for my night, I am really going to need your snottiness to take it down a notch. I mean, she wasn't exactly rude, but she wasn't exactly a doll either. It was as if she was a mother-in-law totally disinterested in her husband's children. The service was well-timed, but not very friendly. Even before we were seated, the hostess was pretty rude to anybody who came in without a reservation.
