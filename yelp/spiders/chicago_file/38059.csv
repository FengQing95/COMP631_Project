Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////First thing's first, know that you are allowed to bring your own bottle of wine.  Their policy as far as the corkage fee is that you send a glass of your wine over to another table.  Small price to pay!  On our last visit (for our wedding anniversary) we sent a glass to an older couple.  They were kind enough to even send us a glass of their lovely cab!
