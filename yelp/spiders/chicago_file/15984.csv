Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We are seated and I mention I have a tab at the bar... and then she says, rather rudely "You'll have to close that out." So she expected me to go downstairs to the bar to do that. Fine, I thought, I'll do it when we are leaving. Then the waiter comes and asks if we want drinks. But then he tells us that he can't serve us until we go and close out our tab at the bar! Which is outrageous. Why didn't they ask or inform us before we went upstairs with our drink. Why couldn't one of them have brought us the bill and my card? Why after making us wait for our table, would they make a customer go down to the bar, stand and wait for the bartender to get us our bill?
