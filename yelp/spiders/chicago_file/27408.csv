Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First try of Chicago Style pizza .. since moving here.  We are afraid trying something new.    We had the bruschetta ..  its amazing .  The pizza was even better!   The preparation took 45 min.  The wait was worth it!   The crust is buttery yet crispy.  The service was amazing , the wait staff and waiter was there when needed but not too much..   Plan for wait if you get there too late in the day.
