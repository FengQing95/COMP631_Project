Little Goat Diner////Visited Saturday 10/ 4/14,  afternoon about 2:30 PM. The food, as anticipated, was awesome. Can't go wrong with the pig in a blanket, actually goat sausage in a blanket.  My fifth star goes to the staff.  Our server, Andrea, I hope i remebered the correct name, inked arms, was fantastic.  Our hostess was very engaging and took good care of our group of 5.  Great staff made my first trip there a great experience.  Can't wait to go back and to also recommend it to friends.
