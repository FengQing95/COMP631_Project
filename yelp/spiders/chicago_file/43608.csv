Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I leave off one star because I have two minuses.  The first was the wait time.  I made a 7pm reservation 2+ weeks ago for dinner in celebration of my birthday.  We were told that things were running behind, and we didn't get seated until 7:32pm.  If that were my restaurant, I would've comped the table a pitcher of sangria or something.  I realize it's not their fault that diners linger, but how about some customer service?  A lot of restaurants apologize for making you wait for your reservation and try to make it up to you.  Everyone's reservations were pushed back - it was not an ideal situation.  The restaurant should've bucked up and tried to show some hospitality for making people wait like that.  Just a token would've been nice - free sodas?  A plate of spicy potatoes?  Something.  You know people would've been impressed/pleased and raved about the restaurant as a result.
