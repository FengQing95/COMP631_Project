Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////After making a reservation via Opentable, I needed to call them and add another guest onto the reservation.  The person who answered made me feel dumb bc I didn't know the difference between the parlor and the upstairs dining area.  That aside, I am glad we were seated downstairs in the parlor because it oozed sexiness.
