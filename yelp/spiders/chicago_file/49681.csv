Smoque BBQ////as for sides: if i had my way the mac and cheese would be 3x as big, because its just that good, the sauce is creamy and the crispy crust.. oh yea. the baked beans are sweet with great chunks of tender pork, the corn bread is a nice side for the meats..cole slaw comes with all the platters, the dressing is light and acidic and has a nice crunch, but i hate the celery seeds (! personal issue). the fries have their moments, some stronger than others.. but i feel a bit too greasy after eating all the meat and fries. peach cobbler is a nice way to finish it all off, but really i just want more mac and cheese :)
