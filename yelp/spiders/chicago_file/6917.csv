Art Institute of Chicago////I'm sure if you are into art you will love this place. If you don't, it still has al ot to appreciate. To be honest, I've never gone here because I wanted to, other then I didn't want to be left behind on a field trip day. There is a wide variety of paintings, sculptures, and misc. "art" to see. It would be a great date idea if you want to look sophisticated.
