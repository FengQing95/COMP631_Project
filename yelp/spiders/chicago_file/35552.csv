Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The ambiance was very nice (I'd also say intimate). We decided to sit at the bar and the service there was excellent, everyone from the hosts and hostess to the two bartenders to the wait staff were very warm, professional, and invested in making sure my mom and I had a wonderful evening (which obviously we did).
