Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Sadly, I do not live in Chicago so I may never return here again.  I must continue my deep dish tour and check out another place the next time I'm in town.  I will say though, that compared to Gino's, Lou Malnati's is far superior.  Gino's has a great feel to it, but the food just doesn't compare.  For those that are able to get to Lou Malnati's whenever they want, I can't stress enough how great it is.
