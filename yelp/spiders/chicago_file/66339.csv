Little Goat Diner////I like the fact that they have a separate gluten free menu, but that's about it. I ordered the GF pancakes and cheesy grits. The pancakes were decent. The grits were not good at all. They were not consistently cooked throughout, as if they had not been stirred while they were cooking and overall were undercooked.
