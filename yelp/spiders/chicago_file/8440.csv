Art Institute of Chicago////The first time I came here in 2007, they had a special exhibit called Cézanne to Picasso: Ambroise Vollard, Patron of the Avant-Garde. I was in heaven. I enjoy Cézanne's work along with Picasso, so it was great. On my recent visit, I went straight to the Impressionism and Post-Impresionism gallery where they have Monet, Van Gogh, Cézanne, Renoir, and Seurat. My two favorite paintings were Renoir's Two Sisters and Seurat's A Sunday on La Grande Jatte. Because I was pressed for time, I checked out the American Gothic painting and the Buddha statue. In the museum guide, it gives you a must-see list if you don't have time to browse through all of their galleries. You can spend days here and still not see everything.
