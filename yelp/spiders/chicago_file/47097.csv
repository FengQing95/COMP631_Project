Smoque BBQ////Waited in line, place was packed, order full rack of st. louis and baby back ribs mac n cheese cole slaw, corn bread, pulled pork, and fries. Shared all this with two friends. The bbq was good, but I will begin my review by saying I am more of a wet bbq than dry bbq fan when it comes to ribs meaning I like my ribs covered in bbq sauce while still being cooked. These ribs had an extremely smokey flavor which if you like is good. The dry rub left me so parched that I was chugging water well into the night. Mac n cheese was ok, but wouldn't say it was out of this world. Corn bread was okay but I like my corn bread sweeter. Fries were good but pretty plain. Pulled pork was good but a touch dry. Cole slaw was interesting and vinegar-y. BBQ sauce was good but i like having a choice of different sauces. Smoque is good but I wont wait in line for it again and fight the crowds to get a table. I think there are other better options in Chicago.
