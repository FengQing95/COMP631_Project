Little Goat Diner////It's VERY nice that they offer a vegan menu, even though it is super limited. At least it's a nod to the fact that we aren't all carnivores. However, if Stephanie Izard put the same skill and creativity into the vegan menu that she put into the regular menu, it would be f'ing amazing, I'm sure.
