Little Goat Diner////The sandwiches however were excellent. Crispy yet buttery soft bread, quality ingredients with tons of flavor, and heavenly melted cheese. The only complaint being from my husband who hoped the goat would've had a more distinct taste. He said that had he not known, he would have simply thought it was beef.
