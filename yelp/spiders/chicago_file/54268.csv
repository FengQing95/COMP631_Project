Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I was a little skeptical about this place with their small plate serving that are shared family style. Once we did order our first round it was well worth it. We ordered a mix of things but the octopus dish stood out. It was not chewy at all but soft and tasty. It w not really well with the scallops also. I didn't get a chance to taste the white sangria as everyone at the table drank that first so I only was able to drink the red one. Red was good as a had more then half to my self.
