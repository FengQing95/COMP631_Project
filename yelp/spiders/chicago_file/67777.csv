Little Goat Diner////There was a food and wine article stating this place had some of the best fried chicken in America.  My hotel was only a mile away so of course I had to try it.  We ordered a loaded French fry dish, the Los drowned sandwich with a side of cheddar sausage and the fried chicken platter with a biscuit.  First of all the service was great, the place was charming and everything seemed very high quality.  Unfortunately the food was hit and miss.  The loaded French fries were tasty, crispy and piled high with fixings.  The sandwich was serviceable but not memorable.  And last and least the $22 three piece fried chicken was oh so hugely disappointing.  After one bite, all the coating just fell off leaving me with naked chicken with soggy skin......Soggy Frickin Skin.  To its credit, the breast meat was moist with a tang, perhaps from buttermilk.  But I didn't order plain whatever chicken, I ordered fried mother fricken chicken and that was not it.   The side mashed potatoes were creamy and rich, the gravy was just ok (very salty), the cole slaw was refreshing and the biscuit was fantastic; buttery and flaky.  Also the two (hot, super hot) house made hot sauces were truly salvations.  They were fiery and fruity and full of flavor.  They made everything taste better.  So maybe I just ordered wrong.  If I get another chance I would go back and order something else.  I partially blame Food & Wine magazine for this fried chicken misadventure.  They got it wrong, big time.
