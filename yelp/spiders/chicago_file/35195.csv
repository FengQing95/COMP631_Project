Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Tried this place with the hubs on a recent trip to Chicago. It was excellent from start to finish!! We shared: Â peppered duck & goat cheese terrine (so good - that mustard goes well with it), wedge salad (with seriously the best thick-cut bacon I've ever had), side of wild mushrooms (very flavorful), and bone-in filet (cooked perfectly medium rare) with addition of a couple roasted bone marrow (rich and umami). Drinks were very good and service was impeccable! Small place and very dimly lit, which I didn't mind. I loved the ambiance, especially being with my husband. It's what I imagine old Chicago to be like. Would definitely come here again next time in Chi-town.
