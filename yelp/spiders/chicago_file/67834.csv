Little Goat Diner////We got there about 6:30 to put our name in. Conveniently, they take your name and number and text you when they are ready. They are great bars all around to get drinks while waiting! They said it would be a 60-75 minute wait which was no problem since we planned to hang out at Haymarket. Little did we know, our table was ready much sooner, but there was a text messaging issue so we finally walked over after 75 minutes. They felt so bad we had the next available table with complimentary gluten free nachos!
