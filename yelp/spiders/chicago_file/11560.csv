Art Institute of Chicago////There are a ton of wonderful exhibits, and a lot to see. I loved the stained glass (I think it's Chigals stained glass exhibit), the china exhibit and the American Art section. Â They also have two gift shops available, where you can purchase a lot of good stuff. The gift shops can be pricey, but I found a few things here that I liked, all for under $10.
