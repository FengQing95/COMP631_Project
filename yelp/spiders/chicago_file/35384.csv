Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The inside is sexy as ever which really made the night. My hosts are some of my favorite people on Earth so that made the night as well. If a person brought me there because it was their favorite restaurant for a first date, I would probably not go out with that person again. Well maybe one more time to see what else they have up their sleeve - another pretentious Chicago restaurant that takes forever to get a reservation? THEN we'll never see each other again. Three stars for the ambiance and the great luck they had on my steak....and my company made up for the rest. Thanks.
