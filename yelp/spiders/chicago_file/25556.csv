Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Now while I would never consider this "pizza," (in NY they serve actual pizza) the quiche I had was wonderful. The crust was crisp, sauce and toppings (?) sandwiched in between were delectable as well. Also had their signature salad, which was fantastic. I'm not sure why people from Chicago have this inferiority complex when it comes to the quiches they serve, but trying to compare it to NY pizza is just plain wrong. That said, it was delicious!
