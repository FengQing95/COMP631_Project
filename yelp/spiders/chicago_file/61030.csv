Smoque BBQ////To preface: We are not food snobs at all. All we want is good food, good service, and a pleasant experience. We go out to eat several times a week and try to judge everything fairly, within context, and with an open-mind. I say this only because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews of this place that I do not get at ALL.
