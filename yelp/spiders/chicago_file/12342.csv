Art Institute of Chicago////As I said this has to be one of the best art museums in the country. I was in there for three or four hours and I still didn't have time to see it all. I would certainly recommend this museum to anyone visiting Chicago. I took the train into downtown last weekend but noticed traffic was light so I think maybe during the pandemic driving is more manageable than usual
