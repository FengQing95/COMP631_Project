Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went here for happy hour with my girlfriend a few nights ago. Ordered a beer before she got there, then we shared a pitcher of red sangria. Ordered a few pinxos and tapas, everything was quite good. Left for a very reasonable price and felt comfortably full and content from the sangria. The only reason I can't give five stars is due to a post dining customer service reason. I left my sunglasses at the bar and realized later that night that I had not picked them up. Being a few miles away already without a car, I decided to wait until the morning to call for them. The next morning I called shortly after they opened. I was told they were very busy and to call back. I thought this was fine, I'd rather have them be honest then just pretend to look. Calling later on during the later afternoon I was greeted with a similar response, but this time I said I'd wait on hold until they had a chance to look. Not 40 seconds later I was told they didn't have them and they were sorry. Maybe they looked, maybe they didn't. Either way I retraced all my steps and that was the only logical place for the sun glasses to be. The knock is for potential employee honesty issues, other than that keep doing what you're doing. I'm sure it was just one bad egg that decided to swipe them.
