The Purple Pig////We followed that with there special of the day, buffalo mozzarella, meatballs, a bone marrow dish, fried pig ears?!? And many more(check out my photos!) the service was very attentive and professional. Great recommendations and explanations of how they do things and what too expect. The lines for the restroom was pretty ridiculous so I would recommend stopping by somewhere public before coming in to eat or else you'll be waiting and missing out on all the food, the plates come out pretty quickly!
