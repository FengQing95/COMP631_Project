Little Goat Diner////This was our second time trying Little Goat - first time wasn't amazing and we wanted to give it another try.  We thought the first time maybe we ordered the wrong thing so were more adventurous in our ordering.  I had the fish tostadas which were a "4" and my husband had a goat burger which wasn't anything special for $14, especially when you have to order the fries alacarte.  The service was not good, after taking our order our server disappeared - the food runners interacted with us more than he did and then it took 20 min to get our check after our plates were cleared - unacceptable.  He was probably disappointed with the tip, but he wasn't good.  Tried it twice, unfortunately won't be back :(
