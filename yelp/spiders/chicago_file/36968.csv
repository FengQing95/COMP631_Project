Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place has it all! I've recommended every guest and friend to Bavette's and they've all enjoyed the food, drinks, and ambiance (at least that's what I've been told). Â I don't eat steak often, but have been to many of the top rated steakhouses in Chicago, compared with Kinzie Chop House, David Burke's, Fulton's on the River, and Gibsons, Bavette's has the most flavorful and tenderest meat there is. Ordered the Prime bone in Ribeye, which was cooked to perfection; you can taste the fresh meat and spice in every bite. The salt seasoning that came with it on the side was heaven. It really put the masterpiece together. The sides were scrumptious, especially the chili, lime corn and buttery mashed potatoes, YUM! Service was very friendly and professional.
