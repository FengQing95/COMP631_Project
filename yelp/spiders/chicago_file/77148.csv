Little Goat Diner////The reason I am posting this many stars is because of the service we received during our lunch here. When we first arrived the hostess said that we couldn't get a booth. Unless we waited another 30 minutes to be seated. The employees also seemed very stressed and it did not appear to have a good work environment. To a level where our waitress disappeared for at least 20 mins and came back with tears in her eyes. Her co-workers were complaining about her being gone and didn't seem supportive, sadly.
