Little Goat Diner////Atmosphere is really laid back and you can expect every dish to have it's own unique little twist. I got the Brandade & Belly (brandade, pork belly, kimchi, 2 sunny side up eggs) and it was pretty tasty. I would definitely come back to try their other dishes; I like to look at other tables to see what other people get (lol) and everything I saw looked really darn good. My roommate got the Kimchi & Eggs & Bacon & Pancakes-- (the pancake is like the asian scallion pancakes-- not made with the usual pancake batter you might expect) and she really liked the flavor and texture of the dish. My friend got the Bulls-Eye French Toast (french toast, berries, fried chicken, a sunny side up egg, bbq maple syrup, and powdered sugar) and he was a huge fan.
