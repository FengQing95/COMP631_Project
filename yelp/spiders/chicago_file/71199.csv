Little Goat Diner////Great spot for Sunday brunch. We had a small wait but nothing to major. Once again we all shared 4 different meals. At the table we had a Cuban sandwich with two sunny side up eggs on top, bullseye French toast, spiced apple pancakes and the parathas burrito. I would recommend each dish to anyone. They were all delicious and unique. Great flavors and they were all presented very nicely.
