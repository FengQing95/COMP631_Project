Art Institute of Chicago////The first time I went to the Art Institute (for some reason) I kept on comparing the building and the interior design with the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Probably because I was so impressed with MOMA I kept looking for the same experience. However, the Art Institute has a more "comfortable" feeling. It is cozier and feels like you can come here every day. The map can easily guide you to all the important exhibitions. My favorite pieces are the "American gothic" by Grant Wood and the "Picture of Dorian Gray" by Ivan Albright. It is great that they have free days for the citizens of Illinois or Bank of America customers. I do wish that they will update the collections a little more often as long as they keep my two favorite paintings. Â Other than that - a great museum!
