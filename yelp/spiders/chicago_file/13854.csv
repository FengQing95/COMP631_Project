Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After reading reviews on Yelp and seeing where the stars like to eat, we decided on this place. I was looking forward to having really Chicago style deep dish. We got there before the crowd. and ordered the signature salad and pizza. The salad was HANDS DOWN THE BEST. the house made sweet vinaigrette was so deliciously tasty and mouth watering that I couldn't wait to try the pizza (you can buy the dressing in a bottle!). The pizza came after about 40 mins. it looked tasty and gooey. But I was disappointed from the first bite. The house made lean sausage was terrible. it had not flavor and didn't bring anything to the pizza. The cheese was way to thick (who says that!). It was like eating a mozzarella cheese stick, not the business on pizza. and the tomatoes on the top was a very thin coat that also lacked in flavor. No amount of salt or parmesan cheese was going to make this pizza better. Â The whole table was truly disappointed with this pizza. The only reason this place got 1 star was the salad which I wish I could have more. We wont be coming back.......
