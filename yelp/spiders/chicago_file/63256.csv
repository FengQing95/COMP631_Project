Smoque BBQ////The popularity of this place has died down some over the years, which is a good thing.  Used to be a line out the door at all times.  Now, you walk right on in.  If you are planning to eat in tho, they dont have many tables and if crowded, you will sit with strangers - think Amtrak dining car.
