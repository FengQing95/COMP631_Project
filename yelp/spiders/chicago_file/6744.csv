Art Institute of Chicago////Place was awesome! A beautiful museum with a pretty cool collection. It's definitely not as big as the Met in NYC, but it gets the job done, especially if you don't want to spend the entire day in a museum (or you're with a sister who keeps bitching at you to go eat Giardano's). I got a ticket with the chicago trolley package and student ID, so it was only 10 bucks to get in.
