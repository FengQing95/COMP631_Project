Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Definitely the Lou and Malnati namesake pizzas are the way to go.  Delicious, cheesy, and filling.  My only complaint aside from the wait was that I'm not a huge fan of the crust.  It's very... crusty.  It's a bit hard - not soft, yet crispy as I like.  But to each, his own.  Still a definitely great place!
