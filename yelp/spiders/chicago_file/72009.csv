Little Goat Diner//// I had the delicious goat patty melt!  OMG! i have been thinking about this darned sandwich since I have eaten here!  CHEESY OL MIGHTY. As an attempt to plea with my lactose-intolerance, I had the dairy-free chocolate shake.  I would have taken pictures, but I ate it!  I devoured it, and I didnt want to wait.  What a treat!  We will be back!
