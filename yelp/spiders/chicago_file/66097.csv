Smoque BBQ////For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can't go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn't tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I'd choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!
