Smoque BBQ////Definitely overrated to say the least. I've had some decent BBQ from fast food chains. And this place doesn't even live up to those. The menu has very little to choose from, and when you're told they don't have what you came for that completely throws off the experience. No BBQ place should ever run out of Chicken, Chicken is always a fall back plan for people to eat when they don't want Pork or Beef Brisket. They should really add more cuts of meat to their menu. Maybe add a Beef Rib, that would greatly increase this barren menu. The restroom is mediocre, seating arrangement is terrible. This restaurant is not good for groups over 6. Overall this place isn't that bad nor is it that good, just not a place that my wife and I will go out of the way for.
