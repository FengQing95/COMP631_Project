Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My sister & I went there on a Sunday night at 9 PM. There was a wait, but luckily we found two seats at the bar. Service was a bit slow and he wasn't as attentive since our drinks were empty most of the time. Wait time for pizza is around 40-45 mins. We ordered the Manalti Chicago Classic.
