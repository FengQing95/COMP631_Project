Little Goat Diner////There's a lot of hype behind this place, and for the most part, it lives up to that hype. The decor is cool and trendy, but not pretentious, the staff are generally of the young and hip variety, but all very unique, and the food has been very satisfying. My brother and I grab breakfast together every couple months and LIttle Goat became our go-to.
