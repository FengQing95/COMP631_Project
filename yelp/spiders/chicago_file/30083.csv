Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered the pepperoni deep dish pizza, bruschetta, and calamari.  The calamari was awesome - along with the marinara sauce!  Although the bruschetta could have used a light sauce, it was tasty.  The pizza was not my favorite, I did not eat the leftovers.  The cheese on the pizza became hard and made it difficult to enjoy the pizza.
