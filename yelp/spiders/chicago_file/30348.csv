Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We got the Large ($20.45) which is supposed to feed up to 4 people.  It came out with 8 to 9 slices and we were ALL full after ONE SLICE.  They pushed for us to get an appetizer since "each pie takes an hour to make" but decided to wait so we didn't spoil our appetite. We were STARVING by the time the pie came out, but believe me- one slice was MORE than enough.
