Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////If you're a vegetarian looking for a tapas place that offers more than the same 5 basic dishes every time you go - Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is the place to visit.  There menu has plenty of vegetarian options, and they are always willing to make it vegetarian if you ask them to.  I have been going here for years and it's one of my favorite tapas places in the city.  The service can be slow if they are super packed, but overall they are pretty good.  The ambience and decor are fun, and the sangrias are always good.
