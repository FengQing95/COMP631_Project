Little Goat Diner////There truly is no place in Chicago as wonderful as Little Goat Diner. I live a few blocks away and despite the sometimes long waits, this is my favorite place to eat. Whether you go by yourself or with friends you will have a great time. I am a vegetarian and there are many DELICIOUS options, plus they always take the time to prepare things exactly the way you want them. I love eating here all year round. The good is amazing, the staff friendly and the environment could not be nicer. Afterwards you're in one of the nicest neighborhoods - you can go for a stroll. Awesome place for a date as well, even if a bit loud - everyone is happy and chatty and it gets a bit loud from all the peeps talking. Highly recommend!!! Favorites: the grilled cheese, the veggie burger, the nachos (they can prepare them without meat), any dessert, and of course their breads which they make themselves! The breakfast is to die for!
