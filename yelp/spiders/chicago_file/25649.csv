Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza itself is so packed with stuff, it's ridiculous.  There's tons of cheese, tomatoes and tomato sauce.  The crust is impecable with a crunchy and buttery taste.  Just be warned though, after eating one slice, you might get food coma.  All 3 of us got food coma after eating 1-2 slices of the "Lou," and ended up having to call it a night.  But, the pizza itself was delicious.  Highly recommend it if you're visiting Chicago.
