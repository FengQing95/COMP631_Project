Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pizza was good but service was terrible, the waiter was terrible and we had a friend who couldn't eat cheeses. They didn't allow her to change any of the thin crust pizzas to have no cheese, Â and the chicken sandwich was sad. Don't recommend, deep dish pizza isn't that special anyway
