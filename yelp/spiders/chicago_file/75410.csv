Little Goat Diner////Today I had the best breakfest I have probably ever had in my life. After going to probably all the other breakfest spots in Chicago I can say this is the best in terms of flavor, ambience, and uniquness. I had the Spanish omlette and the Omlette of the day they were both phenomenal.
