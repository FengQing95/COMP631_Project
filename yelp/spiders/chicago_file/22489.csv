Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When in Chicago, do as they do, and grab a Chicago Classic Deep Dish.  I needed something besides the downtown tourist spots and went to Lou's for lunch.  My only regret is the personal pizza wasn't enough for me!  Almost bought a second to take back to Arizona but heard they just opened one.  Can't wait to get home but will always come back to Lou's.
