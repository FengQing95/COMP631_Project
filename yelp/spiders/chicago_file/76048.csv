Little Goat Diner////We decided to sample the fat Elvis pancakes, which included peanut butter and banana as well as a maple bacon syrup. They were delicious and great for all of us to share. The most memorable thing that we had, and seriously one of the best things I've had to eat in the last five years, was the this little pig goes to China. It was an absolute flavor symphony that worked just about everywhere in my mouth! It included a sesame cheddar biscuit, some boss sausage, an egg over top and some delicious sweet and spicy chili garlic chive sauce. This is the sort of thing that I could write a book about.
