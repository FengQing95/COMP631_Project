Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////In any event, first order of business, a pitcher of Sangria!  Tasty, a bit on the sweet side, but still good.  Our waitress seriously sucked though.  She moved about as fast as a snail.  But it was okay, because the tapas were good!!  Bacon wrapped dates... my fav!!  There were a few we ordered that weren't out of the world... the sweet potatoes, a little mushy.  But otherwise, everything we got was great!  And we have to love yelp... checked in and got a free tapas size dessert!
