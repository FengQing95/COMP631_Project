Smoque BBQ////What is your quest or shall I say, Smoque's quest for a distinct rub? Salt-n-Pepa, that wouldn't be interesting enough to market. They are heavy on the pepper and must be laying down more than a ten spot of ingredients. Beyond the Dr., the additional flavors are subtle and become indistinguishable even for the light FM dippity doer. They could reduce the amount of ingredients by half and the majority wouldn't taste the difference and please, don't give me that intentional blending of flavors between the rub and a sauce. Depending on the thickness of the meat, either the pepper or the smoke dominates over the subtleties in seeking the Holy Grail, I mean Smoque's interpretation of the perfect rub. Btw, was that an African or European swallow?
