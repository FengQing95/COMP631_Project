Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place was great!  From the moment I walked in, I liked this place.  Unlike so many other restaurants in the neighborhood, the hostesses were super friendly, helpful, and accommodating.  They squeezed my party in even though we didn't have a reservation, which was great.   Then there's the decor.  You feel like you've been transported to some old time speakeasy.  The decor some how instantly made me feel cooler.  Sigh, and don't even get me started on our waiter.  I totally had a huge crush on him.  He was a rugged, actor looking guy.  And on top of his good looks he was incredibly friendly and super knowledgeable about the food.
