Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The bar has the full menu and the bar tender was welcoming. We had the filet mignon and the steak frites. We also started with brussel Â sprouts (a bit oily but tasty). The meat was done just right! The fries weren't oily and came in a generous portion (there may have been a hint of truffle oil).They were served with a buttery dijon. Delectable!
