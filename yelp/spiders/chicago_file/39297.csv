Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The atmosphere is a throwback to a poorly lit 30's-40's style bar and high scale restaurant with large plush booths, overstocked bar, solid wood bar too, and couches in the waiting area. After a small wait, we were escorted to our table downstairs and were given some time to check out the menu. Our waiter was very attentive and provided us with answers to any and all questions we had. I'm a big bourbon guy so the Old Fashion is what I ordered to start off, it was fantastic and definitely on par with some of the best in the city.
