The Purple Pig////The blood sausage was tasty, but not as good as the Spanish blood sausage. The experience was like eating a hot dog and nothing great.  The pork shoulder was good, but the best dish was the blade steak.   It was flavored well, that it did not need the nudja sausage.  The nudja sausage tasted like Chinese sausage...not to my liking.
