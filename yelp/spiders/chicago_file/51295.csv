Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The two saving graces for this meal were the Sangria was good and that i was near full when I decided to eat here.  Absent those two things it wouldn't have even been worth coming here.  It is such a shame because the space is charming and it being a Lettuce restaurant carries a bit of weight with me.  They just fell really short.
