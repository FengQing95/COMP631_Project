Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////BEYOND AMAZING! I travel all over the country and enjoy food like no other and Bevettes was one of my top dining experiences. Not only is the food to die for, but I love the atmosphere. The upstairs is a typical steak house, more buttoned up with an old 1920s vibe but when you go into the basement it's like you're entering a speakeasy! Super cool bar with candle light and old vintage lamps, boar heads on the exposed brick walls and they play really cool underground rap music.
