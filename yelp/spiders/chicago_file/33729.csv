Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My mom, bless her, is not an adventurous eater.  Now, she is a bit of a gourmand and an exceptional baker, but she is very picky when it comes to her meat being thoroughly torched and certainly doesn't touch bone marrow.  She doesn't mean any offense when she orders her meat well done and is fully aware of all the downsides (both in terms of what meat will be used for it and of the scorn of the chef) - it's just a personal aversion to anything more than a slight pink.  She went with the stroganoff and was as impressed with it as she's ever been.  I sampled some of it myself and it was heavenly.  The noodles had the perfect bite to them, the meat was done to her liking while retaining its flavor and being buttery-tender.  Sublime.
