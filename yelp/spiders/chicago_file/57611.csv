Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Some standouts for me: The Pan Catalan, bacon mac and cheese, bacon wrapped dates, and the patatas bravas. All of these were incredibly tasty, and something I'd recommend you NEEDING to get while you're there. I thinkt the patatas bravas was my favorite. I've had them done a dozen different ways by different Spanish restaurants, but the sauce they put on them here really stuck out to me. It had a nice spicy kick but wasn't too much for people who aren't a huge fan of spice. Just really well done.
