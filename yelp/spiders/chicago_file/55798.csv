Smoque BBQ////Our party trickled in ~7pm on a Friday night and this place was just beginning to get completely packed, the line running out the door.  Staff is as friendly as can be, and helps to facilitate the line and counter to table self-serve and seating.  Open view into the kitchen shows this place is spotless and a tightly run unit.  Gotta love this place.
