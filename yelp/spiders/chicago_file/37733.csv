Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I would say this place is by far my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The service was outstanding (the best I've ever received), our server was super knowledgeable and made excellent recommendations. The food....omg the food. It was perfection. We started off with the steak tartare and we're embarrassed at how quickly Â we were eating it. Our steaks were impeccably cooked and the cocktails we're tried textbook style. Don't even look at the prices on the menu because once that check comes you won't even care! If you haven't tried this place yet you have to make it your next stop !
