Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Yum, yum, yum! I usually prefer thin crust pizza over deep dish, but this was SO good!! We arrived around 7:45pm on a Friday night and were seated within 30 minutes. Pizza came out shortly after that (be sure to pre-order while you wait!) and it was steaming hot and smelled oh SO good. We ordered a large for 3 people (I know - we were hungry) plus a calamari appetizer. Calamari was okay - you could definitely taste that it was fresh, but it wasn't anything too amazing. The pizza is definitely the star here (as it should be). Everything about it was delicious and the 2 pieces we took home were equally as good the next day. I've also been to Giordano's, but Lou Malnati's is way better.
