Little Goat Diner////The damage per plate was reasonable given the quantity and quality; I saw nothing over $20 on the menu. The atmosphere furthermore deserves a mention, low-fuss but very chic. The next door bakery/bar/coffee shop is a nice touch with plenty of tempting baked/caffeinated options. Finally, we actually saw Top Chef Stephanie upstairs; it's refreshing to see a celebrity chef actually overseeing her operation.
