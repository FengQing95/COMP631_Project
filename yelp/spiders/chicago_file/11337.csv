Art Institute of Chicago////We had about an hour before the museum closed so a friend of ours took us on a rapid fire tour of all the favorite works of art in the museum. In that hour, we actually saw probably the vast majority of the museum. Of course, we didn't get a chance to really sit down and admire each painting/photo/piece of art, but we got a feel for what the museum had to offer.
