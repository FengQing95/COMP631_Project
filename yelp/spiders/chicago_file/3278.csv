The Purple Pig////4) My first bite into the octopus dish was overly garlicky and it did not mention anything about garlic on the menu. I have an allergy to garlic and my throat was starting to itch! At this point both my water and wine were gone and I had to flag down a busser to get more water. A third bartender noticed I was sending smoke signals and came over. I told him I was having a reaction so he cleared the octopus, handed me the food menu, and asked if I wanted anything else. Kudos to this guy!!! I guess he alerted the guy who initially took my order who seemed annoyed and said it was the first time anyone sent that dish back! I told him I needed milk or tea to help my throat which he got right away.
