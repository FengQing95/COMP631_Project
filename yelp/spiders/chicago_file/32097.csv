Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pizza was a 3.5/5. Service was 0/5. We order before we got on the L for up north. Got there, had to wait in the rain, no worries, got drinks went back out in the rain. After waiting like 45 min since getting there we went back inside to check and they were like "oh yeah it's right here". After telling us they would call our name. I get you're a popular place but how about managing the place better. Idk if the pizza was worth it for the annoyance and hassle.
