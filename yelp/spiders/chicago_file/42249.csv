Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is my favorite tapas restaurant of all the ones I have tried! (I have been to Cafe Iberico's, Emilio's, Arco de Cuchilleros and Cafe Valencia)  The selection of hot and cold tapas is amazing and everything we ordered was phenomenal!  We also tried the red sangria which was very smooth and delicious.  I would definitely recommend reservations because this place is CRAZY busy on Friday and Saturday nights!  We got there at about 8:30 and got sat down to eat at around 10:15, but it was sooo worth the wait!  Definitely try the Beef Short Rib and the Beef Empanada!
