Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I was inspired to write this review after seeing its current rating...3.5 stars?!  What are you people thinking?!  This is my absolute FAVORITE tapas restaurant.  I recently moved to SF (by the way, don't believe anything you hear about the "amazing" cuisine....with the exception of Chinese food and seafood, Chicago wins, hands down), and babareeba is on my list of "Things I Crave in Chicago".
