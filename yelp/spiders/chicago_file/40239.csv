Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The restaurant has a really interactive BYOB policy. You can bring a standard size bottle of wine (750ml) per two people. If you want to avoid the corking fee all you have to do is share a glass with another table. We sent a glass out and we received a glass. It was such a fun experience!
