Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Wow.  People have raved about Wildberry to me for well over a year now, and I finally made the visit on Sunday morning, waited the hour and a half for a table, and have to say the meal was delicious.  First and foremost, be prepared to wait.  Do NOT wait until you are at the point of starvation before going to Wildberry.  Make sure you arrive a solid hour to 90 minutes before you will be at your "drop dead of hunger" point and put your name in.  There are plenty of sights nearby to entertain yourself while you're waiting - go for a walk along the lake, check out the bean, go hit up some stores on State Street.
