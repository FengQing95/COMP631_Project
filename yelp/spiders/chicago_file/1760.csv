Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This place is absolutely awesome! No wonder it has so many positive reviews. The food is heavenly. We came here 2 days in a row and each time we were so impressed with whatever we ordered. Also the service is very efficient. Sofia waited at our table and she's such a wonderful person! We'll definitely come back here when we visit Chicago again...
