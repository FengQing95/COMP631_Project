The Purple Pig////Exceeded my expectations! I heard good things about the crispy pigs eat and it tasted better than I thought, probably one of the best things I've had. We got the times wrong and arrived 30 minutes early but there was already a short line, but the wait was worth it. We got seated right away and food arrived quickly and before drinks which was weird but no complaints, staff apologized for the wait. Besides the food the staff really made it a 5 star experience, but honestly even if service was terrible this would be one of the restaurants I would go back to, food is just too good!
