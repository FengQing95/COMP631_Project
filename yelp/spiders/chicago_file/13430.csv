Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great pizza... but personally I think it's overrated. It takes 30 mins to make a pizza, so order an app while you wait. Their salad dressing is very good. I loved my spinach basil anchovy thin crust pizza. That's because I don't eat red meat or pork. So the special didn't do it for me. Anyway, my pizza was delicious. Just don't think it's worth all the hype. Be prepared for the wait.
