Smoque BBQ////Eat in or order takeout. Everything was delicious. The brisket melts in your mouth. I didn't even need sauce, it was so good. The St. Louis ribs smoked flavor was perfect. The sides were really good and not too heavy. The coleslaw was fresh. I loved that the cornbread had bits of corn in it and it wasn't too dry. The beans were also really good and light, it had chunks of smoked meat in it.
