Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I wanted to bring a party of 21 to this restaurant, but when I called to speak to a manager about a reservation, I was very rudely told "no reservations!". Understand not taking reservations for small parties, but do you really expect a party of 21 to come in without a reservation? I guess business is so good they don't need to worry about customer service, so they won't need to worry about getting my business again, either.
