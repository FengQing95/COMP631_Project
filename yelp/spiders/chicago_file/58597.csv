Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////It's a great place for a large group and for sharing so many delicious foods. The atmosphere is also very lovely and the service has always been great. However, recently we ordered delivery and the portions were so tiny! The beef tenderloin with blue cheese only included two tiny pieces of beef and the fried chicken thighs had only 5 small pieces. The food was still very delicious but the portion-sizes were very disappointing given how much delivery costed.
