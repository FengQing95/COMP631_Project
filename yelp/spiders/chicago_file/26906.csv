Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came here on weekend in Chicago to get the deep dish experience. There was about a 40 min wait after we put our name down, and they recommended we order our pizzas ahead of time. When we they were ready for us, it was still prob about another 40 min before our pizzas came out. The menu also had wet pizza sauce on it which Â was a little unsettling. We had "The Lou" deep dish which was pretty good, though tbh I'm not really a deep dish kinda guy. Food quality 4/5 Service/wait 2/5 Cleanliness 3/5.
