Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered the classic chicago with their signature sausage, tomato and added mushrooms. You will need the extra side of sauce - I did. Once I added my extra sauce and fresh onions on top it was really good. I don't know that I am the biggest fan of the buttercrust as it seemed to make the pizza almost a bit soggy like. Even still - it was SO GOOD.
