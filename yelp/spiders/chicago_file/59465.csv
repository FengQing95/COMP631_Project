Smoque BBQ////I love BBQ. I need it. Sometimes, I wake up in the morning and I want ribs. I haven't smelled ribs, I haven't had ribs in forever, I just wake up with this gut feeling that tells me-hey, you need some damn ribs in your life. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, I need some BBQ in my belly. Maybe it's because I lived in Texas those two years of my life, I don't know.
