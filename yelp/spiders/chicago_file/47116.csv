Smoque BBQ////Best way to sum up Smoque for me is that it was a religious experience. Not sure I've ever had BBQ that was so amazing. The Brisket and Pulled Pork are unbelievable. I tried the sauce, but preferred it without any sauce. It's that good. Generally speaking, meat is not a huge part of my diet. But when I do indulge, I always appreciate high quality. This meal was perfection Their smoke flavor and seasoning are incredible. The meat is tender and moist. The Mac and Cheese is wonderful, too. More souffle-like as opposed to creamy. Beans are a bit spicy, but delicious. The Peach Cobbler is to die for. I could have made a meal out of that. What I found kind of cool is that if you look at the menu photography on their website, the food actually looks exactly like that in real life!  Smoque was worth the wait. Can't wait to go back and try the Ribs and Sausage, although I'm not sure I ever want anything but their Pulled Pork. Crowded as hell, but they manage it well.   Highly recommended.
