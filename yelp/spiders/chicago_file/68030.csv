Little Goat Diner////The service was excellent, too! Casey was our server and he was wonderful. He offered some great food and drink recommendations based on what we like and were feeling for the night. In taking a look around, I noticed that most of the staff and servers that were taking care of guests were smiling and pleasant. And the guests were happy too! Cool beans.
