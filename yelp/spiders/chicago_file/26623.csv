Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I would have left not knowing you can order your pizza with no line and wait for a text to be seated. They def need to make this more well known!!! However we went and walked around and came back after about 20 minutes and got seated. Then was additional 20-30 minutes for our pizza to arrive, service was excellent and the pizza.... best gluten free pizza I've ever had. SO GOOD. Can't wait to fly back to Chicago just for Lou Malnati's.
