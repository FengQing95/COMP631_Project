Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////i went here with a group of ppl. It was pleasant, although very crowded for a wednesday night (which made me think, wow this place must be good) we each ordered two dishes and passed all of them around the table, i like the idea of ordering as you stay hungry, and the food was really good. I would say try the braised lamb, reminded me of a middle eastern dish i had in egypt, sweet and especially loved the peanuts they had on top. unusual but delicious.
