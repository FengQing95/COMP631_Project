Smoque BBQ////I came here expecting great BBQ after hearing rave reviews and good things from friends, and that's exactly what i got. My Family and I arrived at Smoque around 7 pm, waited in line for about 10 mins and got a table as soon as we were done ordering. I ordered the Brisket platter and got the beans along with the mac n' cheese as my sides. I also got a side of pulled pork. The Brisket was tender and delicious and had a nice smoke ring which is always important. The mac n' cheese was mmmmazing, the beans i thought were just ok a bit to sweet for my liking. The pulled pork was Delicious, i smothered them with the Carolina sauce, which made it even better. The Nibbles of St. Louis us style Ribs that i stole off my sisters plate were very good, i prefer the St. Louis over the baby backs. I cant wait to go back and try the Memphis style Ribs ans the Peach Cobbler. Hungry? What are you waiting for?! Go To Smoque..NOW!
