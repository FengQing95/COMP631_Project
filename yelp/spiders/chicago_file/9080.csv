Art Institute of Chicago////Speaking of the curators, they do an outstanding job of preserving objects, rotating them for display, and designing and redesigning entire wings. For example, the Chinese and Japanese art section is being reworked now. Doubtless some of the scrolls need to be removed from the light, but they will be replaced with other pieces. I am looking forward to viewing the wing when it reopens.
