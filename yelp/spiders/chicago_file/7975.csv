Art Institute of Chicago////There is a really great photo show up here right now.  It reaches into the AI's photo vaults and pulls out works from so many photographers (think everyone from Eugene Atget to Dawoud Bey.)  The show looks to compare work from their earliest days to the later parts of their career.
