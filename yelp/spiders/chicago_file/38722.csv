Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Sides to try - Elotes Corn 5/5! so delicious and not something you can find everywhere. Loaded Baked potato 5/5 - uh yea how fancy can a baked potato get, well this one takes the cake seasoned with large pieces of cubed bacon, chives, sour cream and cheddar. They even prep the potato inside so it has been seasoned. We were blown away by this simple concept executed so thoughtfully. This beats the millionaire's potato at RPM.
