Smoque BBQ////The ribs accompanied by Smoque's classic BBQ sauce, mac n cheese, coleslaw, cornbread and peach cobbler was one of the best meals I've ever had. Really busy in the late afternoon, even though we went on a week day, but the meal was well worth it! A must if you haven't tried this place already.
