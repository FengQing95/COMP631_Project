Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We went for an early dinner here and the place was pretty slow so the service was very good! not sure if they would be as accommodating with a busier restaurant! but I digress we had a bread filled with cheese that was some of the best bread I've ever had!!! Then the pizza came and I was floored! The pizza looked, smelled, and tasted so good! like nothing I've had before! Lou's is a 5 star stunner all day!!!
