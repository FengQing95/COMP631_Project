Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've been here twice now and both meals have been fabulous.  The Main lobster is a knockout and a must order.  On my second visit we tried some new items that were incredible - lamb, beef stroganoff and creamed spinach.  The service is top notch from start to finish.  The setting can't be beat.  This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago right now.
