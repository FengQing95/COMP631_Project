Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Started with spinach bread stuffed with cheese and spinach and pizza split in half - first half is the Malnati pizza with lean sausage, mozzarella and tomato sauce on butter crust (so good) and second half is Lou's pizza with spinach, garlic, basil, onion and mushroom on garlic butter crust!! I would get the Malnati's pizza again. Overall a great experience.
