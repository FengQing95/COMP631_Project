Art Institute of Chicago////A must if you're visiting Chicago.  It is no wonder this has been ranked in the top three of all museums in the world.  It is massive and sprawling, you can easily spend a couple of days just roaming around soaking it in, enjoying creations by so many world class artists.  As you should.  What a wonderful visit.  Simply extraordinary and so moving.
