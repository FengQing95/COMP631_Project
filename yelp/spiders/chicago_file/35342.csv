Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I questioned giving them the four stars when I found out they charged my boyfriend for my birthday dessert. He did not specify what he wanted, just mentioned it was my birthday, so they brought the most expensive option and charged for it! When you are spending a very pretty penny, I don't think a small complimentary dessert is unreasonable.
