Art Institute of Chicago////Love coming here and just getting lost in the beauty of it all. Outside is just as beautiful as the inside. I recommend dining in the loop or Streeterville, it is a short walk as the food prices can be a bit pricey inside the museum. If the garden is open, enjoy a nice picnic or latte there!
