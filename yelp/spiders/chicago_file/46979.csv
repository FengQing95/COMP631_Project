Smoque BBQ////Best BBQ I've had in Chicago. Blows Honey One, Smoke Daddy, and Fat Willy's out of the water. There's usually a huge line, often out the door, but don't let this discourage you, I've never waited more than 30 minutes for a seat. The food would be worth a wait twice as long, anyway. The brisket is great, the ribs are fantastic and all the sides I've tried have been fantastic. The guys that run this are unpretentious and seem to have figured out a way to make juicy and flavorful meat. I only wish this type of food was healthier so I could go more often.
