Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The ambiance is dark and feels like another time period - our waiter was animated and courteous. And the steak - I think we ordered one of each - so good!! I would have mayyyybee wanted a bit more crust for that crunch - but the flavor of the aged steak compared to their already prime cuts was just awesome.
