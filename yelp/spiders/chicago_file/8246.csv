Art Institute of Chicago////Huge collection of artwork! I am absolutely in love with this beautiful museum! I really do regret not being able to see all of the galleries in the amount of short time I had when I first visited this museum on Friday. I got in for $12 with my student ID (for you students out there who wants to get in for cheaper prices), and it was definitely worth it. Great Impressionist art collections along with some modern art (they have a wing dedicated only to that while the rest are for the traditional art works). There is also some Frank Lloyd Wright works to look at, if you are into architectural sketches. After all, his works of the houses are located in Illinois!
