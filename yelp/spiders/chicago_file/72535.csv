Little Goat Diner////I had the breakfast spaghetti with crab and clams that sort of reminded me of egg foo yong with broth until that luscious egg yolk popped once I got to the center of the dish. Yum! The side of pea tendrils was also the perfect balance of fresh, sour, salty, crunchy. When I first brought the pea tendrils to my mouth, I could smell the dirt smell of fresh vegetables, a kind of rawness, but once I tasted it, I thought the tendrils were well cooked, still crunchy but infused with the cooking flavors.
