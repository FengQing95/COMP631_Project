Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Recommended this place by trusty Chicago friends, who after dutifully trying a few places in the city, they always come back to Lou Malnati's! Chicago deep dish is somewhat of a cult classic with a cult following to rival it. Our wait for Lou Malnati's was 2 and a half hours long, in which we went for a walk, some shopping... it was long to be fair, and still undecided if it was worth it or not since there's lots of delicious deep dish in the city. However, the pizza we had was absolutely delicious and I would go again in a heartbeat, but maybe not for 2.5 hour wait again. Â A must try if you're into deep dish pizza or want to try some classic Chi-town pie!
