Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We waited for a loooooong time for our first dish to come.  We finished it in  seconds and waited for the other dishes to come but they kept bringing just one dish at a time and  had to wait between 10 - 20 minutes in between each dish which was not the best way to be consuming tapas..... so frustrating since we ordered everything all at once and this ruined the whole tapas experience.
