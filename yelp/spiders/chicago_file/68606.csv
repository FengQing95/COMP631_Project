Little Goat Diner////I went to Little Goat last week on a Sunday for brunch with some friends from out of town, and unexpectedly waited about 30-35 min for a table for 6 (not as long as I had anticipated). The restaurant was vibrant and packed, so I was excited by the atmosphere and the dozens of smiling customers in the dining area.
