Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you're going to eat Chicago pizza, this is the place to be.  The rest are just tourist traps and lesser quality products.  Four stars because of the weak ambiance and lack of the menu options.  If they had better salads, appetizers, and beer selection then yes.  But if you just want pizza then this is the place to be.
