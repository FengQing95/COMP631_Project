Little Goat Diner////Second visit: more mac and cheese and the sloppy goat.  A quick word about the sandwich, my first bite was of the goat alone and it was a little salty.  I was concerned.  But, when I ate the sandwich altogether (with bread and coleslaw), it was pretty much perfect.  I dream about this sandwich.  (Note, we also had the banana spilt and it was delicious).
