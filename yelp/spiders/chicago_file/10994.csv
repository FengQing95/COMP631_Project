Art Institute of Chicago////Art and architecture of the Art Institute speaks for itself - but the volunteers and security guards in the modern wing were SO nice and helpful, it made our visit that much more enjoyable. I came with a friend and her baby and so many people stopped to say hello or ask us if we needed help/directions to exhibits etc. It really was so nice.
