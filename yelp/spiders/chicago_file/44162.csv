Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The Sangria is the best thing here! I really loved their spicy potatoes (They are the closest to the real ones in Barcelona that I have had in Chicago), their bacon wrapped dates, and the stuffed mushrooms. Other than that, I think their selection is very short.  My friend and I did not enjoy the meatballs everyone was raving about.  Overall, foodwise, I was very disappointed... Sangria-wise, Completely worth it!
