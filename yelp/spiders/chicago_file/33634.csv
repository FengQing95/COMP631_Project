Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////At the restaurant they showed us two booths (and we certainly appreciated their attempt), across from each other. That wouldn't work. There were lots and lots of empty tables, including downstairs. Can't we just move two together? Again, no! Wha? Ok, maybe 2-3 inches closer, but definitely not together. Wow, again, never heard of this before. Someone canceled and we got two "half moon booths" next to each other. Fine, we'll survive.
