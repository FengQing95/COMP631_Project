Smoque BBQ////First, expect to wait if you're coming during peak eating time periods. The place is pretty small and the line can get pretty long. The ribs here, both baby back and St. Louis are amazing. The brisket is tender and has great flavor. The pulled pork also is really flavorful and has a great texture and smokiness to it. There are also several sauces you can try everything with. I haven't tried many of the sides, but I can tell you that the small serving of fries is almost certainly enough for a single person. A large portion can feed 2-3 people with fries.
