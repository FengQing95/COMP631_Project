Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The only reason I did not give a five star rating is that the pizza was not the traditional Chicago deep dish style that as a tourist I thought of.  On the plus side each me member of my family had  the individual pizzas with a light buttery crust which were delicious and a perfect size. The service was great. The food quality was superb.
