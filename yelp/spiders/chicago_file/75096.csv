Little Goat Diner////As others have mentioned, one thing that can't be disputed are the prices; I thought everything was pretty fair for the portion size and I think only one item on the food menu was more than $20, so it's got that going for it. Â The space is cool, the bar is great, and if you don't like waiting in line, the hours allow for getting creative by showing up during off-peak times to slide right in.
