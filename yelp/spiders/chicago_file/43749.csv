Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We found the atmosphere, drinks, and overall environment are more the seller here. As I stated, the food is good, just nothing out of the ordinary for tapas. Service is nothing to complain about. Great for groups and even for a date (hopefully someone you've been dating cause it gets loud).
