Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We recently ate here while on vacation over New Years. It was amazing! Everything we had was delicious. The bacon wrapped dates are amazing. Everyone should try those! The Brussel sprout salad had the most amazing nutty flavor due to the almonds but they did not over power the dish. The spicy potatoes were good, but I could have used more spice. We also had the steak with blue cheese, meatballs with sherry sauce, the scallops, and the Moroccan Chicken. Â All were amazing. However, the best part of the whole night was the Burrata. The flavor of this delicious snack is indescribable.
