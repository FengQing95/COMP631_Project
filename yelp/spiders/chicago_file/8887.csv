Art Institute of Chicago////I love museums in general, especially art museums.  I love the lion statues in the front (sometimes it dons a Chicago Bears helmet, which I thought it was hilarious).  My favorite pieces from the collection include: Georges Seurat's 'A Sunday on La Grande Jatte,' Gustave Caillebotte's 'Paris Street; Rainy Day,' pieces from Claude Monet, Henri Matisse, Picasso, and Gauguin.  My most favorite collection is the Thorne Miniature Rooms - there are a total of 68 rooms in which you can see elements of European interiors from the late 13th century to the 1930s, and American furnishings from the 17th century to the 1930s.  the scale is of one inch to one foot, the models were constructed between 1932 and 1940.  I love it and it's a nice treat!  If you're an educator, the museum also offers free credits in various art classes/workshops.  There is a parking deck next to the Institute and a modern art wing was added a few years back.
