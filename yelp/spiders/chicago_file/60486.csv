Smoque BBQ////4) DRIVE... if you don't have a car invite a friend who does, don't pass it by, it is not advertised well unless you know where it is, there is lots of free parking just North on Avondale and in front on Pulaski though its not the best neighborhood so leave your brand new Ferrari at home, my friend got the tire cover stolen off her jeep while we were eating... eeek.
