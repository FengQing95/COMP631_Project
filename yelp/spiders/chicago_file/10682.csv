Art Institute of Chicago////My favorite art genres are surrealism and impressionism so when I found out that the AI houses one of the more impressive French impressionist collections in America, I was excited. Although the entrance fee is high (like 20-ish dollars?) I do think it's worth a visit if you're in Chicago. You can gaze upon Manets, Cezannes, Monets and Renoirs to your heart's content. Of course, you can't forget the gigantic Seurat painting: the famous Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grand Jatte. Incredible to see up close. There's even a pretty good collection of Van Goghs here as well!
