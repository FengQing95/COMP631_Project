Smoque BBQ////Service is terrific! If I lived near the area, I'd be a daily diner. After trying multiple items on their menu (the owner let me have a sampler), I'd say that EVERYTHING is worth getting, but my favorite is brisket. The owner found out that I liked spicy things, so he added some candied jalepenos to my plate. YUM!
