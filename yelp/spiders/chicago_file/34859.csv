Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Hands down one of my favorite and most recommended steak houses in Chicago. Which a wide selections of steaks and seafood, it's hard to ignore the bar. Excellent selected and hand crafted cocktails Bavettes is hands down a winner. Excellent dim lighting provides a great place to eat, drink, and speak.
