Little Goat Diner////Making it here was such a milestone considering it's basically all anyone in the West/South Loop area talks about.  I went with some friends on a Tuesday around 4pm so we got seating right away which I know can be rare.  My only complaint is probably that the service was slow even though they didn't seem packed so I don't know how that would play out when they're busy. I didn't get any of their main dishes on this trip, but it's all diner food as you could probably guess.  I was amazed at the extent of the menu and they had a lot of customizable options for burgers and other dishes.  I got the hot chocolate and a cinnamon roll (I think they usually only serve these during the morning since they run out)  which was smothered in icing.  What's not to love about that?  I think I enjoyed the whipped cream a little more than the actual hot chocolate (little grains at the bottom of the mug, might've just been the mix).  And maybe share the cinnamon roll it was very enjoyable but definitely 3 full days worth of sugar :).
