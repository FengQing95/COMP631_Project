Little Goat Diner////This was pretty great! I got the special blue plate and it was amazing. The only thing I didn't like was in the little goat bakery the cinnamon roll was hard and room temperature instead of being hot and warm. The waiter we had also wasn't very timely. But overall, the food was good and I'd go back again.
