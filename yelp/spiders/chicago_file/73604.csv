Little Goat Diner////Great breakfast place to go to. Who would've thought I would be eating kimchi at a brunch place in Chicago? I tried the kimchi, bacon, eggs breakfast thingy with more kimchi on the side. The kimchi added a refreshing taste to breakfast. If you are into Asian food, I would recommend it.
