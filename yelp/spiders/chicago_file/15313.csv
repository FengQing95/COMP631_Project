Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Awesome Chicago deep dish pizza! The portions are just right and the prices are reasonable. I also really love their Chicken Club salad. Also really enjoyed the fried zucchini and stuffed spinach bread as appetizers. And the drinks aren't too bad in terms of price and alcohol content.
