Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute ranks up there with the Louve and the Met as one of the finest museums in the world. With a steller collection of paintings by Monet and Van Gogh, the museum has a breathtaking lineup of impressionist works. It houses George Seurat's famous "A Sunday on La Grande Jatte" as well as some amazing stuff from Asia, just to scratch the surface. Make sure you check out the ancient armor, swords and guns in the basement. It used to keep me occupied for hours when I was younger.
