Little Goat Diner////Before me is the Spanish omelette, made with cheddar cheese, pickled peppers, masa chips, chopped tomatoes, and sour cream. Sis ordered the Bull's Eye french toast, which comes with scrambled eggs and perfectly crisped chicken strips, the breading looks thick but crunchy, along with sweet onion brioche and bbq maple syrup. The french toast pulls apart easily in her hands, something she would have been embarrassed to do months ago, and again asks what it is that I want. Sitting straight up, stiff, I can see the two girls in the next booth feeding each other lovingly. A college degree that's stimulating AND useful, for one thing. Work that's exciting, socially valuable, AND pays well. A soulmate who's sexually and emotionally stimulating AND loyal and comforting. Children that are beautiful, smart, obedient, AND independent. And everything I buy to be the best of its kind. I don't think that's too hard to imagine, too much to ask. At the table next to us, a guy undoes his man bun and says, "What if I take the job and end up hating it?" The guy with him nods sullenly. "Whose fault would that be?" I ask a busboy for water. Our waitress arrives instead with one ooey gooey cinnabun (actual name) instead and sits it before me. I don't remember ordering it but rip it to shreds with my fingers, licking every drop of frosting, sopping up the crumbs, while with my other hand I'm waving my Credo card at the hostess and saying we have to go. Five stars.
