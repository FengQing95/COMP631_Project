Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////There's this large tall fluorescent sign outside that says, "Lou Malnati's" - you couldn't miss it. We walked in and waited for the rest of our 10 person group to arrive. Inside I felt a sense of nostalgia even though I'd never been there before; but I felt the history speaking through the brick walls and cliche nicely framed photos all over the walls.
