The Purple Pig////The food was delicious, and service was great. There were a lot of people when we arrived so we waited a while (even though we had reservation) and it was very loud in the restaurant. We were also sitting very close to the people beside us, so it was hard to get intimate. That being said, the playing and taste of the food is top notch
