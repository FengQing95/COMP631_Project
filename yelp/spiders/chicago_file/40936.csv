Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////A large group of us went Saturday.  The place is jumping and the crowd is younger than our contemporaries, but we didn't feel out of place.  The food was terrific, as was the service.  Our daughter, who has been going there since it opened several years ago, marveled at how it has been able to maintain the consistency of excellence.  It must be because of great managers like "Jessica" who made sure that the evening was perfect.  Bravo!
