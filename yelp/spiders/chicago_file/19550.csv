Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I mean, what can you say. It's amazing, it's fattening, it's chicago on a round plate.  My ONLY problem is that I understand the need to make a lot of money, and go national with this, but Lou's lost points in my book when I came home, found I can order Lou's online and have it shipped to my door in NJ.  So I did, heated it up, and it tasted identical to the pizza we had on Wells St.  That's a problem for me since I'm a huge fan of keeping regional cuisine treasures, regional.
