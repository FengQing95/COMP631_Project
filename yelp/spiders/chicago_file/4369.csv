The Purple Pig////The first time I visited The Purple Pig I had to wait about an hour and a half as I had a party of 7 with no reservation and it was a Friday night. The great thing about going with a large group is being able to try out over 10 dishes (we placed 2 orders of some dishes with a group this large) without breaking the bank.
