Smoque BBQ////I wasn't fairly hungry but as I sank my teeth into my 1st bite and the juices and meat touched the 1000s of taste buds on my tongue I became an animal. Â You know when you're starving and you just stuff food in your face non-stop until you feel yourself and your stomach bulge out like a 3month old prego lady? Unfortunately I did that but caught myself 1/2 way so I could enjoy the sandwich more.
