Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I wanted Chicago deep dish and I got it. This place came highly recommended by several of my friends. Went for lunch and got a personal pepperoni deep dish with the buttercrust. It was delicious. Sat at the bar and service was great. Hotel gave me a coupon for free dessert. Cookie pizza equally delicious! You must go if you want Chicago deep dish.
