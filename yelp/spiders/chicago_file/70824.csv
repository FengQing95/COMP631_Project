Little Goat Diner////Little Goat is a fun dining option that we often taking visiting friends and family to. Make a reservation online, though know that you might still have to wait for a table after you show up on a weekend for brunch (last time we were there we didn't get seated until 20 minutes after we arrived... and this was even after showing up on time for our reservation). Also, it gets loud in the restaurant during peak times. These two cons aside, I have been here for lunch and dinner numerous times. I am a gluten free diner and have dined here with individuals with other dietary restrictions including dairy and garlic allergies, and the waitstaff does a great job of checking and modifying dishes to make sure they are appropriate for our group. Last time I was there, I got the omelette, which was heavenly! The cheese was melted so perfectly on the inside. Â My husband is a big eater and has been disappointed in the portion size of some plates in the past, so check with your server if you are exceptionally hungry. Most entrees don't come with sides, so you will need to order sides in addition to the main plates. The sides are usually a sharing size. They also have outdoor seating!
