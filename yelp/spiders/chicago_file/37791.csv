Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I have made reservations three months in advance for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. It was so worth the wait! I do not go to steakhouses Â but this was an exception do to many of the variety of selections. We started off with the baked goat cheese which was phenomenal. For entrees I had the spiced fried chicken and the boyfriend had the filet mignon and said it was delicious! I was so surprised with my dish since the chicken had so much flavor and was not overwhelming. Overall we had a great experience and my bf enjoyed his birthday dinner. I advise to make a reservation before hand. I'll definitely be back to try other delicious stuff of their menu!
