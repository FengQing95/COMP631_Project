Art Institute of Chicago////The lions are a chicago icon. Special exhibits here never disappoint. The  architecture one  over the summer was really interesting. The permanent exhibits can keep you occupied for hours...everything from african to asian to weird modern stuff. This is where I fell in love with my favorite painting "The Landing Place". Every time I come here I have to stare at it just a little more. Free on tuesdays!
