Little Goat Diner////Really good, really busy, and pretty pricey. This is the kind of spot you visit rarely and wish you could go to more. Everything is too delicious anyway. Also the parking situation is inconvenient as hell. Definitely treat yourself every once in a while. Especially after some hard drinking. The grease will set you free.
