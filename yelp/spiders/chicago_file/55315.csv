Smoque BBQ////My wife and I have been to Smoque 4 times.  We've never been disappointed!  The food is fast, delicious but come hungry and ready to wait.  The first time we went we had beginners luck with no wait.  The last 3 times we waited roughly 30-40 minutes.  To sum it up, friendly service with great food that doesn't beak the bank! We'll be back... a few more times.
