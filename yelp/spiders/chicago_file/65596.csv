Smoque BBQ////Just picked up carry out during this unusual crazy time, greeted by a group of yellow vested Smoque guys, and Henry (the dining room coordinator extradionaire)coordinates, but doesn't touch any food, only the gloved, vested food runners touch orders and bring to the car. They wouldn't take cash as it's "unsanitary". Outstanding! Please pickup delicious carry out from here!
