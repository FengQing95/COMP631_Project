Smoque BBQ////The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is because, for the price, I believe the portions are are a little on the small side.  The meat itself is substantial but the side portions are lacking just a bit.    The side of brisket chili was average sized and so were the fries but, I'd like to see larger corn bread muffins (or offer two for the price you're charging for one) and larger mac & cheese portions, for sure!
