Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Never really had Chicago deep dish pizza before. Got a personal size of Lou's specialty pizza (w/ mushrooms, spinach and tomatoes). It was actually pretty good and not crazy heavy. I probably wouldn't have it again any time soon but it was enjoyable. Also the wait staff was very nice and attentive.
