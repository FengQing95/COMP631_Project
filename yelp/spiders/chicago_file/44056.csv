Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////No place is without critique. So I'd say the biggest negative of Ba-Ba is that it gets REALLY busy. If you can, go at an off hour, your experience will be much better. During prime time hours you can expect long waits. But the place does a festive atmosphere and a nice bar, I've always had a good time even waiting for my table.
