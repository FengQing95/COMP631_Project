Art Institute of Chicago////Terrible experience with weather and fast pass.  Paid 2x  normal price for fast pass ticket to avoid my pregnant wife waiting in freezing weather and sleet.  Got inside and after paid non-refundable ticket, was informed that we could not enter exhibit with a backpack.  Women with much bigger purses and shopping bags were being allowed in consistently, but as a man, I was not allowed with my smaller backpack (which also contained supplies for my wife).  Extremely sexist and discriminatory behavior that should not be acceptable.
