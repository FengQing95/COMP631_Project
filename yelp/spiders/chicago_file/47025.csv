Smoque BBQ////I ordered half portions of sliced beef brisket, pulled pork sandwich and half a baby back ribs.  The brisket was moist, juicy and lean.  The pulled pork sandwich was one of the best I have ever tried. It was tender, moist and smoked/seasoned perfectly.  They don't put any sauce on the food, instead giving you a generous portion of sauce on the side.  Their sauce is adequate, but not the best.  It is watery and smokey.  I prefer a thicker sauce, like Sweet Baby Ray's.  I took my order to go and ended up using my own sauce at home.
