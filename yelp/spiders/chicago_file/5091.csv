The Purple Pig////I make sure to stop by The Purple Pig anytime I'm in town. Unfortunately both times I've been there were in the winter lolol. However, their waiting area was actually very cute and cozy. My friends and I were seated at the bar both times. I'm going to highlight my second time there because it's more fresh in my memory. My boyfriend and I ordered four dishes and a desert to share. We definitely utilize some of your helpful reviews on here & the waitress's recs :)
