Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pizza: I don't recall the name but we had the deep dish pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms. The pizza's layer of cheese was so thick that some of our toppings were drowned/buried in it. In addition, the pizza had almost no marinara sauce and was too dry. I literally was drinking an entire glass of soda with each slice. When we requested extra sauce, it was served to us in a half empty container and we were charged $1 without being informed of such.
