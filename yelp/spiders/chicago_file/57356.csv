Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ordered the pork paella as well and asked to add chicken too.  When our order came out, there was no chicken in it but we weren't going to say anything about the chicken not being in the entree. The paella is amazing though. It's the only thing I have to eat every time.  At the end of our meal, Hector comes back with a trio of desserts and tells us, "I realized I forgot to put chicken in your paella so I know this isn't the same but please have these desserts on us."  He had a gluten free chocolate cake, mango (or was it peach?) sorbet and a fruit empanada.
