Art Institute of Chicago////Wish I had more time to finish, I started at the back cause I had lunch at the cafe and missed all the famous works of art at the front cause I ran out of time. If I could have a do-over it'd start at the front then work my way back but I guess that's my fault. Will have to try again next time I'm in town as there are so many great works here I was excited to see. Amazing collection!
