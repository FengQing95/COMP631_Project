Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I'm not even sure where to start with this review since I'm still riding the high from the experience. We heard about Bavette's through other yelp related critiques an decided it would be a fine place to celebrate a special event. I had heard without a reservation it can sometimes be hard to get a table on the weekends. With that knowledge we decided early Sunday afternoon would be the best walk-in time. Correct with that assumption we were the first or second table to get seated. The interior is very dark yet calm. It sets the mood for relaxation and intimacy. One thing we found out before arriving was that you are allowed to bring your own bottle of wine. The only catch is that you have to give "one" glass to another table. This is hardly a setback though considering the price of drinks in the city. The service was strong right from the beginning. Our server was extremely kind and even gave us some tips on what Bavette's has to offer. To start things off we were brought two glasses of complimentary champagne due to mentioning the special occasion. I love when this happens. It adds that little charm to an already special evening. For the app we dove straight into the garlic shrimp de jonghe. The shrimp themselves were cooked perfectly and tasted delicious with herb/sherry sauce. We also tried one of the mint juleps which was well balanced. Being a steak connoisseur I knew Bavette's had a reputation for a darn good steak. We got the 22 oz dry aged bone in ribeye as well as the 16 oz bone in filet mignon. Both steaks were hands down utterly amazing !!!. The flavor, consistency, and temperature were all right there. They include a side of bearnaise sauce with all of the steak selections. I was so impressed with my ribeye by itself that I barely used it. We opted to get two additional sides which included the elote style corn and the truffle mac & cheese. The truffle mac won my vote but the corn was still pleasantly satisfying to say the least. To finish things off we splurged for a couple of sambucas on the rocks right along side the famous chocolate cream pie. I'm already missing that chocolate cream pie. Whether it be a special occasion or a reason to eat one of the best steaks in Chicago Bavette's has you covered.
