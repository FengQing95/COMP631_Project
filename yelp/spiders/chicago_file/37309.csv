Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Reservation system is beyond stupid. Can't make a reservation for a Saturday that's 30 days out until midnight.  So people who have to get up for work at 5 a.m. have to like little kids "stay up" to make a reservation 30 days out as if it's a privileged to eat at an above average restaurant when compared to couNtless better restaurants that are steps away from this place leet along going a block or two down the street.  A true joke
