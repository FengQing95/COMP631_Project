Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We had the chicken in piri piri sauce, spinach artichoke crepe, fried eggplant with feta and honey, poached eggs with ham, chorizo paella, caramel saffron flan, and chocolate truffle cake with cream. The chicken, paella and flan were SPOT. ON. Perfectly crispy chicken, evenly coated, and with a balanced flavor profile. Same goes for the paella. And the ham was the tastiest I've ever had outside of artisanal cheese and meat plates. The eggplant was far crispier than I'd thought, but still loved the flavors. The combination of truffle and cream was great, but more dense truffle than cake, which was a miss for me. And the flan...sigh. A beautiful, spotty caramel brown, with a lovely golden yellow drizzle, and no overwhelming taste of sugar. Damn.
