Smoque BBQ////First time visiting. Between the 3 of us we tried ribs, brisket sandwich, and most of the sides. We all enjoyed each part of the meal. Brisket was amazing. Ribs were unreal. Very very crowded but we all agreed to return ( and that includes our 4 yr old who is definitely a ribs kinda girl). I believe it's byob and parking is limited. Hands down a BBQ joint favorite. love that they have small add-ons too.Try the peach cobbler!!! Â Best part of the evening is coming home smelling all smokey!!!
