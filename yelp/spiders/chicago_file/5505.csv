The Purple Pig////An update is due, since it's been years since my last review and I still make a point to go to The Purple Pig when I'm in Chicago. I always come back for the Crispy Pig's Ears, and stay for every single other dish I can get my hands on. Also, they relocated since I was last here! The space is now just a couple doors down on Michigan. It has a little less character (in a residential or commercial building), but a lot more covered space while you wait!
