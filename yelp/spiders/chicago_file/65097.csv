Smoque BBQ////KT and BS were given a free sample of both sliced and chopped brisket because the nice guy preparing their order thought they should have some with their rack.  He unfortunately put sauce on the sliced portion, so it was hard for me to really evaluate the sliced brisket for flavor.  It was moist, good bark, not as smoky as it looks.  I would say above average for the Midwest.  Just don't let them sauce anything for you, but that is my policy anyway, regardless of the place and the sauce.
