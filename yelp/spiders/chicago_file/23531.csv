Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My friends and I stopped by on a trip to Chicago.  After all, you can't come to Chicago without having a real deep dish pizza.  Although my friends seemed to like it, Lou Malnati's seemed like a hyped up pizzeria.  While it wasn't outstanding, it wasn't terrible either - just mediocre.
