Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Took a client and associate to Bavette's for dinner last night and it was fantastic.  We started out with the apple and endive salad, the crab stuffed avocado salad and the duck/goat cheese terrine.  All were great and the plates were empty in the end.  The filet I ordered medium rare was done to perfection.  The pork chop was also a big hit at the table.  The sides we ordered were the baked sweet potato (maybe the best ever!) and the corn.  Everything was great, including the service.
