Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We were promptly seated into a huge, comfy curved booth and were both immediately wowed by the decor of the place (we sat upstairs); the chandeliers, the leather, the soft lighting; it was all very sexy and very well thought out. (For instance, despite the soft lighting, the menus aren't a challenge to read because there are tiny spotlights suspended from the ceiling, adding unobtrusive illumination to the table right where your plate or menu would be. We thought it was a brilliant touch.)
