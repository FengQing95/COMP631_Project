Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////So.. Not sure if the head chef was on vacation but my favorite dishes just tasted differently. The spicy potatoes were good! That was the only dish that didn't change. I was disappointed with the bread that came along with the goat cheese & tomato sauce. The croquetas had no flavor! The flank steak was blah. Lastly the Caramelized banana was ok.
