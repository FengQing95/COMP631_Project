Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Been to this popular tapas joint on several different occasions.  The ambiance is wonderful and the service has always been great.  My only issue is that I have never been wowed by any of the small plates I have ordered!  They are good, don't get me wrong.  Just no wow factor for me. Their Sangria is amazing though!
