Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////A little shout out to the tea I got with my dessert, the Georgia Peach Rooibos. I usually can't stand peach-flavored anything, but since Bavette's was a pleasant surprise at every turn I decided to try it. The tea was smoky, the color a gorgeous reddish-orange, and the peach notes elegant and subdued. As for the dessert itself - we got a lemon-meringue pie slice of biblical proportions - it was one of the best slices of pie I'd ever had. The crust, made with vanilla wafers as opposed to typical pie dough, is crumbly and dark brown (kudos to whoever managed to get it out of the mold. The lemon curd was firm and tart, incredibly delicate and not too sweet. The meringue on top was unbelievably fluffy, had a perfectly clear flavor and had been singed to perfection on top - another 30 seconds and they may have very well burned the thing. In every dish, technique seemed to be put to the extreme, and dishes were often a few seconds away from being burnt, which is always when the best flavors emerge.
