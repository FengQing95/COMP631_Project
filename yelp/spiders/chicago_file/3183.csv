The Purple Pig////I had a wonderful experience this weekend at the Purple Pig while exploring Chicago. I lucked out with a seat at the bar and didn't have to wait to be served (it was very lively on a Friday afternoon/evening). The bartender was very attentive, but did not hover and was knowledgeable about the menu.
