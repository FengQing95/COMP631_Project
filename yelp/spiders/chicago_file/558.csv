Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////There are few caf√©s that I rate. But this is some place that has to stand out! I mean, this place has awesome views, and very wonderful food! I recommend the Tuscan Panini and the fall lattes which are specialities! This place is awesome and has 15 minute waits, but it faces the water and there is much to do while you wait! This is a must eat if you visit Chicago! Enjoy!!!!
