Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I expected the pizza to be good but I was surprised by how amazing the salad was too!  I'm not sure what kind of dressing it was, but it was the perfect balance of tangy and sweet.  The salami bits added a perfect crunch to it as well.  When the pizza came out I was blown away, the cornmeal crust is seriously a home run.  I'm officially in love with deep dish pizza.
