Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou maltini's is a great place worth stopping by if you are around the area. Â The pizza crust is unbelievably amazing. Everything you heard about the food is true and even more. However, the dessert is not quite good as I expected. The tiramisu is a little bit too moist to me. In my opinion, you should definitely save some room to try different kinds of flavors. Besides, the Italian vegetable soup is great with a lot of veggies and macaroni in it.
