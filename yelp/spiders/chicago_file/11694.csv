Art Institute of Chicago////And because this is Yelp, I need to mention that the AIC is actually a decent place to grab a bite! You'd think museum food is generally overpriced and kinda gross but not here. They have a large cafeteria in the basement with food ranging from pizza to grilled salmon to cake. Their roast chicken was fantastically moist and paired perfectly with a side of roasted squash and mac and cheese.
