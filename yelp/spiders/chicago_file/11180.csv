Art Institute of Chicago////I mean, wow! Â This museum has it all. In a single visit you sweep through centuries of artistic expression in paintings, sculpture, furniture and modern pop art. But oh! I could stare at impressionist paintings all day. It's a beeline to the large than life La Grande Jatte by Seurat. (If you love this try something different and check out another life size joy Enassamishhinjijweian at Crystal Bridges in Bentonville). Plan a whole day for a visit if you possibly can. There's so much to see. Check out the Folk Art and give some patriotic props to Americana.
