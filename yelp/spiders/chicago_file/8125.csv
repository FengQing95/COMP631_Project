Art Institute of Chicago////There's even a cute lil cafe in the middle of the museum... But careful of the cafe nazi... No drinking/eating around any exhibits... Even if its Feet away and you're just taking a sip out of a bottle of water. Â All consumption must happen in the confinement of the cafe... Guess they had some real slip ups somewhere in the past..
