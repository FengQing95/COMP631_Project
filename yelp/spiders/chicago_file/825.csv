Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Freaking delicious. Extremely inexpensive and so filling we didnt need lunch that day. The Mexican skillet was freaking amazing. Huge delicious couldnt stop eating it good. Way too big for one person. We had a side of pancakes so damn delicious and pretty looking! The red velvet french toast was not bad too. But great food!
