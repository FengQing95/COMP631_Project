Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Go for happy hour and feel liberated as you order every tapa on the menu, a pitcher of sangria, and still not be frightened by the bill. Fantastic patatas bravas, tortilla, chorizo and peppers, croquettes, garlic and tomato bread (a ton of it) and sangria. Fun, very group friendly environment and great service.
