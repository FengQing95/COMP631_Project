The Purple Pig////The purple pig was a really cool experience. Everything on the menu was so different. To start, we had the octopus with green beans, fingerling potatoes, and salsa verde. Everything on this plate was incredible. There was a perfect balance of all, and I especially loved the thick pieces of octopus. They were cooked to perfection. Next, we tried the bone marrow with herb salad and Sicilian sea salt. This is what I was most excited about, as it's so different. It was really good! The one marrow kind of just tastes like a sort of butter for your bread, and the sea salt and salad on top of it were incredible! The chef recommends spreading the marrow on the bread, followed by a pinch of salt, and then adding the salad. It was a great combo! Last, we tried the milk braised pork shoulder, mashed potatoes, and puffed farro. It had a lot of fatty pieces, but I loved the leaner pieces. They had great taste especially combined with the mashed potatoes. The puffed farro was probably my favorite part of this dish because it provided such a nice crunch. Overall, the octopus was my favorite, the bone marrow was very fun and different, and the pork shoulder was the most filling. Definitely could've ordered more for two though! Was still a bit hungry after so maybe order 4/5 for two!
