Smoque BBQ////So here's the deal. You know from all the other reviews that the food at Smoque is delicious. No contest there! I especially liked the coleslaw, which tasted kinda like this Asian cabbage salad with Ramen Noodle topping. M said that my dad makes better ribs. I thought the brisket was yum yum yummy, but M thought it was too fatty. I wasn't the biggest fan of the macaroni and cheese... The noodles were too soft.
