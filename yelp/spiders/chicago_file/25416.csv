Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you like deep dish pizza, this is the place to go! Super thick and buttery crust chock full of flavor. I would recommend just getting the original pizza with just sauasage and tomato. Fills you up really well, I can barely finish two pieces of it. Prices are reasonable and overall a great experience.
