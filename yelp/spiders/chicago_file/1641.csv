Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I picked this based on my sister's suggestion.  She raved about their pancakes and I wasn't disappointed.  I had the biscuits and gravy, while she had the mexican skillet with a side of the oreo & smore pancakes.  The biscuits and gravy were wonderful.  The homemade biscuits were wonderful.  We split the pancakes, which were more like dessert than breakfast.  The Intelligentsia coffee was excellent and reasonably priced as well.
