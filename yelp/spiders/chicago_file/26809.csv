Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ate at Lou Malnati's because the restaurant can accommodate large groups and we were not disappointed.  The service was great, the staff was nice and the food was good as usual.  I ordered the Lou Malnati with pepperoni and it was great. I seldom eat deep dish pizza but when I do this is the place!
