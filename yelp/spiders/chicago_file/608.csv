Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Loooooong wait, but like the other reviews said... worth it! Come 1.5 hrs before you want to eat on a weekend, check in, then they'll text you when you're 5 minutes away from being seated. If you change your mind, you can text them and cancel your reservation. At 11:00 on a Saturday we were told a 1.5 hr wait and it was exactly that to the minute. My husband got the berry bliss French toast and I got the Napa fig omlet and berry bliss pancakes and fresh orange juice. Â Omg every bite.
