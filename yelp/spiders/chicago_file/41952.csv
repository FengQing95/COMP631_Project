Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The sangria is some of the best I've had, and our server kept a fresh bringing fresh pitchers and filling our glasses. We ordered a dizzying array of dishes, I won't even try to remember them all, but I will speak to my favorites. I ordered a crab cake special that was very good, without a doubt the best crab cake I've had in Chicago. We also had grilled squid, shrimp with garlic, goat cheese in tomato sauce, spicy potatoes, and spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms. All were fantastic. The pintxos were tasty as well, especially the shrimp and egg salad on toast. I also had bites of the braised lamb, and the beef tenderloin with blue cheese. Nothing disappointed, it was all well above average or excellent. I finished the evening with a chocolate truffle cake and espresso. Can you say "I'll have decadence on a plate"? The bill was quite reasonable for so much food, sangria, and so many people.
