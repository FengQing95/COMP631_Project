Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We love Malnati's. I don't know how they do it, but their pizza is the best in town. The waitstaff is always welcoming. The dining area is split between the main dining room with its high ceiling and beautiful exposed wood and two smaller areas that open up to Rush St. during the summer. They also have a good beer selection.
