Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Upstairs: I felt like I walked into the 1920s when I entered the restaurant. The music was amazing and the decor was divine.  The noise level was pretty low.  Seemed like everyone was whispering.  It was almost weird.  But it would be desirable if you wanted a nice romantic dinner.
