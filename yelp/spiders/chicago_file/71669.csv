Little Goat Diner////I love love this place. The service is always amazing, the prices are reasonable for the area, and the food is just perfect.  Ive been there about three times and have not been disappointed. Yesterday I got the Pork Cemitas, the shrimp and pork belly entree, and the breadsticks. Oh so delicious, all of it! It's hard not to eat everything at once.  It's basically upscale comfort food done right.
