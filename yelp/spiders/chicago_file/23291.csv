Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As a Californian ... in Chicago we had to try all the most known pizza joints and this one was one of them... loved that buttery crust Lou malnatis have ... we got the original and it was great ... loved the taste... loved everything about it. Definitely will be coming back to Chicago for all of it
