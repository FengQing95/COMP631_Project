Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So I hear LA pizza is crap. NY and Chicago are the places to go. I would concur with NY, now it was time to see about Chicago. I looked at a few places for my trip and settled on Lou Malnati's based on several reviews and ratings. They have several locations and I'm sure the quality and experience can vary, my choice was on Wells. I got a starter and a pizza.
