Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Not a fan of them, and it disappoints me to say the least. Everyone I've talked to has raved and awarded Lou Malnati's with the title of having the best deep dish pizza in Chicago, so I had some pretty high expectations going in. Maybe too high. I came here with my boyfriend for his birthday after our original reservations at a different restaurant had fallen through. Once we arrived, we were told it would be about an hour wait which I totally expect. It's what you have to deal with when you go to a popular restaurant, especially one that doesn't take reservations. We pre-ordered our pizza and decided to go with a medium classic. After about an hour, we got a text that our table was ready and headed upstairs.
