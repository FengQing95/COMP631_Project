Smoque BBQ////Went here last summer after doing some research on a good BBQ joint to hit up while in town. We took a cab here from downtown to the tune of $20, dumb idea. Cabby looked at me like I was crazy when we got picked up downtown and said where we wanted to go. Take the Blue Line, it stops nearby and is way cheaper.
