Art Institute of Chicago////Lovely, if not crowded, sites. During COVID expect wait times until full capacity is back. Special exhibits are hit or miss, but some under-appreciated gems like the Southeast Asian Arts hall are fantastic. Don't expect to see The Great Wave - it's on display like every four years.
