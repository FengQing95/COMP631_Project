Little Goat Diner////OMG! What can I say, this place is amazing! We walked in and it was a 20 min wait for a table, but the bar was open! So we sit down and Julia behind the bar greets us with a smile. I bug her for a recommendation. She suggests the Little piggy went to China. Let's just say that exactly what the dish did, took the breakfast piggy to China . The ride was unexpected and amazing. I had a vanilla latte that was delicious. Julia surprised my husband and I with champagne for our anniversary! Amazing and a must eat in Chicago. The nicest staff!! Come and see the little goat!
