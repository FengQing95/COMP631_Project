Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is definitely one of the best steakhouses I've visited. The dry aged rib eye and New York strip were both delicious. Flavourful and cooked to perfection. We ordered 3 sides to share: Brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes and also truffled Mac and Cheese. All were a hit, especially the Brussels sprouts.
