Little Goat Diner////It is hard to find a restaurant that is so good that my husband is willing to withstand the noise level to make 5 visits in 6 months. Almost everything we have sampled (and we try not to repeat our orders too much) is excellent. The atmosphere is relaxed and service is attentive despite how full the place is on each visit. Their biscuits incidentally are among the best I have ever tasted -- super buttery, yet airy, and crispy without being dry. Their cocktails are excellent, and so is their coffee!
