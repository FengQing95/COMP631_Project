Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We started with the seafood grand tower. Crab, oysters, shrimp cocktail and other seafood galore!  At $125 I thought it was pretty pricey, but it also turned out to be very delicious and I'd order it again next time. We also ordered the peppered duck and goat cheese terrine at the suggestion of our waitress and many yelpers. We're not sure what all the hype is because we thought it was disgusting and basically just ate all the  yummy homemade bread served with it.
