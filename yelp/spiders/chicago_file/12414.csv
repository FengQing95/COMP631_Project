Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute of Chicago is a must-see if you live or are traveling to Chicago. My friends and I bought the city pass and had access to this museum. I would highly recommend getting the city pass, as it has multiple great attractions throughout the city. Keep in mind, if you are wearing a backpack, it is required to wear it in front.
