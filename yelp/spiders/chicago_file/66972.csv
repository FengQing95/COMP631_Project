Little Goat Diner////While the food was good, the place was incredibly loud.  To the point that I couldn't hear my partner across the table.  And service seemed a bit off. It looked like they were training a lot of new people. They were incredibly slow with drink refills. Right before we received our burgers, our waiter asked if we wanted more lemonade and we said sure.  Our lemonades finally showed up as we were receiving the bill.  Yeah, it's minor but I would expect a little more hustle from the staff on something as quick & easy as getting drinks.
