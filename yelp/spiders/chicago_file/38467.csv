Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Intimate dinner setting and the anticipation was high bc reservations are HOT! The service, quality and experience was positive. We have tried to go back but a table is elusive. We thought ab stopping in and sitting at the bar, but for the price, you prob want to sit at a table, unless you are only in town that day:time is your only option.
