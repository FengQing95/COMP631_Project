Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First bite was ok but as I dug in it got better and better. I'm a thin crust pizza kinda guy but I enjoyed eating this with a knife and a fork. The pizza tasted very fresh and not oily. The crust was buttery and perfect! It was interesting seeing a huge sausage patty surrounding the pizza instead of the traditional sausage balls I'm accustomed too.
