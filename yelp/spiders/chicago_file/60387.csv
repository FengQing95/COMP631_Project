Smoque BBQ////Visited Smoque based on a recommendation I received from my brother. I knew it was gonna be good because his food standards are incredibly high. Long story short, he was spot on. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese and gumbo and it was delicious! The pork was very juicy and tender also I liked the sauces they provided to use for the meat. The Mac and cheese was great, it had a home style feel too it. The meal came with cole slaw as well and I will tell you I hate cole slaw but this was really good!
