Smoque BBQ////I came here with some fellow Q lovers and got the pulled pork platter with a side of fries. I knew I was in for a treat when they served me my platter of pulled pig on a cafeteria tray and then, before they handed me this dish, they dumped a full ladle of thick BBQ sauce on my entire dish. (If you are drooling on your computer right now....I totally understand)
