Art Institute of Chicago////The tour guides here are unbelievably rude. I love art museums but on school tours I am treated with the same suspicion and curtness one would expect to come from a TSA agent. I never write reviews but they have a serious attitude problem here and older tour guides unapologetically (and obviously) look down on younger visitors. Don't go here unless you make a point to avoid the tour staff.
