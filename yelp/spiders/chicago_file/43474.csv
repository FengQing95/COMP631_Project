Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went to Ba Ba Reeba with a group of 8 on Wednesday night and it was the best large party dining experience I've ever had. The small plates and pitchers of sangria make it ideal for sharing.  Mango Sangria is now on special = so delicious.  I tried a few dishes that I haven't had in the past including the calamari and stuffed mushrooms, which are now my new favorites.  And as always, Patatas Bravas are a must.  Most of their meat dishes are also good I recommend short ribs, meatballs, and rib eye but would skip  chicken empanadas & the sausage tray (blagh).
