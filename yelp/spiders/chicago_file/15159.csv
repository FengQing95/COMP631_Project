Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Very disappointed with the pizza given all the reviews. We got the "Lou" pizza which should've been a pretty safe bet as one of their specialities, and we even just got a small pizza for two of us. So there should be no reason that our pizza would arrive undercooked. The flavors weren't to die for either.
