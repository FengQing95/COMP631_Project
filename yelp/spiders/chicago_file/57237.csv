Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I am not as much of a fan as other folks but I can see how people like them. We tried their passion fruit sangria, but it was quite watered down. The best part of the meal were the albondigas, which were quite most and flavorful. The iberico ham croquetas were far too salty and Paella Mixta sorely missed salt. The beef empenada and hangar steak were both fine, but the meats themselves lacked a little flavor. I wanted to enjoy this, but its just not my favorite tapas spot. Its nice enough for brunch with friends however I probably wouldnt go for a meaningful dinner.
