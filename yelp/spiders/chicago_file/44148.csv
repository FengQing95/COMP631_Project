Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been coming here for years!!! I have yet to be disappointed! My recommendations to you are as follows: Dates wrapped in bacon, goat cheese in marinara sauce, patatas bravas, gambas al ajo, chicken empanadas, stuff mushrooms and the passion fruit sangria! Service can sometimes be a hit or miss but that still doesn't stop me from getting my tapas fix! It's great for big groups and/or a romantic date for two! Parking shouldn't be an issue they do have valet or there's plenty of side street parking on Armitage.
