Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute is one of my favorite attractions in Chicago, and I'm not a tourist. Especially in the winter months, it is so nice to walk around in a quiet atmosphere and admire the different forms of artistic beauty on display. No matter how many times I go, I always notice something that I hadn't before and learn something new. Whether you're holding hands on a date, enjoying some friend time, looking for inspiration, or just taking a break from the outside world, this is the spot in Chicago for a lovely afternoon.
