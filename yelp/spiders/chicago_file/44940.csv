Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Had the 9 appetizer platter (everything was good except the tuna and deviled egg), garlic shrimp (garlic oil is delicious!), fried calamari (sauces were good but there was too much breading), bacon wrapped dates (a must try), seafood paella (good flavor, tiny scallops), goat cheese in tomato sauce (probably the best thing on the menu), rib roast (tender and mashed potatoes were standard), bacon chorizo, spicy potatoes (one of the best things I tried), blue cheese steak (tender, the boyfriend loved it), and moors chicken (good, tender chicken in an Indian inspired sauce, interesting textures with dried fruit and cauliflower)
