The Purple Pig////Be prepared to wait in line! I went on a Saturday ~2pm, and waited for an hour. But the food made it well worth it! The service was great as well. We started out with the meatballs, and the combination between the meat, sauce, and garnishes were amazing. Though it was pricey, it felt nice to treat myself with these. I wouldn't come here regularly, though
