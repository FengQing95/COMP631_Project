Little Goat Diner////Third Tip: Parking in this area can be rough on a weekend so Uber if you can. You could probably spend the whole night eating and bar hopping before you go home so why not Uber over. If you are foodventuring, other places to hit up in the same night: Bombas, the other Goat restaurants (and the side window of Duck Duck Goat if the right season), and McD University (a novelty).
