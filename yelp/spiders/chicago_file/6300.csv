The Purple Pig////The restaurant has a really nice ambience with great looking tiles and right amount of lights. Service was great and the servers were all attentive and knowledgeable. We had the roasted bone marrow for that Instagram pictur, the milk braised Berkshire shoulder so we don't have to use teeth at all, and the honeynut squash to help balance out the heaviness of the pork dish. The rich and butter-like marrow paired well with the refreshing lime+parsley+cilantro salad (toast was great too). The soft meat and the mashed potatoes well complemented the bacon-bits-like, crispy lentils. Overall, the food was very well balanced. Would definitely come again and try the suggested wine pairing with the food!
