Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I really enjoyed the ambience and food here. I didn't love the snooty girl at reception, but forgot her quickly. We started with the delicious wedge salad, with giant hunks of bacon on it. We moved on to the bone marrow with crunchy bread. These both hit it out of the park. I wanted the fried chicken, but was disappointed to learn, it was dark meant only. Wish they has a breast in there. We had the roasted chicken instead. Juicy and flavorful. The pork chop was dry and did not have much flavor. We had the corn and hash browns for sides. The corn was great, hash browns overcooked and dry. Lastly, the chocolate cream pie. Â Fantastic ending to a good meal.
