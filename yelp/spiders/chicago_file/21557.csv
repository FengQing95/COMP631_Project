Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The deep dish cheese pizza is simply to die for. The cornmeal crust is the best I have ever eaten. The salad with creamy garlic-lime dressing is also fantastic! Not a place, however, to eat at often unless you are intent on clogging your arteries. But for an occasional treat, Lou's is hard to beat.
