Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I was here for the first time last weekend with two friends and I really enjoyed it! I definitely recommend reservations, by the time we left the wait time was up to 2 hours! The food was really good, really, really good. A few favorites were the spicy potatoes served with a delish aioli(sp?) and also the beef tenderloin withe blue cheese. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Oh and how could I forget, the sangria was really good as well, we just had the basic red.
