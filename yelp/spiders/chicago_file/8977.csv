Art Institute of Chicago////To rest our barking dogs (tired feet), my compatriot and I found a bench in front of Seurat's A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte.  A tour of businessmen (yes, all men in suits that looked like they had just left a convention of lawyers), passed through around this point.  So as we sat there, wondering if we could elevate our feet against a wall (we were channeling our yoga), this tour passed through and they congregated around the painting.  By default, we also became part of the tour.  We learned a bit, but also laughed quietly at the slightly boorish questions from the tour.
