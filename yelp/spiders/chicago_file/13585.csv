Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was prepared for an hour wait (at least!) so when I arrived and saw a small waiting area I was pretty surprised. The wait staff was definitely on their game and even took our order ahead of time, assuring it would get to our table once we were seated. After waiting about 15 minutes, we were seated and I decided to relax with a nice cold 312 brew. After about 40 minutes of great conversation and ooh'ing/ahh'ing over the pizzas at the table next to us, we were served. I went with the Lou donne with their homemade sauce, spinach, tomato, mushroom and four cheeses. My bf ordered a sausage, mushroom and green pepper pizza that also looked amazing. All ingredients mixed seamlessly and made for an unforgettable lunch. The flavors of the toppings were fresh and the cheese was melted to perfection. The crust was buttery, crisp and provided for the perfect pie shell. We had leftovers and 1 night later I was reminded of the amazing taste-fest that had taken place in my mouth before.
