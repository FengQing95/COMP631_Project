Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As a New Yorker, I am not fond of Chicago pizza, but I really enjoyed "the Lou." Â I had the individual, and it was actually quite light - no heavy-brick-in-my-belly-feeling that has me missing my NY slices! "The Lou" has the following toppings: fresh spinach, mushrooms, and sliced tomatoes covered with a blend of mozzarella, romano and cheddar cheese. The very best part, though, was "Malnati's World Famous Buttercrust" - delicious, very light and airy, almost like pastry or Cornish pasty crust. A great place for a girls' night out- be prepared for a long wait, though.
