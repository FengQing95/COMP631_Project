Little Goat Diner////Made an effort to finally try this diner.  Staff at the door was friendly but didn't ask if I would like a table or the counter.  They sat me at the counter (even though there were open tables and it was after the lunch rush).  So HOT from the heat lamps!!! Immediately felt uncomfortable.
