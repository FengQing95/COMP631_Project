The Purple Pig////The place is super cramped everywhere. We walked in around 5pm on a weekday and got seated in 15ish minutes. They have several large communal tables, seating at the bar, and regular tables. We got seated in front of the kitchen area/bar because those were the only seats left. Pretty cramped and loud but it was fun to see the chefs making the food.
