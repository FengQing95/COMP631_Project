The Purple Pig////My friends and I had both heard good things about the restaurant and decided on a whim to add ourselves to the waitlist. While we were told the wait would be 2.5 hours at our call, we were texted a mere 10 minutes later telling us that if we could make it to the restaurant within 15 minutes, we would have a table. So off we sprinted into the 93 degree heat of the Midwest summer, that enticing promise of "cheese, swine, and wine" like a carrot on a stick propelling us up stairs and with blatant disregard for traffic laws.
