Little Goat Diner////I absolutely love the Little Goat Diner for any meal of the day. I myself have come here twice already, once for breakfast and lunch, and definitely plan on visiting many more times. Part of this is because the wait staff is amazing, the food is quick to get out, and the ambiance of the restaurant is fun and well lit.
