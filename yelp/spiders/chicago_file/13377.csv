Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Let me just start by saying I have always loved Lou Malnati's, but today I had a bad experience that needs to be addressed. I called after 12:00 PM to order Lou's for my company's happy hour beginning at 4:00PM. When the woman at the River North location answered she was immediately rude to me. I do not understand why a business would hire someone with such terrible customer service. It really put a bad taste in my mouth. Anyway, I ordered my order and specified a delivery time of 3:45-4:00 So I would not have cold pizzas to serve to my employers. Unfortunately I just received my order 40 minutes earlier than I asked and will now be serving those cold pizza's to my bosses. Very disappointing, I will never be going to Lou's for a company event again and suggest that anyone ordering for their companies take this into consideration. The only thing that saved Lou's from not getting a one star was my very sweet delivery driver. Props to him.
