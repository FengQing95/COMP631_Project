Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I took my boyfriend here last night after he revealed that he's never had tapas before. WHAT?! I know what you're thinking, has he been living under rock or what? I assure you that he has not, but to ease him into the divine world of spanish cuisine and small plate dining, I decided to take him to Cafe Babareeba.
