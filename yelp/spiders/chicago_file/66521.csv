Little Goat Diner////Love this place!  I've been here close to a dozen times and haven't been disappointed yet.  I love the Goat burger, smoked fries, and goat chili.  They also do this toffee and pork accented milkshake that's heavenly.  All the alcoholic beverages are great too-Smoke on the Horizon is my favorite.
