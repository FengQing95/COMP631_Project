Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Very good overall.  We tried about 6-7 different things and all were quite good.  Red or Cava sangria were both delicious.  Recommend mixed green salad, roasted beets, oranges & goat cheese, the shrimp with olive oil, garlic, and red pepper flakes (our favorite), and the mushrooms stuffed with spinach and manchego cheese.  We had a ton of others that were all good and only one miss (chicken and chorizo skewer).  Service was great and they kept everything paced out nicely.  The Celtic coffee was very good.  Very crowded and reservations are definitely needed.
