Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The ambience is awesome! Very cool interior, with good music too! Our waiter was great, very knowledgeable and friendly. Sadly, the fries we ordered were too salty, we couldn't finish it, and the waiter took it off the bill, which we appreciated. They comped our dessert because it was our anniversary, which we also appreciated very much. The food was tasty, but we weren't blown away by it, especially for the price... Â although, the chocolate creme pie is DIVINE!!! Order it, if you go there!
