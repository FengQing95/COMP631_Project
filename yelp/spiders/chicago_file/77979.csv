Little Goat Diner////However the best thing I ate here was hands down the HASHBROWN. you HAVE to get it. It's like perfectly crispy yet moist and filled with cheese. Wow it was so good. You don't even need ketchup because it's seasoned well. If I can go back to Chicago, I will definitely be eating here like 3 meals a day.
