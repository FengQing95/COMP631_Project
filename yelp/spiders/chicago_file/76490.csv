Little Goat Diner////For dinner we split the patty melt which was just an ooey gooey mess of cheese, meat and onions. Honestly, I ended up eating it with a fork and knife because of the mess factor but I would not have changed it a bit. We also got two sides, the tempura mashed potatoes and the Mac and cheese. I looooved the mashed potatoes, just eat them quickly or the tempura looses its crunch. The mac would be my least favorite item of the night, but even at that it was great. I just prefer mine a bit thicker, this was almost like a cream sauce on shells.
