Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////But nonetheless, lets talk about the food. We had a table of 4 and we looked at previous Yelpers' reviews already about the food and a lot of folks recommended the Dry Aged Bone In Ribeye. We got two orders of that (the 42-day dry aged 22 oz bone-in ribeye) and added a Roasted Bone Marrow to each ribeye. As for sides, we all decided to share the Truffle Mac & Cheese, Roasted Brussel Sprouts, and the Creamy Spinach (or something of that nature). All of the sides were delicious, but probably the best food item of the night was the RIBEYE itself.
