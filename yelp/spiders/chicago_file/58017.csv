Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The flavors of this confused me. I felt like the greens on the plate were frivolous. They did not enhance the octopus, and their texture didn't work well make one cohesive bite. The octopus on the other hand was cooked very well, but the flavors were subtle and a rather unidentifiable. The concept for the dish has so much potential, but the execution of it was too all scattered to be enjoyable.
