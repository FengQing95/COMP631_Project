Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////When  my friend suggested tapas at a place called ba-ba-reeba.... I thought, um... but this place didn't disappoint.  We got off to a strange start - we waited for our table for about 30 minutes, and then when they called my name, we walked up and told us that our party had already been seated.  Basically the hostess thinking I was lying about having a reservation.  Apparently, some wench stole our table.  Luckily, it was resolved right away and they sat us at another table.
