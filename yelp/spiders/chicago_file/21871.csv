Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Expecting my pizza to be filled with extra layers of sauce, I was a bit disappointed to bite into my first slice and found out it's just all bread & cheese with little sauce... If you're a cheese lover, this place is the place for you. If you're a sauce person like me, the pizza will be overwhelmingly cheesy. It fills you up or you get sick of it after once slice.
