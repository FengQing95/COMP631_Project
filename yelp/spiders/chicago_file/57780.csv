Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////With all this food and a pitcher of sangria- our bill came out to around $50 so a great value and a really fun evening! Definitely will be returning. Will say that for HH we were able to walk right in to the bar and sit down but around 630 it started getting super packed so probably will make a reservation if I go back at dinner time.
