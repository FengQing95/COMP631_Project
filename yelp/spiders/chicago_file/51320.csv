Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We had couple of tapas and they were all really delicious, it's a very crowded place so I highly recommend a reservation. The only thing that really bothered me is that the host at the front table was so rude and impolite, she was behaving like we are there to get free food. I had a reservation for 3 and when I talked to her she was kinda yelling at me and then very rude way told me we have no table for you now go sit at the bar till I call you!!! I definitely liked the place but I think the host who makes the first impression of a restaurant should be a nicer well behaved person.
