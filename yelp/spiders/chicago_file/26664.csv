Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Finally came the moment we were all waiting for, the ZA! I was mesmerized by it and was very happy when the first slice out landed on my plate. It had the absolute perfect ratio between crust, sauce, cheese, and pepperoni. My eyes were bigger than my stomach and I assumed I would eat 2 slices. I barely made it through the first and was completely full and satisfied.
