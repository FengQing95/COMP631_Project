Smoque BBQ////What else can one significantly add to a place that has been reviewed over a thousand times? Not sure. If you need to know anything else I'd say get prepared for some crappy coleslaw. The the bleu cheese coleslaw recipe from Bat17 in Evanston would be a great match; they should steal it.
