Smoque BBQ////A pack of friends and I decided to meet for dinner at Smoque last night. We got so lucky that the line was not insanely long when we got there. (By the time we left, the line was out the door with 20 people outside.) I had the baby backs with beans, slaw, and fires. My friends had the half and half plate, the beef, and the pulled pork. We ate like kings! Smoque is definitely the best ribs I have had in a long time (possibly ever).
