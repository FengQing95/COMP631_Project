Little Goat Diner////Only when I cut into the toast, expecting a runny yolk - I got a whole runny, raw egg. And when I say "raw" I mean - "the whites were still clear because they had not been cooked". So now I have a plate full of raw egg and syrup and french toast that I'm suddenly super wary about eating because it's covered in raw egg.
