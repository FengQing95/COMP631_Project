Smoque BBQ////Solid place for good BBQ.  Never have had a bad meal here, though I have only had 4 or 5 of the items they have for sale.  The baby back ribs have a really good dry rub and the bbq sauce that they have works really well with the ribs.  Ask for the spicy for added kick.  The corn bread which comes in a muffin tin is great to sop up the left overs
