Little Goat Diner////We started with a range of appetizers like the baked crab dip served with Ritz crackers, cheese plates , pate, hummus and shrimp and spring rolls.  All were delicious and beautifully plated.  For our main course- there was a choice of scallops or pork shank again- just delicious!  The entire table was talking about how good the food was and how delightful the staff was who were serving us.
