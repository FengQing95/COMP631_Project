Smoque BBQ////Pulled pork sandwich, Mac n cheese, and fries are my go-to orders from this joint. There's always a line and it's well worth the wait. The pulled pork is seasoned to perfection and very succulent. You get to choose which style bbq sauce you want, which I loved since I'm not a fan of North Carolina style. Definitely save room for dessert, too... their bread pudding is phenomenal!
