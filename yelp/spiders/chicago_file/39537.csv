Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////22oz dry aged ribeye (5/5): Now this is the highlight. There were so many reviews on here that praised this, so we decided to order one and share between the 2 of us. It was just the right portion for 2 to share, in my opinion. The outside of the steak was slightly crispy and the flavoring was just absolutely perfect. And of course, the inside of the steak is cooked perfectly medium-rare and tender.
