Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is a post long over due. I took my boyfriend here for his birthday in September and we couldn't say more great things about them. We had gotten there a bit early to check out the bar in the basement. The bartender made us one of the best Old Fashions we've had while living in Chicago. When our table was ready, the hostess found us downstairs and brought us to a comfy booth. Our server was extremely patient with us since we'd never been and needed some extra time. I forget his name, but he has a majestic mustache. Anyways, we started off with the Peppered Duck and Goat Cheese Terrine. I'm not partial to eating duck, but this was an amazing way yo start off. For dinner, we both got steaks which was perfectly cooked and came with a flavorful mustard/buttery sauce. Service was great, food and drinks even better! It is on the pricey side, but I would definitely recommend for any special occasion.
