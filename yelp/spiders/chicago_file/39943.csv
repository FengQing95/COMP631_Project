Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Service was outstanding! Even though they were very adamant about ordering an appetizer, recommending the $5 upcharge for bacon for the Mac n Cheese (worth it), having another drink, and ordering dessert. But hey that's good business. I felt welcomed, the bartenders were very attentive, water was never empty, and the food came out in a reasonable time. Price was not absurdly expensive either. Steaks ranged from about $60 - $80, sides were $15, and cocktails were $14. The environment was more intimate and date night rather than business and loud. I didn't think it was overly loud like Gibson's. Overall, if you are looking for an amazing steak at a reasonable price, then go to Bavette's. I will definitely be back!
