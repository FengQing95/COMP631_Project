Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Onto the food.  I'll attempt to be brief here because, with my longwinded nature, I could go on for days outlining the multitude of ways in which they impressed me.  Bavette's has recalibrated my scale for what I consider a perfect steak and hell, my whole scale for judging food period.  Knowing I'd only be able to come once, I had to go for the signature dry aged ribeye (as did my dad).  Perfect.  Simply perfect.  No frills, just an intensely flavorful meat with the bleu cheese-like tang of a well aged, high quality beef and an immaculate crust.  To die for.  Literally: if I had to face death, I can say without hesitation that this would be my choice for a last meal. Being able to add bone marrow to any steak? Be still, my beating heart.  Judging by our noises while eating our steaks, having been rendered quite literally speechless by them, one could be forgiven for thinking they were eavesdropping on something risqué.  With the way that steak left me feeling, they wouldn't even be wrong.
