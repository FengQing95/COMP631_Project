Little Goat Diner////Got the mo heat-o. Was not a big fan. It was a little spicy. Got the quesadilla which was very good! The ambience is nice but it is loud inside so not the best place to go to talk. Definitely want to go back and check the shakes and other food out. They did not have any cake for dessert so that was disappointing.
