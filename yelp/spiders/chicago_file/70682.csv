Little Goat Diner////Since Girl & the Goat was so good, ultimately I had to try Little Goat. This is a great brunch spot that has just great food with no frills. The brunch is not your typical brunch spot and has some very cool and inventive dishes. I ordered the little pig went to China and it was one of the best breakfast dishes I have had in a while. The combination of all the flavors was so interesting and something I would have never thought of. My girlfriend ordered the breakfast spaghetti and that was alright, but a little underwhelming. The hashbrowns were awesome and so was the atmosphere. This is a must try place and I def am a fan.
