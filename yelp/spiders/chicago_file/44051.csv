Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!//// People watching is pretty good, but the service is not.  I've never waited less than 30 minutes WITH a reservation.  But seriously, you're in a spanish restaurant, so just go with it.  Pretend you're not a impatient american and just relax, eat your food and drink your sangria.
