Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I don't get why people like this place. The only thing good there is the service. The food has nothing to be excited about. It's not particularly good. I came a first time for breakfast and I ordered classic stuff like bacon eggs and potatoes. It was just OK but I decided to give this place a second chance because I thought the pancakes may be awesome given the rating on Yelp. The pancakes were even worse. The chocolate was industrial, too sweet. And why the hell would you put cinnamon in a bloody tiramisu pancake? That ruined my breakfast. My colleague had a skillet and it was not particularly good: too salty, too fat, too bland.
