Little Goat Diner////The food was amazing-it was rich but well-balanced so it didn't feel like too much. For the table, we got the messy fun fries. The messy fun fries had sour cream, some sausage bits, spicy mayo toppings served on a bed of shoestring fries (they were very crispy!). The awesome thing about the restaurant is that you can order their breakfast items for dinner too so we definitely took advantage. I think a lot of them are Asian fusion dishes (some are Japanese inspired, some are Chinese inspired, some are Korean inspired). For the entr√©e, we got the (i) Bull's Eye French toast- huge dish of French toast soaked in butter and maple syrup with an egg in the toast and topped with fresh strawberries and fried chicken (ii) Omonomiyaki- Japanese pancake but with a twist, served with a poached egg on top and (iii) This Little Piggy Went to China- chinese style pancake served with pork and a slaw like salad. The pancake dish had a nice balance of meat and greens which I did appreciate.
