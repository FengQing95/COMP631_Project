Little Goat Diner////For our meals my friends had the tuna melt and the omelet of the day, a crab Rangoon omelet. I had the los drowned sandwich. We also shared the smoked fries and the hash browns. All of the good was outstanding! I literally could not get enough of my sandwich and the crazy good au jus that accompanied it. I also thought the smoked fries were excellent, their flavoring was like nothing else I've ever experienced. My friends also really enjoyed their meals and there were not many complaints!
