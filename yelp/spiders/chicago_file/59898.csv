Smoque BBQ////TIP: CALL AHEAD for take out. There's usually always a long line so if you call ahead you get to skip to the front of the line when you arrive to pick up (pissing everyone else off!) Â Clearly not a genius idea, but you'd be surprised how many people wait in line when they could have been in and out in 5 minutes if they had just called ahead.
