Little Goat Diner////I really didn't like this this place as much as I thought I would. I understand there's a fusion going on but wasn't to my satisfaction. I had the porkbelly pancake and there was too much flavors going on and i didn't really like it. It kind of felt like I was eating more of a salad than a pancake so I was pretty disappointed. We also got breakfast tacos to share and it was really unique since there was eggs in it and that tasted a lot better than the porkbelly pancake. My friend had the Korean burger and it was pretty good just really messy to eat so be careful.
