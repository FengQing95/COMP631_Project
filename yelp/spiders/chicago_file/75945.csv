Little Goat Diner////Little Goat has the feel of a modern diner, and it seems to attract both tourists and locals alike. The menu has all the diner offerings you could want: breakfast items, sandwiches, burgers, appetizers, and supper items. Yet, all of these dishes seem to be a twist on their respective classic versions. We ordered the goat patty melt, pork belly pancake, and the Korean goat burger. I wasn't pleased that the burgers didn't come with fries, but we ordered a side of the smoked fries, and they were great. The potatoes were cut just right, and the smokey flavor was pretty addicting. The patty melt was awesome, with just the right amount of goat to bread, and the pickles provided the sourness and crunchiness. The pork belly pancake was well-balanced with the vegetables and pork belly. The Korean goat burger came with an egg on top, which was super rich and delicious.
