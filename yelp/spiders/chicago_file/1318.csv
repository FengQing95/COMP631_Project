Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I'd heard good things about this place, including their friendly staff.  So you can imagine my disappointment when the hostess decided to ignore me for a solid minute and talk with somebody who just walked in instead.  I got to overhear her tell the other person that it was a 30-45 minute wait, which was enough to tell me not to bother - why wait for people who don't want your money?
