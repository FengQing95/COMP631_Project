Little Goat Diner////Amazing brunch.  LG had a solid selection of extremely interesting and creative dishes that were classic in nature but pushed boundaries in how they were tweaked.  Crab omelet?   Unreal.  Biscuits and gravy?  Perfectly made biscuit and in a gravy sauce that wasn't so heavy you wanted to explode after.  Tempura mashed potatoes?  What a great idea!  We got there at 1015 on a freezing Sunday and sat pretty quickly but I can only assume post 1030 on a weekend you will always have a wait, but a wait the restaurant deserves and is well worth it.
