Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As my foodie tastes have developed over the years, I become more refined kind of food that I like. That being said Lou's is a place that I have been craving since 2006 when I first came and ate pizza in Chicago. It was definitely worth repeating on my whirlwind trip to Chicago this summer. The pizza is something unique. Not only is it served in traditional Chicago style, taking 30-40 minutes to prepare, but the sauce is served on top, loaded with cheese underneath. Fork and knife are required.  Plus this location has side walk seating shaded by neighboring buildings in the afternoon with a view and noise of the L-train passing by on the loop above the city.
