Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My honest opinion, is that the crust is pretty bomb and I liked the sausage a lot, but I thought the amount of cheese was ridiculous. Maybe it's because I'm lactose intolerant but I cheat for the good stuff, I thought there was way to much cheese on the pizza. Although, I realized I may be more of a new york style pizza girl. Overall, the pizza is really good, just not for me.
