Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered a small pizza, and it was already plenty for two people. Good thing we ordered the spinach stuffed bread appetizer, the 30 minute wait can be most excruciating when you're stomach is about to tear itself apart out of pure hunger. The bread was moist, and the spinach inside wasn't overpowering at all.
