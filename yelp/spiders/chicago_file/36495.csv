Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food is very good.  My friend had the steak, and as a steak expert of sorts, he was singly impressed with the cut of meat and the way it was simply seasoned, aged, and cooked.  I don't know if Bavette's qualifies as a "steak house" but they certainly do steak very, very well. He had the Chicago Cut, which we both recommend since I was able to taste it.
