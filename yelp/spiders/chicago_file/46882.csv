Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The waitperson acted like their olive tapenade was some exotic dish just brought to Lincoln Park last week from far off lands ("Have you ever had this before?" the waitress says, Yes, Sweetheart, Trader Joes has the exact same thing except twice as much for half the price). She couldn't even tell us what olives were used in the making of it...yes, usually it's Kalamata but she acted like it was "ohmigod so weird" that I started thinking maybe it was some olive I've never heard of.
