Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I loved this place. I'm new to Chicago and have been trying to try new restaurants and this is by far my favorite of what I have tried so far. I would definitely recommend making reservations. I went on a Thursday and it was packed. The spicy potatoes and beef tenderloin are must tries! Also loved the sangria! I'll be going back.
