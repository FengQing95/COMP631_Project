Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Glad I waited! Had a personal original and a Caesar salad. The salad was enough for two, but I managed to work my way through it. Very good with shaved Parmesan. Make sure you mix it up when you get it. About the time I finished the salad, the pizza arrived. Buttery crust-crispy on the edges and firm in the middle. The sausage layer was mild and delicious and was topped with cheese and tomato sauce. The sauce was tangy and PERFECTLY seasoned. Too bad I was alone, as this is the perfect place to share the experience!! This will be a go-to place next time I'm in Chicago.
