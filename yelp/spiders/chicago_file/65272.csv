Smoque BBQ////Food quality - don't get your hopes up. If you like this style of ribs and Barbecue, then these are for you. The ribs are meaty and pretty lean, but firmer than we like. The rub was tasty, although a little spicy, and the Memphis sauce was decent (maybe the Carolina Sauce - ew - is an acquired taste). The brisket was OK, but a bit dry, and it's a good thing they give you plenty of sauce, because it helps. The sides are gross, like they're trying to convince their audience that this is what good sides taste like. Don't waste your time or your money.
