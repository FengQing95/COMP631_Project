Little Goat Diner////The food however was what sealed the less-than-mediocre deal. My friend is dairy free & tried ordering the little piggy went to china. The biscuit has cheddar and there were no substitutions... seemed silly. Couldn't they just give her a different bread? They have a dairy free menu, but she wasn't excited about any of the options. Instead, she opted for eggs, toast, and bacon. They brought out the bread pre-buttered!! (That's not dairy free..).
