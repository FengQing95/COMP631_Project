Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Okay anyway, the cheese goes on top, toppings (we got the sausage deep dish) in the inside, and you got the crust on the bottom. The cheese is great because it wasn't too stringy and it wasn't as heavy and oily as it could be. The sausage was the best part. They were not cheap with their sausage. Every bite I took had some sausage in it and it was great. The crust was flaky and buttery, that won't scratch the roof of your mouth!
