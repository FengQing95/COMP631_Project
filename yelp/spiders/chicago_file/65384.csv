Smoque BBQ////Ordered on line yesterday and did the pickup ourselves.  For those of you who may be concerned about how difficult it might be to pick up, you don't need to be.  They have a long line right on the side of the building, you pull into the line--no hassle. They walk up to your car, you give them your order number and they're back in 2 shakes of a lambs tail with your order. We ordered the brisket, which was exceptional!!  Ordered 1/2 of baby back and St Louis ribs as well, and they were super.  Got enough sauce so we were happy.
