Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Service, once we were seated, was fairly prompt.  The food came out in another 10 - 15 minutes, and the pizza was very good!  I think we ordered the house special (cheese / sausage / buttermilk crust).  Even the medium is a lot to handle and we had leftovers from 3 of us (which were eaten over the next few days at the hotel).
