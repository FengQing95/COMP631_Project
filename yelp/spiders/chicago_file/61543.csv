Smoque BBQ////My husband ordered the Texas sausage platter with beans and macaroni and cheese, and I got the chicken platter with fries and cornbread. It was a LOT of food and was absolutely delicious. The barbecue sauce is absolutely delectable, the fries abundant and crispy, and the cornbread not too sweet and not too dry. PERFECT. My husband was very pleased with his meal but said that the beans were too sweet for his taste. The prices are right. I think we paid less than $30 for our food, which is all but unheard of in Chicago.
