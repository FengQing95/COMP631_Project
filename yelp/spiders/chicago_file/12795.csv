Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!  The wait was kind of long but they took your pizza order as you weight so your not waiting at your table for a long time.  They also had a thin crust pizza to try pieces off in the waiting area which was a nice touch to get your taste buds pumped for whats to come.  The pizza itself was like lasagna and pan pizza mated and Lou Malnati's deep dish was its love child! Only thing i would advise is if you are not a big chunky tomatoes pizza sauce fan it wont be your favorite Chicago deep dish pizza sauce.  Lou's is the only place I will ever go when visiting Chicago!
