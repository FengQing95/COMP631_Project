Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time having Chicago deep dish and it did not disappoint. Never understood eating pizza with a fork and knife until digging into the beautiful pie we ordered. We went with the classic 'Lou' and devoured it. Our waiter Martin was from Uruguay and was incredibly friendly. Also had my very first dirty martini which i didn't regret.
