Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered 5 pizzas. First they came back with 2 different kinds of salads in huge bowls you'd expect to see from the Olive Garden here in Canada; but without the huge translucent salad tongs. People ordered wine; we all shared - I don't remember the bottles but they were decent to say the least :)
