Smoque BBQ////It's not hard to believe that Smoque BBQ is one of the highest reviewed places in Chicago on Yelp.  My family and I went here for dinner the Saturday after Thanksgiving.  We had to wait outside because the line was kind of long and pretty busy.  Luckily Smoque supplies umbrellas for those waiting outside because it was raining.
