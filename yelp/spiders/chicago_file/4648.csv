The Purple Pig////Okay, back to the review. We arrived around 7 and put our name on the list. They take your phone number so they can text you when the table is ready. They give you a 10-minute window to get to the restaurant, so you could check in and then visit some local stores. We were just starting a second glass of wine and beer when they texted. We headed to the host stand and while we waiting in line to get our table, a woman went to the front of the line and was very rude to everyone. She was clearly angry and was saying she was in line before everyone and we all cut the line. The host handled it perfectly, telling her that she would help the folks in line then would assist her. I hope she was embarrassed because she made an a$$ of herself.
