Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The tapas themselves (when they were temperature appropriate) were good (that's why they are getting 2 stars and not 1) but not spectacular. The other reason for the 2nd star was that they had their menu sectioned off by type of meat (fish, pork, vegetable/cheese, etc) and THAT is a good idea. Â However, it would have helped if we knew what was supposed to be cold and what was supposed to be hot.
