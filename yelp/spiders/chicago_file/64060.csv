Smoque BBQ////This is an awesome place to get BBQ!  I do not live nearby but every time I fly into O'Hare, I'm headed to Smoque.  The beef brisket is what I get. Each time I visited here, there was no line and no wait time at all for food, which is great as I am usually headed somewhere farther off after my flight and I can get in and out in 15 mins. YMMV on this (last time by the time I left, a line had built up and I think at times this place must get packed).  I am missing all the fine restaurants in the city because of Smoque and I am craving it again!
