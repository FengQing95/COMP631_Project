Smoque BBQ////The wait sucked, the seating sucked. The food was great. I'm not a big bbq fan but this food was delightful. I ordered the brisket that came with a side of mac and cheese and coleslaw, even though I told Â the cashier no coleslaw was wanted. Boy i'm glad she gave me some coleslaw because it was great. It was vinegar based and I ate all of it, I usually stray away from coleslaw but it was great. The mac and cheese was some of the best i've had. The portion was small but it was amazing. The brisket was good and I had plenty of leftvovers for the next day.
