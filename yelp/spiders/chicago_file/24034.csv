Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////the pizzas were served slice by slice from the waiters, which was a little awkward for the hungry eaters at the table who had to wait for the second or third piece, and I think some people were uncomfortable to have to keep asking. luckily the deep dish slices were super filling so it wasn't too much of a problem.
