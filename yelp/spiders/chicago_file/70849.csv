Little Goat Diner////I literally take all of my out of town visitors here. I try to go on a weekday around 10-10:30 so we don't have to wait for a table. Everything I've ever ordered has been fantastic. As a southerner, I appreciate the flaky buttery biscuits. Sometimes I get one to go. I would also recommend if you're visiting and only get one shot at this place, go family-style at your table. Ex: last time I went we ordered a cinnamon bun for appetizer to share, then split the parathas burrito and got biscuits on the side with butter and honey. That way we both got to have a little bit of everything. Also, the grits are fantastic. Take everyone here and appreciate how cute the goat is.
