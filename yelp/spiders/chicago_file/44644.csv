Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Everything was great except for one thing and that one thing made a Huge difference from the last time I visited. My favorite item on the menu had been removed and needless to say I was highly disappointed and even upset . Item # 68 which is the pork ribs with the sherry glaze had been inexplicably taken off the menu . I don't know If there is someone sitting in an office somewhere making these decisions but whoever it is needs to rethink his/her decision . The pork ribs are BY FAR the Best item on the menu and the reason why I tell all my friends and family to visit the restaurant . I even told my date just wait til you have the last item ( saved the best for last ) when I realized it had been replace with a subpar choice . I asked to speak to a manager which is something I never do ( due to the fact that I work In the industry ), mike the manager came over and was very polite and professional and I appreciated his understanding . I would have given this restaurant 5 stars if it wasn't for this extremely poor choice of removing the pork ribs, but instead I only gave it 4. I truly hope someone at the corporation reads this and makes the decision to return this item back to the menu . I'm really hoping that the next time I visit cafe ba ba reeba I will not be disappointed once again.
