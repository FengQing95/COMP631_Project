Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I loved the energy and brightness of this breakfast joint, but I loved the food even more!  I went with a two-egg plate and chose the Berry Bliss pancakes as an upgrade (instead of regular pancakes or toast). The eggs were perfectly cooked to order and the turkey sausage patties were delcious!  But, oh the  pancakes....  I want to eat them forever!  They are amazing and I can see why the Berry Bliss is their signature.  Get them and start your day off right.  I also ordered a Cinnamon Spice latte and it was delicious. The person I dined with ordered the Mexicana skillet and it was loaded with all kinds of fresh ingredients!  Also, the portions are huge!
