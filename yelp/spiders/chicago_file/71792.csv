Little Goat Diner////I was aware of the Girl and the Goat, but I did not know that there was a diner-style type restaurant that featured exactly what I was looking for. They also have a location in the Chicago French Market where they sell their 'daily bread.' It's also available for purchase at the diner. The diner is located across the street from the World Famous Girl and the Goat.
