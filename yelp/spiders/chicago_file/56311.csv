Smoque BBQ////Not bad. I got the brisket platter with Mac and cheese, fries, brisket chili, and cornbread. The brisket was excellent. Not dry at all. The fries are hand cut and very good. The Mac and cheese was pretty good. The brisket chili tastes like vegetable soup with little pieces of brisket in it. The cornbread was dry and below average.
