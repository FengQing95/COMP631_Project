Little Goat Diner////Kind of disgusted, and out of time, we had to go, we'll just eat at the arena. We asked the hostess to validate the valet ticket, since we hadn't eaten and had been misled, and she was aghast - as if they should never have to do that. Enter the manager, who graciously offered to seat us immediately at some of the available seats I mentioned earlier, but at that point we were just out of time. They did validate the valet, and we beat feet.
