Little Goat Diner////I went back with my brother and his girlfriend and this time around I ordered the french toast. Their was an egg IN the french toast. I tried to order the cinnamon bun but they were out. I was surprised because it was 9AM on a Monday (they open at 730 i think), but because they are so damn good I figured they must have been in high demand earlier in the day. My brother and his girlfriend ordered something on the menu that looked great and they said it was great but I was to preoccupied with my own breakfast to take any notice. The bacon maple syrup was something out of my dreams. Our server on this visit was this really beautiful brunette who I gave an "I Love Pencils" pencil too in addition to the tip we gave her on the bill. She was very nice, professional, and well versed with the menu. She answered all our questions and checked up on us several times to see how we were doing.
