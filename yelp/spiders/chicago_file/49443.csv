Smoque BBQ////We don't love BBQ in our house, but when we're in the mood, this is the only place we'll go. The place is a bit disorganized, but it contributes to the very casual atmosphere. Wish they had a dedicated take-out lane for newcomers (you can just cut to the front, which not everyone is comfortable with), but it's hard to do everything with so little space. Overall, Smoque is a must in NW Chicago!
