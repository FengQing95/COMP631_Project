Smoque BBQ////ok SERIOUSLY this place is NOT that great.  HONEY 1 is STILL Hands down the best BBQ joint in the chicagoland area.  There lines here at smoque are horrible, they don't even have a combo of tips and links so they're makin at least $15 a pop per person. (If it was good I wouldn't mind that) They now have they're new texas sausage which is just alright tasted pretty dry. Ribs were ok. Da sauce ok.  Not crazy about there mac and cheese at all. Their fries though are GREAT!
