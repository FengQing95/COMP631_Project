Little Goat Diner////I need to say once we sat, service was fantastic!! Â I'm vegan and the waitress made a selection for me. At once the waitress found out my girlfriend was having a birthday she surprised us with a couple of their specialty cookies. Everyone enjoyed their meals and overall this is a fabulous place
