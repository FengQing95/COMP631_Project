Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////On my last visit, we were with a group of 14 people for a birthday party. We had a reservation and arrived about 10 minutes early for our reso. Our reservation time came and passed, and we waited an extra 20-30 min. to be seated. No big deal since we had a large party (with some children).
