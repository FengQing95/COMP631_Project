Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The butter crust is some of the best I've ever had. Flakey and crunchy but not too hard. The pizza in general is amazing but I just wish it was a bit thicker. I've been here a handful of times and feel like the amount of ingredients has been better with past visits. Still a top 3 in Chicago for me though.
