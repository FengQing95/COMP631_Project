Little Goat Diner////OMG OMG OMG! This was a breakfast experience of a lifetime. I somehow stumbled on this restaurant yesterday after reading a story about the chef, Stephanie Izzard. My waiter was Cameron who provided excellent service. He suggested the brioche French toast, which turned out to be the best breakfast I've ever had, and breakfast is my favorite restaurant meal.
