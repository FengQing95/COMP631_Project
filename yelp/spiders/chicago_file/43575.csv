Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went for dinner last night for the first time after wanting to go forever and I loved it!  I've never had Spanish tapas at a restaurant before, only made by my mom at home.  We shared 8 dishes plus a mini dessert between the three of us and two pitchers of sangria and it was plenty of food.  It ended up being a pretty cheap dinner for me considering how much we drank.  Even though the place was packed we were seated right away at our reservation time.  The service was good as well.
