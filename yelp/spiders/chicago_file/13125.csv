Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Oh how I love this pizza. The crust is cooked to perfection with it's flaky buttery taste. I love how their sauce contains chunks of sweet tangy tomatoes. Their cheese is the cheesiest. Every bite is a little piece of heaven. Highly recommended if you love deep dish pizza. Grew up in Chicago and grew up on deep dish. This is as good as it gets.
