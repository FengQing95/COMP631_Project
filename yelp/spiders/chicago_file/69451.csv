Little Goat Diner////Went there on Wed evening being concerned that the wait would be too long. Surprisingly, we were seated on a communal table.  We didn't mind sharing the table and were glad that we didn't have to wait.  We took our 10 year old son.  It was our second time and we loved the fact that Little Goat serves breakfast all day long.  We all enjoyed the food and service.  We will be back again.
