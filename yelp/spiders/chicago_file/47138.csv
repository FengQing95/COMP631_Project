Smoque BBQ////We've been eating at this place ever since we saw it on the Food Network show, Diner's Drive-In's and Dives way back when. It really is a "dive" in the sense that you stand in line, order your food, sit pretty close to others and go. It's a step up from a fast food place, but with WAY better food.
