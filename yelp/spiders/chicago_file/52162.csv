Smoque BBQ////Let me begin my review by lambasting that fat ass Food Network host Guy Fieri.  That guy sucks (seriously, who gives their own show a nickname?), and his show is disgusting, I hope its short lived.  With that said, kudos for Smoque being highlighted on "Triple D" (....and now I hate myself for just using that nickname).
