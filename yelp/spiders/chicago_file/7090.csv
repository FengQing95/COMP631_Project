Art Institute of Chicago////My daughter joined me, when she wasn't downstairs in children's area with husband, and giggled when we saw a series of religious sisters in veils not pantsuits. It was so Sister Wendy. Husband stayed downstairs- he said: "You know I don't like this stuff." He's more a taxidermed, animal skin, viscera kind of guy so he prefers the Field Museum.
