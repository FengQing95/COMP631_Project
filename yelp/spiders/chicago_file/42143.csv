Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The Plate Vultures circled all night. Essentially, if there was an empty plate on the table they would swoop in and pick it up. Which is fine if the plate is empty, but there were a few occasions where we had to stop them from taking food we were still eating away. Do these guys get paid by the plate?! It was annoying. Also, when we were paying the bill, I was holding it up and discussing how to split it with my friends. One of the Plate Vultures came by and tried to reach past me (I was sitting by the wall). I told him I wasn't done with the bill as he tried to reach he hand between my face and the bill. Turns out he wasn't trying to take the bill, he was trying to reach the plate on the far side of the table. Really?! Could you not wait a few minutes until it is actually clear for you to pick it up? Did you need to shove your arm across my face? Did you really have to interrupt our conversation with my friends? Very unprofessional. We laughed about those birds all night.
