Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////1. Sausage fried paella rice with poached egg (off the brunch menu, everything else we ordered was from the dinner menu): This was good but not really a paella. I mean it was honestly a glorified fried rice at best. Don't get me wrong, it was freaking delicious and there was nothing left over from this, but when I order paella, I look for that metal skillet and a crust of rice. This definitely did not have that.
