Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm no expert.  In fact, this was my first EVER experience with deep dish, which is why I'm so disappointed that it was bad.  We read every review and weighed about 5 different pizza places, ultimately narrowing it down to Lou Malnati's and Giordano's.  We picked Lou's because everyone said to.  We called up friends who are from Chicago, we read reviews that said that Chicago natives all seem to prefer Lou's.
