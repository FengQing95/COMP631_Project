Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Love their margaritas and their tapas are pretty decent too. Price is reasonable as well. My only complaint is not food related -- they have a long long wait typically, so be aware. However, if you're going with a few buddies, it's fun to hang out by the bar and wait for your table.
