Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////ORDER AHEAD: Most people tell you that you should order your pizza ahead of time.  What this means is if you are waiting for an hour, you should order your pizza at the kiosk next to the check in area 30 minutes beforehand so when you sit down the pizza will be ready.  The pizza itself takes about 30 minutes to bake so plan ahead! Unfortunately, you cannot call ahead and order but you have to be physically present.
