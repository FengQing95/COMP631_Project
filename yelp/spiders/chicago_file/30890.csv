Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The staff (takeout and hostess) were phenomenal!! These young ladies kept their composure the entire time I was there waiting for our order. They were polite and tried their best to keep things moving. We were finally able to get our online order after an hour of waiting inside, and I still had to compliment the young lady who finally handed us our pies. Great job!! You cant get customer service like from just anywhere..I mean that place was soo congested.
