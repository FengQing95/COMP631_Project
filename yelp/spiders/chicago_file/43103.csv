Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is another standby restaurant. The menu never seems to change much but always good options. I recently went here for brunch for the first time and that was delicious as well. However please note that the brunch dishes are LARGE servings compared to most of their dinner/lunch tapas.
