Smoque BBQ////You know a BBQ place is good when there aren't additional sauces at the table and that the food is enjoyed simply with what they give you. There are many BBQ places in the city that are certainly tasty but not authentic bbq, in that their lack of smoky meats is compensated with other components - sauce and other flavorings. Here at Smoque, the meat speaks for itself and their simple perfected sauce and seasonings only elevate it. It's also a good sign that their menu is on the limited side.
