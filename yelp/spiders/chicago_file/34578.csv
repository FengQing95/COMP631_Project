Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For dinner I had the dry aged rib eye and it was excellent.  The meat was incredibly tender and the rub really made the steak.  It gave it a tasty crunch while being juicy on the inside.  The steak was good enough to stand on its own and did not need any kind of extra flavoring or sauce; however, the béarnaise sauce was so good that I couldn't resist using it my steak.  The blend of spices, salt, and pepper that they give to flavor the steak, while not necessary tasted delicious.
