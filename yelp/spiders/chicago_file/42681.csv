Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I came here on a date for restaurant week. The tapas were all consistently delicious, the cava sangria was excellent and not too sweet, and the bacon-wrapped dates blew my mind. The atmosphere is energetic and fun but still elegant, so this restaurant could work for a romantic date, a big party of friends, or a family dinner with kids.
