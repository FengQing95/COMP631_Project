The Purple Pig////Roasted Bone Marrow: served with an herb salad, toast and sea salt. The server recommended we spread the bone marrow on the toast and add some of the herb salad. It was the perfect combination. The herb salad was light and citrusy and broke down the heaviness of the bone marrow. I personally did not think there was a need to add extra sea salt. The herb salad was salted enough for the rest of the bone marrow not to need any.
