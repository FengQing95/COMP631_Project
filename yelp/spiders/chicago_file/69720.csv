Little Goat Diner////YAY, how exciting that this place is open!  My bf and friend went today for lunch and arrived at 12:25pm.  The line was so long to order, but all of the staff was very sweet and helpful, asking us if we wanted to order a coffee and if we had any questions on the menu.  The menu consists of basically a few sandwich options (shrimp, turkey, beef, egg salad, make your own), bagels, oatmeal, and a salad.  The price points are very reasonable.  I got the shrimp sandwich ($10) and a couple chocolate croissants for coworkers ($4) and goat chili ($6 for small which I split).
