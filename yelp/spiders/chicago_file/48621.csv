Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Go here! Reservations are highly recommended, quite possibly required since we couldn't get a table for 2 days on Opentable. Once in however, we were in awe of all the well plated dishes. I still crave the food we explored. It was worth the trip outside the loop to enjoy a laid back eclectic vibe. It was a bit noisy but this seemed to be a popular place for group eating. There were 2 parties going on around us.. so much fun!
