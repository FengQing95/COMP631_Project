Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Simply put, the best dining experience I have ever had.  The setting took me with pleasant surprise.  The pictures on the web do no justice.  This beautifully crafted boutique has an exceptional atmosphere for a special occasion, or a fancy everyday outing.  The service was top notch.  The bar tender was knowledgable.  The waiter met a perfect balance between passive and overly gregarious.  We were seated in the basement which was by far the most comfortable room in the house; outfitted with cozy velvety grandma style cushioned chairs.  A free desert was brought us by surprise.  Did I mention the steak was to die for?  Ask for Joel as a server.  He killed it.  I cannot wait to go back!
