Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The beef tenderloin and blue cheese had that same balance of texture as the ahi tuna, but the blue cheese added yet another nice creamy and salty component to the beef. Finally, we had empanadas, a beef and chicken. Both empanadas were cooked in a very puff-pastry-like dough that was very flaky and reminded me of a dessert. It was actually a very good end to the meal because of that dessert-like pastry. Most empanadas I've eaten are usually wrapped in kind of a pie-dough, which makes the exterior not much to bite into. However, this empanada was flaky and the shredded beef had that similar pot-roast taste that really brought the empanada so much flavor. Now, the chicken empanada had the same puff-pastry exterior, but the chicken wasn't as tasty as the beef. I guess I can say it was good, but it didn't *wow* me.
