Little Goat Diner////Loved this place! We went for brunch on a Saturday, and I highly recommend checking it out the brunch was delicious. Even though it was packed (we made a reservation on open table) our server was super chill and took her time to chat and recommend dishes since it was our first time there. The iced coffee was good and in a giant cup so I was very pleased with that (love me some iced coffee). T Bloody Mary was good as well, also in a very large cup...must be their thing :) We will definitely be back!
