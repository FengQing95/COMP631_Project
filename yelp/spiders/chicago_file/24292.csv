Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered a small Malnati Chicago Classic. Made with Lou's lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust.â„¢ It's authentic Chicago! It perfectly serves 2 ppl as it is is a small pan pizza with 4 slices. The cooking time is approximately 30-45 minutes, so as we waited we shared a small order of the Malnati Salad.
