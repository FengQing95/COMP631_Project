Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is about as good as it gets for a spanish restaurant.  Welcoming and comfortable atmosphere made me feel like I was back in Spain at someone's (large) home.  Ate here for an early dinner on Sunday afternoon and the place was packed by 5:30pm.  While I really like Cafe Iberico just down the road, that place gets really loud when full.  This place not nearly as much.
