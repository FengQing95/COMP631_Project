The Purple Pig////The wine list was decent but nothing domestic??? Ibegyourpardon? I mean, I can deal with that, but I was like wuh? Severely limiting the list, but that's their choice. They had a few different pour options, which I LOVE (5oz, 8oz, half and full). For any restaurants taking notes out there, this is how to set up your list! (maybe even add a 3 oz pour for those of us that would like to sample a few different wines during dinner...?) I digress...
