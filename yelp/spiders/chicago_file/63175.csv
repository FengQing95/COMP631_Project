Smoque BBQ////We tried the chicken, pork (pulled), brisket (chopped), and ribs (St. Louis cut) and the table was divided as to which topped the list... but even the number four choice was better than just good. Â Personally, the chopped brisket was exceptional. Full flavor, just enough fat to keep it moist and chopping the brisket helps avoid those dry, stringy slices you can sometimes get off the end.
