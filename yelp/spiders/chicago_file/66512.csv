Little Goat Diner////Fantastic service. Tasty drinks. Food was fabulous. Only complaint was that I had to Google every other ingredient in the drink menu to figure out whati was ordering. I realize I'm not very hip but this was a little too pretentious. Everything we tried on the menu was fantastic.
