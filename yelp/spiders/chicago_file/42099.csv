Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Everything about this place is great.  The service is on point and they have a great variety of dishes.  You're going to want to order 2-3 items per person, and they do a really good job of spacing everything out.  It really feels like they are constantly bringing more food out right as you finish - and that's because they are.  Most important advice - try the sangria.  All of them.  My favorite in Chicago and comparable to those I've had in Europe.  Is black cherry sangria a girly drink to order on a date?  Probably.  Do I care when it tastes that good?  Not at all.  Don't miss out.  Not to mention it's really cheap considering the quality of the food/experience.
