Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We were also really pleased with the sides.  We ordered three for three people which may be a bit much since they are also generous portions.  My favorite was the brussel sprouts, which were sweet and savory.  The sweet potatoes were also good.  Then the mashed potatoes were buttery and had garlic mixed in--and were the favorite of my brother.  All were perfect compliments to the steak.
