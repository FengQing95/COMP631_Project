Little Goat Diner////So delicious! We got the reuben, fish tostadas, tiramisu shake, and full bourbon jacket. The food was all so good. Reuben was tasty and fish tostadas were fresh. Every other bite ended with "Mmm..". While we were waiting for our food, we were looking at other people's orders. If only we had more space in our stomach, we would've ordered a few more different dishes. Thanks Chicago for the amazing food experience!
