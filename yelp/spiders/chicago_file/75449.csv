Little Goat Diner////Their tonkatsu sandwich, goat chili fries and machos nachos are humongous! Their sandwiches are a little on the small side, which make you want more. Be sure to order a side dish if you order a sandwich. I recommend the reuben and los drowned sandwiches. Avoid the pork belly pancake - it's small.
