Little Goat Diner////Went to city for a quick trip & came here for lunch! Had reservations of course so we didn't have to wait. We ordered the maple bacon shake with bourbon in it (must try), coffee, pork belly with asian slaw (our fave), & bulls eye french toast! I know there are many other things on the menu but I've had them all and I just keep coming back to order our favorites!
