Little Goat Diner////I almost don't want to give away my secret to getting a table here without a wait.  But I will, make sure your entire party is present and arrive before 6pm!  For my dinner date during the week, I arrived 10 min-2-6pm.  It was like clock work as I watched it all unfold.  The once clam waiting area began to flood into a chaos of revolving doors the minute 6 o'clock struck.  The doors never seemed to stop turning as more and more parties filed in and slowly the wait began to climb from 10 minutes to 40 minutes...all in a matter of minutes.
