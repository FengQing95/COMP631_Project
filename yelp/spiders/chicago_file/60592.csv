Smoque BBQ////-The other sauce (is it called Memphis?) is what I usually go for. This is what uppity food connoisseurs hate, and what most midwesterners love: A sauce that is thick, sweet, and full of deep, peppery flavors. People say that this stuff masks the BBQ, but I would beg to differ: Is it not possible that creating the perfect BBQ sauce to complement your meat is just as high an art as creating a good piece of BBQ-ed meat? All I know is that when I lather my brisket in this stuff, I taste both the meat and the sauce, and it is a match made in heaven.
