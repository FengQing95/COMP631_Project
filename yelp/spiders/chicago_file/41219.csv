Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////What a great time and a fun, food-fantastic restaurant, good for families, large groups and couples.   From the host to the server to the bus boy to the manager, everyone here was eager to make our visit great.  The tapas are large in proportion and taste great.  The ne brunch pinxto platter was terrific, espeically the chicken waffle bites and the tiny pancakes (to die for).   All food was well-prepared and delicious, especially the spanish caesar salads, the devlied eggs, the chorizo omelette and the tiny, tiny desserts (banana and butterscotch are fantastic).   All brunch items are highly recommended.  Sangria is reasonably prices and delicious (Blood Orange flavor) while the Watermelon mojito was wonderfully strong and fruity without being overly sweet.   Our server was helpful and the kitchen eager to help with the few requests (off menu) that we had.  A great time!!!!
