Smoque BBQ////The line to eat in can be quite long.  I like to call ahead and do carry out, so I don't waste any time between when I first park the car and the delicious Smoque-y aroma hits my nose to when I get to dig in to the food.  Waiting in line with that delicious smell wafting by is torture.
