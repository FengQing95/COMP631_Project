Little Goat Diner////We had a Sunday brunch reservation.  We were sat about ten minutes after our reservation time due to it raining outside and people being a little slow to leave their seats.  The hostesses were very kind about this and kept us updated without us even asking.  The bloody Mary's were outstanding and spicy just how I like them.  I am very picky about bloody Mary's so this was a big deal.  I ordered the little piggy goes to china and I couldn't even tell you what I ordered but it was so good.  The best part was the hash browns I split with my friend.  I could have had ten plates of that for myself.  So good
