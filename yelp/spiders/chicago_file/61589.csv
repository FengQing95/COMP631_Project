Smoque BBQ////OMG!! Traveling from LA, man oh man, this was so so good. The sliced brisket, I can even begin... The meat was so tender it basically melts in your mouth! The peach cobbler was perfect, crunchy crust. I can't! The macaroni and cheese was so tasty and the corn bread was soft and a little sweet. Perfection!! If you are ever in the Chicago area, you MUST try this place! LOVED every single bite!!!
