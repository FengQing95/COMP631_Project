Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I have to admit the food is delicious!! But you don't always base a place on their food alone. Now I came in on a fairly busy weekday where you have to wait up to thirty minutes at the most for a table. This is where they got me. I walked in with 5 parties of no more than three people ahead of me. Keep in mind that I am dining in by myself. So im waiting for 20 mins and I see plenty of tables small enough to fit one person but they're not for me, instead, they are for the several parties of 2 and up that walked in wayyy after me. Finally i get seated and I get my Latte and I order my food. Another 30 mins pass and still haven't gotten my food whilst I watch as the people who arrived and seated after me scarf their food down as I occasionally glance at my waitress who is snacking on food in the kitchen and is too scared to approach because she knows im frustrated. So I resort to getting in contact with one of the employees I know from this place. She called and found out that my food had just been sitting there for a while now. I don't usually get pushed to the point where I rant like this but I cant stand lazy employees. Im only coming back because the food was outstanding. But please do something about the service. PLEASE!
