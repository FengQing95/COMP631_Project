Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I almost got turned off....almost. I knew i was gonna have a big dinner date here so i kinda saved my appetite for the dinner. My reservation was at 8pm. Being super hungry and excited to have some juicy steak i expected to be seated right away. Especially when my dinner date was on a tuesday night.
