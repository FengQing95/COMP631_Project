Little Goat Diner////C-I-N-N-A-M-O-N ROLLS!! get em while they last they make 50 a day and run out fast. Staff is great coffee is great. Patio is beautiful in summer. Pro tip- the bar in the back is same menu and full service. Corn beefed hash is huge and wicked good and I'm Irish Catholic so I can judge that. My girlfriend got the pancakes and she didn't talk to me while she ate them so I can tell you they're bomb too. Holla!!!!
