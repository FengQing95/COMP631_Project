Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////At any of the restaurants..maudes gilt etc..the bone marrow is to die for (MY FAVORITE) - and I dream about it.  Bavettes was no different.  if you haven't had it i suggest you try it out.  It sounds creepy but you will not be sorry.  We also tried the following items and everything was insane.
