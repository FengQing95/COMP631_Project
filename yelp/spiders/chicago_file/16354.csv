Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I know people don't normally go to a pizza parlor to eat salad. However, you must try the Malnati's salad - OMG my mouth is watering just thinking about it - with the house dressing. You would not repend, if you don't like olives, just set them aside and enjoy the crispy bacon.
