Smoque BBQ////This is an overpriced and over rated BBQ joint. Living off their fame from being on FoodNetwork several years ago. I've lived in the southeast and have been to North Carolina's better known bbq restaurants for North Carolina style BBQ. Smoque's north carolina style bbq is average. And wear your not-so-great clothes there because the ventilation is so poor you come out smelling like a BBQ smoker.
