Smoque BBQ////I tried the sliced brisket platter.  The brisket was good, but I've had juicier.  The vinegar-based BBQ sauce was pretty good.  Hubby's 1/2 slab Baby Backs a la carte were so tender, juicy, and delicious.  They took an extra 10 minutes to make, but they were worth it.  Since the platter already came with the slaw and 2 sides, we just split those and an order of cornbread, which was more than enough for 2 people.  The coleslaw was a delicious vinegar based slaw that had either celery seed or dill seed, which gave it a great flavor kick.  The mac & cheese was also very tasty.  The fries were the best side - freshly made, not to thick or too thin, just right with the salt, and dusted with pepper.  They taste just like my favorite Kettle Brand Krinkle Cut Salt & Freshly Ground Pepper Chips  Cornbread was extra - it's the kind with actual corn pieces.  Big plus that they have both types of ice tea - YAY!
