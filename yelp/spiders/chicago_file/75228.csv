Little Goat Diner////Honestly, wtf? I've been here twice & both times I've left with a tummy ache, bitterness & regret. 1. Bloody Mary is awful & aggressive, flavors are down right gross. 2. Chicken & waffles are so DRY & bland, with no flavor or creative seasoning/ sauce nothing to help it. It was like eating sand with flavorless chicken skin & bone. 3. I ordered a classic breakfast: eggs, bacon, sausage, toast.. I ate a plate of pure drenched grease with no seasoning or "creativity" for the price I paid. Even the bacon was just whatever which tastes way better served at publican even though it's supposed to be the same. The entire menu is screaming "I'm trying too hard" with more attention with adding random ingredients to dishes as opposed to caring about FLAVOR!
