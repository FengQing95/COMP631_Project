Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////On my second visit, I order the minestrone soup and a The "Lou" 6" individual pizza. This pizza was good, but not as special as the M. Chicago Classic. The cheese fell of the slices and was difficult to eat and enjoy, as the slices are very small. I recommend sticking to the 9" pan pizzas if you are ordering for one. The soup came out right away, it was hot and had plenty of pasta in it, not watery or light on the ingredients.
