Little Goat Diner////From the moment we showed up I was in love, the layout of the space is just delightful, bright and airy. It's refreshing to be inside, and the atmosphere puts you in a good mood. The team at Little Goat Diner was so welcoming too, answering all of our questions about what to eat on the menu. And I'm glad we asked, and I'm glad we listened.
