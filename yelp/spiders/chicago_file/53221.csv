Smoque BBQ////My recent craving for everything BBQ led us to Smoque on our recent visit to Chicago. The tiny corner shop had a line out the door when we arrived, which moved fast, but was just long enough for us to have a contentious debate about what combination of ribs/brisket/pork and sides to order. If only they offered an "everything" sampler!
