Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Amazing!  Crust was buttery and crispy.  Toppings were spot on.  Sauce was vibrant and fresh.  Ingredients were outstanding!  Could not get enough of it.  Service was fantastic but lacked the ambiance of Uno.  Easily the best we had in Chicago. If you're only going to do one deep dish place. This is it! Just keep in mind the sauce is not pizza sauce, just the freshest tomato sauce you will try.   Sausage flavor is truly unique.  We will continue to orders their pizza delivered to Oregon forever!
