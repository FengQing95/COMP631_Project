Little Goat Diner////I came to little goat for Sunday brunch without a reservation..risky I know! The wait was almost 2 hours BUT we walked into the bakery/bar area which is open seating and were lucky enough to snag a table! There's only 4 or 5 small tables in this area so it's a little tight but we were starving and so glad we didn't have to wait! I would definitely recommend making a reservation in advance but even a 2 hour wait would be totally worth it.
