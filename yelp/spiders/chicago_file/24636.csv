Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I had my first Chicago style deep dish pizza here last night. For appetizer we got the Three Cheese Bread. It's garlic French bread with three cheese and came with three dipping sauces (artichoke dip, hummus, and garlic sauce). The bread was very crunchy and had dices of tomato. My favorite dip was the garlic sauce for sure.
