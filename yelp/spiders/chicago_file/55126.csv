Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////From the general menu, there are many amazing dishes. I've had almost every dish from the vegetarian and seafood sections. My favorite vegetarian options that I haven't already mentioned are the burrata, potato & onion omelette, and goat cheese baked in tomato sauce. For seafood, I strongly recommend the grilled octopus, shrimp with garlic, and fried calamari.
