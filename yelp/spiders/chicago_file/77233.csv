Little Goat Diner////The food: it was great. I would be giving this place 5 stars if it was based solely on the flavor, selection, and quality of the items offered. I decided on the Fat Elvis Waffles, and they were fantastic. Our group also got the PQM bacon (nothing really special or unique for a $6 side of bacon), hash browns, and the Pork Belly Home Fries. The home fries were very good, the aoli it came with complimented it very well. Although, there were only about 3 small cubed pieces of pork belly for the dish, which was not enough. I wanted to try the cinnamon roll, but they were unfortunately out.
