Little Goat Diner////Bi bim bop - cauliflower rice, fancy bacon (what the waitress called it), a fried egg, asome other stuff. I thought this was way too sour. There were bean sprouts, pickled purple cabbage, and mushrooms in it as well. I also didn't think there was enough bacon in it to say it had bacon in it on the menu.
