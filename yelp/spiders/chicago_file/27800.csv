Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The server was polite, however she was at times distracted and forgot about check ins and drink refills. That would be my only negative. The pizza was fantastic.. no survivor slices were spared. If you decide to visit this location, prepare to drive and find a parking garage unfortunately.
