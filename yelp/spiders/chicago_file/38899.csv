Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great meat experience in an atmosphere if a trendy bar. Good selection of cocktails. We each ordered an entree and sides to share. The dry rubbed aged ribeye was amazing. This place is pitch dark ! Hard to read menu and even enjoy the ambience because it is just too dark. But restaurant itself is romantic and very cool. Best steakhouse in a amazing steakhouse area of Chicago.
