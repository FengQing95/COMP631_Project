Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Those lamb chops were, hands down, the best I've ever eaten. And I've eaten many a lamb chop. Not crazy about the corn, the waiter comped it, and promptly brought out some mashed potatoes that were the height of garlicky, creamy perfection. Incredible meal, be sure to make a reservation far in advance.
