Art Institute of Chicago////My comments are no different from the average lover of works from master painters. The Monet's, Van Gogh's and Seurat's are a sight to behold. All of the paintings by those artists left me very emotional. In a word amazing. That said, though the institute does an amazing job of organizing them. If that's all you want to see, it's an easy walk and your there in minutes. I only had 3 hrs and I saw all that I wanted an little more because it was so easy to get from room to room. Â Admission is relatively inexpensive and so much value.
