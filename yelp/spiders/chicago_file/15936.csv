Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I usually avoid chains when traveling, but since this is a Chicago-based chain and I was staying on the Loop, I decided to try this out after a showing of Book of Mormon.  We arrived just before closing and immediately ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic since it takes about 30 minutes to bake.  No waiting for a table if you get there 30 minutes before closing on a weeknight.
