Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Went there expecting a great Chicago deep dish pizza, I got a over-cooked piece of dough with tomatoes and cheese. Also, no one decided to tell me and my family that the pizza would take 50 minutes to come out. (There is a preorder option but we were not aware of the 50 minute wait) After all the hype for the pizza, we weren't the biggest fans. To make it even better, the sausage was grey and didn't taste like anything. We also ordered a thin crust pizza which had a soft crust. Couldn't even bend it. All in all, not worth the hype.
