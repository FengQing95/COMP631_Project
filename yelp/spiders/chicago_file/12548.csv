Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We stopped in to have dinner at Lou Malnati's before we left Chicago. We arrived before the dinner rush probably around 5:30 and were seated right away. I would highly suggest this because by a little after 6pm the place was packed and people were waiting for tables. Since we had never tried deep dish in Chicago we went with the house specials thinking that had to be the best bet. Our salad came out and it was very fresh and tasty. The serving sizes are printed on the menu which is helpful and we found them to be very accurate. The let us know that the pizzas are made to order and it is about a 30 minute wait from the time your order until they bring you your pizza. We didn't have a problem with this because we like fresh food and if you order drinks or a salad the time goes by fast. I'm not a deep dish expert and I admit that I do tend to like thin crust pizza so I thought the pizza was okay. The crust and sauce are very sweet so if that is an issue for you I'd suggest getting bolder toppings to help balance that out. The service was very good and we never had to ask for our glasses to be filled or find someone to get us something we needed. The place is also clean and has a great atmosphere to enjoy a casual dinner in. I think it was a great experience and I'm glad we tried it, but it wasn't enough to make us crave it past that.
