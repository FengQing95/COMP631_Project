Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is a great date spot. It's romantic warm atmosphere with delicious food and cocktails is always dependable. I love their Lillet Rose martini and Prime Beef French Dip Sandwich. Service is always excellent. You can dine on their outdoor patio or interior bar/dining room. They are 100% cash less and cannot break change if you want to leave cash tips for wait staff.
