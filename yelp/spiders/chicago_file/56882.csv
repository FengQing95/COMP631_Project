Smoque BBQ////We have been going to Smoque for years and will say UNEQUIVOCALLY this is GREAT BBQ!! Honestly, I have tried every single item on the menu and it is everything you'd expect great BBQ to be. Low and slow beef brisket melts in your mouth. Ribs of either kind (baby back or St. Louis) are seasoned so well they don't need sauce. I don't particularly care for hot links (Texas sausage) but even those are spicy and good. Prepare to wait in line during main dining hours, trust me it's worth waiting for. Inside tip, be nice to the bus staff-they are your ticket to getting a table quickly.
