Little Goat Diner////Great menu with lots of delicious-looking choices. I got the Chop Chea "burger" which is glass noodles and a burger (without the bun) with an egg and with kimchi and other veggies. Definitely unlike anything I have had before, and I loved it! The atmosphere is fun, decor is beautiful...great place for a small group 3-6. Drinks are a little higher - but are priced like other restaurants in West Loop. Would definitely go back to try their other plates.
