Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I like pizza a lot. Pretty much anything that has bread and cheese will make me happy. Â I usually am partial to my favorite Gino's East, but my bf wanted to try Lou Malnati's. I had only been to the location in Naperville a couple of years ago, so I was game for trying the downtown location.
