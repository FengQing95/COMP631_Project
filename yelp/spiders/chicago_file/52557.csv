Smoque BBQ////I never blame a place for being popular, but Smoque is too small (a picture taken in January clearly illustrates this). It can seat about 20 on the left, and about 40 on the right, but the tables and chairs are really close to each other. It's hard to move around when the place is busy (this is an understatement), and you may also find yourself waiting to be seated (there are some chairs by the restrooms, and people were constantly walking by my wife and I).
