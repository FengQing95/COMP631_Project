Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Solid breakfast stop. However, I think the pancakes are over-rated in these reviews. Also had The Garden skillet dish which was good but not great, the asparagus was tough and chewy.  My husband  had the veggie wrap which he liked and would rate a 4 out of 5 stars.  The employees are friendly and efficient.  We arrived at 9 a.m. on a Sunday and were seated after 15 minutes which was fine. When we left, there were lots of people standing around waiting.  Not worth more than a 15-20 minute wait.
