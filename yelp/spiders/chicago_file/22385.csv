Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place gets packed and for good reason too.  The pizza is amaze balls.  Fret not though, if you have to wait for a table they will let you order your pizza while you are waiting.  I really like this because it comes out to the table at almost the same time you sit down.  They have really got their stuff together on this one.
