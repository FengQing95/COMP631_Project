Little Goat Diner////The food was delicious, creative, & huge portions! But over priced for "diner" food. Tried the bullseye french toast & Los drowned sandwich- both very good- the kind of good that puts a smile on your face. Also tried the hash browns with goat cheese- just okay, nothing to write home about.
