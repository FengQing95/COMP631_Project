The Purple Pig////(++) Assortment of locally foraged mushrooms ($15): In my mind I had the image of a purple pig on a leash foraging for truffles and rare mushrooms. While the mushrooms where less bouge than truffles, it was a satisfying dish with the variety of succulent mushrooms. The hearty, earthy taste paired with the tart (purple!) berry sauce was a subtle surprise.
