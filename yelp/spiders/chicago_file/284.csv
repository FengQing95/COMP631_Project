Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Saturday morning around 9am, got right in, and proceeded to have a mouth-watering breakfast with delicious lattes! My husband and I had the Corned Beef Benny and the Garden Skillet. The skillet decision was swayed by our waitress and I am so glad I did! The perfect combination of veggies, hashbrown, and I had a crepe instead of a pancake. The best of all worlds. My husband had the Corned Beef Benny and said it was delicious.
