Little Goat Diner////A very cute casual dining spot in West Loop. Just look for the spinning baby goat on the roof! You gotta love places that serve breakfast all day long because sometimes you just can't get it together in the morning and then brunch is over! Biscuits and Gravy is to die for! The gravy is creamy and meaty and biscuits are very fluffy and hot. Order a side of maple sausage links and you'll be good to go until dinner time!
