Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I think I've been here and ordered bacon wrapped dates more than any other dish from any restaurant in Chicago. Their sangria is amazing too. I order a pitcher of sangria every time and I don't even like alcohol. I honestly have never eaten a dish I didn't like here though. Besides the dates I definitely recommend the platter, the spicy potatoes, and the calamari.
