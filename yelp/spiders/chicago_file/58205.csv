Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Food and drink wise, their fall sangria was so good. Their patatas bravas, some of the best I've had. The potatoes were so well seasoned and the sauce... ugh, amazing. Shrimp & grits... life changer. Those three things were honestly the show stopping, jaw dropping items. Their flavors were so on point and so delicious I could've eaten them twice.
