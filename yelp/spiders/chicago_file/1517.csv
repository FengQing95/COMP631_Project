Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////We came here for breakfast twice in one week and so I have not even considered the lunch or sandwich options.  And why should you?  The sheer amount of food will satisfy even the hungriest of patrons.  Yes, you get a shortstack of pancakes with your skillet meal - savory and sweet all in one sitting without having to divide your loyalties.  Our wait was about 10-15 minutes on medium-busy morning.  Service was Midwestern-friendly and disarming to us East-coasters.
