Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////A few standout menu options include the charred octopus with bone marrow and lemon and the market greens salad with pumpkin seeds and grapefruit. And the coconut flan. My god, the flan. I'm not a big dessert person, and particularly not fond of flan, bit this is really top notch. Highly recommended.
