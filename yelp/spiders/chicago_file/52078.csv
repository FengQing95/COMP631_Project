Smoque BBQ////i've had a lot of friends tell me that i have to try this place. specifically, i've had a few rave to me about their chili, because i'm a chili junkie. they went on and on about the brisket chili. so, i decided i'd ride shotgun one day to check it out. first off i have to say that the chili totally underwhelmed me to the point that i thought it was just ok. i had expected so much more from all the raves. that being said, i sampled some of the saint louis style ribs (fantastic), went on to the brisket sandwich (damn good), and had the mac Â cheese (just about as good as my wife's and that is saying a lot) and fries (tasty) on the side.
