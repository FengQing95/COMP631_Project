Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I finished the pizza without leaving the crust. This pizza took the crown because I actually ate their crust, unlike the others. Their crust taste like a grade A butter bread. The price compared from their competition is unbeatable also; for only $16+ a small deep dish pizza that can serve 2 people is unheard off. Overall, I would come back to this city just to eat here.. that is how awesome it is :)
