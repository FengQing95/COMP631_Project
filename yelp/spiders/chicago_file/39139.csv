Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It had been a long while since I'd dined at Bavette's, having moved out of Chicago, but my return to it last night made me remember why it is my favorite restaurant in town. The ambiance, the food, and the impeccable service from Michael the bartender, allowed me & a long time friend to have one of the best nights ever. I didn't anticipate the bonus of fantastic conversation, wine tastings/pairings, drink lore, and a surprise sparkling dessert that ended a perfect evening - and yet Michael delivered all of these things as he smiled behind his bow tie. Well done, Sir! Well done! I love this place.
