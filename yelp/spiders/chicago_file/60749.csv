Smoque BBQ////The place is a bit cramped, and their system for organizing who sits when is effective and charming. However, I have not sat down to eat at Smoque for some time, preferring instead to phone in my order and skip the occasionally long line. It also is not a place to linger, unless you want to heartlessly deny barbecue goodness to the people in line.
