Little Goat Diner////Most importantly, the food.  I ordered a cinnamon sticky bun, which was hot, gooey, sweet, cinnamony, and generally delicious.  It wasn't a giant Cinnabon style pastry that you eat in shame at O'Hare because your flight is delayed and it's too early to start drinking, but I wasn't looking for that any way.  It was very good.  The corned beef hash?  Bland.  Maybe it's just my demanding taste buds, but I had to dress it up with plenty of hot sauce, ketchup, and salt & pepper.  When I used to smoke, I thought that I really liked overly salty and spicy foods because my taste buds were dulled from smoking.  I guess I was wrong.  The corned beef lacked the saltiness that I expect from corned beef.  The potatoes were cooked right, but rather tasteless.  The eggs over easy on top were done right.  The portion was very good.  I was definitely full.  I'll return to Little Goat to try other menu items, but the first impression didn't set my pants on fire.
