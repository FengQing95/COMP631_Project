Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////After hearing about this place for such a long time and trying to come many times I FINALLY MADE IT. Stopped by the day after Thanksgiving to have lunch with my family. The four of us ordered squash soup ($5), brussel sprouts salad ($7), the cheese plate($10), garlic shrimp ($9.50), squid ($11), beef empanada (6.50), hanger steak ($13), lamb skewer ($9), and we two desserts - chocolate truffle and Spanish affogato. There's free dessert with your yelp check-in!
