Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great deep dish pizza that's very comparable to Giordano's but for me it's a tad better because of the Minalti classic with the lean sausage patty underneath the sauce and cheese and the better crust is tastier that Giordano's. But to be honest you couldn't go wrong with either of these options.
