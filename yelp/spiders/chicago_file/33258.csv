Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband and I moved to Chicago just over a year ago and vowed to try out a ton of restaurants.  We stumbled upon Bavette's early on, and we have gone back numerous times--so much so that we have hardly tried any other restaurants!  We love the ambiance, and the food and service are excellent.
