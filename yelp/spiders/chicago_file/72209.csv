Little Goat Diner////Atmosphere is cool, as you'd expect. Long Island had an odd taste and by far not the best I've had around. The nachos....yep, they are as freaking amazing as everyone says. So much so we wanted to take the scraps left on the plate home with us...which you just never do with nachos (do you?)
