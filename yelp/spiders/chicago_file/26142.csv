Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We're from California and we're in Chicago so we didnt really have a choice but to have deep-dish pizza while we were here.   I ordered the special and my fiancé built his own.  As expected, the pizza was good and markedly different from all California pizza.  We also had their version of a pizookie which was also expectedly delicious.  Staff were very courteous and attentive as well.  TBH I have nothing to compare this pizza too, but I'm glad we came here to try the infamous pizza of Chicago.
