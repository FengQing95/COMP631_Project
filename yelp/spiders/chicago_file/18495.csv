Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've reviewed 'burb locations where we usually get delivery.  I took my sister to this location when she came into town from L.A.  Good ambience, busy but not tourist circus-y.  We've timed our visits well, other friends have told us it can get packed.  Be prepared to wait 35-40 minutes for your pizza.  Sis liked the pizza so much we visited the Schaumburg location before heading to the airport.  LOL.  The rest below is copied from my other Malnati review.
