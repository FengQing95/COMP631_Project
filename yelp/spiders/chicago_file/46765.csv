Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My dad could not get enough of these.  I've had the same dish at other places, but this one is the best version I've tasted.  Again, the taste and texture contrasts between the bacon and the date were absolutely divine.  I was lucky to grab two before my dad put this dish away in his stomach.
