Smoque BBQ////Pretty much lives up to the hype. Spare ribs are well-smoked yet still nice and juicy. Best brisket in town bar none. Barbecue chicken is at the top of my wife's list, and she's picky about her chicken. Links are fine ground meat without the fillers found in many versions (which barbecue tradition considers acceptable but Smoque chooses not to go that route anyway). Some of the best fries in town and the rest of the sides are generally delicious. The only knock I can think of is that the side portions other than the fries are small. People complaining about the lack of ambiance apparently don't "get" that bare-bones decor is part of the "barbecue shack" tradition. You're there to eat great food, not look at pretty walls and curtains and crap.
