Little Goat Diner////Woo-hoo -- what a great diner! We sampled Little Goat for a weekday brunch and had a great time all around. The space is airy, light and upbeat. The staff is very well-trained (seems to be a hallmark of BRG Group restaurants -- good job!). Everyone was congenial as can be -- even the bussers made witty conversation!
