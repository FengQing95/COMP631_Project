Little Goat Diner////Me & my peeps were hungry after some serious hours of drinking and then we realized a friend of ours worked @ Little Goat as we were already down the street @ that dreaded Market. Â We walked in and were greeted by the nice staff and shown to our seats immediately. This place is basically a diner to say the least, but its definitely a break from the swanky restaurant/bar scene on this strip.
