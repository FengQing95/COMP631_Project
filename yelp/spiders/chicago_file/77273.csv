Little Goat Diner////When I first found this place I saw some people say the service isn't great but the food is. I'm not an old baby booming grouch so as long as they come by a few times and are nice I don't care. I don't need to be sucked dry to consider something good customer service. These people work their butts off and I had to make a reservation for a diner so yeah it's poppin. My waiter was nice and the food was so good. I highly recommend it and now every time I come back to Chicago I'm eating here.
