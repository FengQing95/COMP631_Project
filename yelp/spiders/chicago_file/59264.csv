Smoque BBQ////I made my first trip to Smoque in the middle of a lazy Sunday afternoon.  A nice drive on a 50 some odd degree sunny day with the windows down definitely set the mood.  We found parking easily on the street just west of Pulaski.  The air on the walk over was infused with the barbecue flavor; it was then that I wished I was able to take a picture of an odor.
