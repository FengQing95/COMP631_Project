Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I don't understand how this place doesn't have a five star! I've been to every steakhouse in Chicago, and Bavettes is by far the best Chicago's Steak house. Their cocktails are amazing. Their appetizers are wonderful. The sides are complementary to the steaks. But their bone in ribeye and bone in fillet are out of this world.
