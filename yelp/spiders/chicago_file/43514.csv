Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tortilla espanola, curried chicken salad (I never would have tried it without my friend's recommendation, but I'm SO glad I did), spicy potatoes with tomato aioli, seared scallops with raisins and couscous, rioja short ribs with mashed potatoes (melt-in-your-mouth!), beef empanada, and the roasted dates with bacon. Â I've had other selections here that have been wonderful, but these are my go-to items.
