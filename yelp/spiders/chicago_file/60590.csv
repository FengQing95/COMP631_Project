Smoque BBQ////Fries: The reason I give this place a 4.5 and not 5. Okay, they're pretty good fries, but if you're gonna go to the trouble of eating one of the most unhealthy things on the planet, why not season it up a bit? I like that there are places popping like Edzo's Burger Shack that doll up the fries. But maybe it's just that I don't really see the point in plain fries...
