Little Goat Diner////I loved this place!  I ordered the Bi Bim Bop Breakfast Bowl and it included the hands-down tastiest eggs I've ever tasted in my life.  Everything was delicious.  I have multiple food allergies which can give me anxiety when I go out to eat, but the staff here was extremely thoughtful and attentive to my needs and I felt very safe eating here.
