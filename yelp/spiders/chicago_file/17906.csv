Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Order your pizza as you arrive and put your name in for a table. Approach the bar and see who's ready to go. If you get bar seats you can have your pizza there (salad has to be ordered at the bar or table, not front desk, but it's fast). If you get a table, at least your wait is not twice as long (because a deep dish pizza takes about 40 min to be ready).
