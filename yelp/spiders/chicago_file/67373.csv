Little Goat Diner////- Kalbi Ribs - Came with 3 sets of Kalbi. The ribs were cooked fine, probably under-marinated because there wasn't a whole lot of flavor in the meat. The dirty rice it came with carried a great crispy texture but was a little too salty. The dish came topped off with crispy onions, strawberry, and zucchini squash which took the edge off the salty rice and actually brought the different elements together. A solid if not inspiring serving.
