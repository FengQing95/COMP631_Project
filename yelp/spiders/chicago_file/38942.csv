Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Heads up, Bavette's Las Vegas...we are headed your way this weekend and really hoping it's 2 for 2!! I'm generally somewhat ambivalent about the Las Vegas outpost dining scene, feeling that too often no one is really paying attention due to the high volume turnover. I'll admit it, I'm still scarred from an horrific experience a decade ago at a Batali-owned joint after a stellar one at Mozza in LA. But I digress. Fingers crossed and dreams of sourdough and Gorgonzola dancing in my head...
