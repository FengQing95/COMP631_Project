Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The most amazing pizza I have ever had!!  I have always heard and seen on TV that Chicago deep dish was the best...I now believe it wholeheartedly!  I don't know how the crust can be so good with so much stuff in the pizza!  We had the house salad as well and it was also delicious.  I can't think of a single reason to not come here.  I hope hope hope that I can come back someday!
