The Purple Pig////- Milk braised pork shoulder $19- the pork was the most incredibly tender, moist, and perfectly seasoned piece of pork I have ever had. The mashed potatoes underneath were so smooth and tasted like air. It also had these crispy bits of pork? that really added to the dish. It was remarkable how the chef was able to capture so many flavors and different textures in that dish. It was a very memorable dish and one that I would definitely get again 5/5.
