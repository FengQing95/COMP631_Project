Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The locals suggested this spot, so we decided to see what's good about it. Since the place was busy, we immediately voted to sit at the bar. The service there was ok. The bartender had a little too much on his plate and was rather slow making his rounds to us. The food was delicious. We had a Bloody Mary, Buffalo Wings, and their house deep dish pizza. Everything exceeded our expectations except for the fact that our pizza took about Â an hour to come out. That's the only reason why I can't give them 5 stars. Don't know if the bartender forgot to put the order in, but the guy next to us got his pizza in about 20 minutes. You make the call
