The Purple Pig////The broccoli may not sound like anything special but it was really delicious. The sauce that they put on it makes it stand out. The bone marrow that they gave had generous portions and they refilled our bread as well. The fried pig ears comes with kale and an egg on top. It may sound a little scary to be eating pig ears but it honestly tastes more like fried chips. And besides you can never really go wrong with anything that's fried.
