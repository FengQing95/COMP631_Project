Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They have a great garlic butter crust that really compliments their pizzas. Their deep dishes tend to be more shallow but with excellent quality toppings. The veggie pizza and traditional chicago are my 2 favorites. The downtown location makes it easy to access by public transit and walking. They have a reasonable happy hour as well. My friends who I took here for their first time really loved the restaurant too.
