Little Goat Diner////If there's any knock I would give it would be to skip the alcoholic drinks. My buddy and I ordered mixed drinks at the sidebar attached the restaurant as we were waiting for our table and both drinks were underwhelming and overpriced. Also for dinner, I felt that the beers we had were also overpriced.
