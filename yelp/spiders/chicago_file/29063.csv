Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If this is your first time trying deep dish from the area, be prepared to wait 30-45 minutes for the pizza because that is how long it will take for the pizza to be made. As a New Yorker, I was not used to that long of a wait for pizza because in New York, you can get your pizza within seconds to minutes of ordering.
