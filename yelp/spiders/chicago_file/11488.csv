Art Institute of Chicago////As Chicagoans, we are lucky to have this enormous museum of different styles of art available in a convenient spot with a very reasonable admission price (and free on Thursday evenings!). With rotating exhibits that cover everything from ancient Chinese artifacts to architecture to armor to quilts and more -- the art available to enjoy changes frequently.
