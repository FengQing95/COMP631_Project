The Purple Pig////We ordered the octopus, roasted bone marrow with herb, and shrimp toast. The octopus was drenched in oil and pesto, and came with potatoes and asparagus. The shrimp Â was actually plated on chorizo instead of bread, which was an interesting touch, whereas the bone marrow was served with a side of salt and cilantro. I found everything, including the wine we ordered, to be absolutely savory and delicious. We had a fantastic time; the food was beyond-words amazing, and the atmosphere was lively and warm. What a great spot!
