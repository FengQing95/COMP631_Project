Little Goat Diner////Even for Sunday brunch, I think we lucked out because we didn't have to wait any more than 15 minutes. We even scored our own booth! Nothing against the communal tables, but it's awkward sitting next to your dining partner and if you sit across from them, you're subjected to everyone's conversations. Since I was catching up with a friend, I was really grateful for our table.
