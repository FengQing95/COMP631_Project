Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////On my most recent visit we got a pitcher of Sangria, the appetizer sampler, and a paella loaded with all sorts of meat. I've got to say, the meat paella was significantly better seasoned than the seafood paella I had had previously. With that said, it's difficult to decide which is better, so I guess you should just try both!
