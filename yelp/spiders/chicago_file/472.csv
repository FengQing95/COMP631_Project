Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////There was quite a long wait to get a table but we decided to give it a shot. They gave us a buzzer and told us that it would take about 45 minutes. Since it was a good long wait, we decided to take a stroll. The buzzer automatically started ringing when we went out of range. Misinterpreting it as a call for our table we rushed back, but it was not even close. After about an hour we were lead to our table. Our exasperated faces read "this better be worth it" and our wishes came true instantly. We ordered fresh fruit juices to start with. Our waiter was super polite and explained us the menu options. Â We were told that for a dollar paid in addition for our omelette we could avail one of the specialty pan cakes as well. I got a "Fresco" which was basically a veggie with basil, sun dried tomatoes and provolone cheese. It was delicious but just way too big for me to fully get through with. My friend got a bacon omelette which he said was pretty good too. Our pancakes were really rich with honey/ maple syrup and well made. In addition it came with fresh fruit. I got boxes for the left overs and paid up. The entire meal just costed us a little over 15 bucks/ head. Definitely gonna come back here. And the long wait was definitely worth it !
