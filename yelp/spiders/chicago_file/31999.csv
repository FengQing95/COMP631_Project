Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's Pizzeria is one of the most famous ... and popular ... Chicago pizza joints. The usual 40-minute wait works out because it gives diners a chance to order (after checking-in) so that pizzas are ready when getting seated. We lucked into only 5-minute wait, so, we got some drinks and hung out at one of the upstairs tables.
