Smoque BBQ////This might be the unicorn of reviews for this establishment but it's honest. I saw Smoque featured on the Food Network and told my family we had to try it. There was 10 of us, and we had a big table. The staff was really attentive. The food was just okay. I was not impressed with the barbecue. The ribs were okay. The seasoning was bland. Mediocre at best. Honestly just drive to Kansas City, Tennessee or other barbecue capitals to get the real stuff. Chicago should just stick to the pizza, beef and hot dogs, and leave the barbecue to the pros.
