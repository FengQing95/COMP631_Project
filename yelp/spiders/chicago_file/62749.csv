Smoque BBQ////I finally ate at Smoque after several tasty take-out orders. It was a Tuesday evening but the line was pretty long, but did not extend out the door. The ribs taste even better on the premises! Someone will ask if you are dining in or taking out, and will point out an empty table for you. We left a bit after 8PM (they close at 9PM) and the place was still crowded.
