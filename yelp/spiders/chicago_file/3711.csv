The Purple Pig////Unfortunately, I didn't think the food here was as great as other reviews proclaim! I was visiting Chicago from California, and I added this place on my restaurant list since there's tons of good praise and some even claim this is the best food they had in Chicago... which I either ordered the wrong things or there's other restaurants to discover. I came here on Saturday (party of 2) at opening, 11:30AM. I was a little afraid of the line since it was long and moving slowly, but I did end up making it during this first seating!
