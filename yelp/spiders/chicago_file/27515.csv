Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm not a vegetarian but I think the Lou's Special is probably the best pizza that I've had in Chicago from any of the big Chicago pizzeria chains. Â The spinach and fresh tomatoes and mushrooms are a really great flavor combination. Lou's has pretty good service and you can call in the pizza will be ready when you get there if you just want to grab it and take it home.
