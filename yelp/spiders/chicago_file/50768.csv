Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place deserves a 5 star review. Since moving to Chicago, this is our go to place for dinner. It is amazing small plates to share with two or more. I highly recommend the braised short ribs. It comes with manchego mashed potatoes, which in my opinion, should be there own dish to order.
