Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////When I woke up this morning, and this has happened more than once, I had a hankering for Wildberry Cafe. I wish I lived closer to Chicago, but if I ate there every day, I'd have to admit to myself that I have less will power than I thought. In my recent visit to Chicago, I frequented this restaurant twice. Considering there were several places I wanted to try and I went back, showed me that I had it bad.
