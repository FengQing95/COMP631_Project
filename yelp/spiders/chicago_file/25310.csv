Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The best deep pizza ever!! You have to try The Lou, so tasty and so fresh, it is just delicious. Also, the Calamari Fritti is really good as an appetizers. The service is awesome, even the manager came to check on us. I will come back for sure, now I love Chicago even more.
