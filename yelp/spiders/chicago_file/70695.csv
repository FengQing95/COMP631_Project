Little Goat Diner////This dinner was such a letdown. The salad was four pieces of lettuce with a sprinkling of dressing and poorly flavored croutons. My veggie quesadilla was pretty much a crunchy tortilla stuffed with just eggplant. I was expecting a much tastier dinner given all the hype around this place.
