Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I'm a big fan of breakfast and this is the place for me. While we travel we try to eat local and in Chicago that's a lot easier to do so via yelp I found this place and it was well worth the walk. I had the strawberry glazed waffle and side of bacon. Staff was top notch food was very good I will be back again.
