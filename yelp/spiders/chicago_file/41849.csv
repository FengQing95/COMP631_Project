Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////If your in the mood for a fun, loud place I would recommend Ba-Ba-Reeba.  This place is always crowded.   The sangria is good but didn't blow me away.  Good selection of food.  Will be a pricey bill if you are hungry -- like most Tapas places.  I am big on atmosphere and prefer a bit more privacy when dining (just my preference).
