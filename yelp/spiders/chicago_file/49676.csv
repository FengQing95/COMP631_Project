Smoque BBQ////Yummo is what I said in my quick tip and yummo is what I ended up getting. This place is always busy and I think it is the best BBQ in Chicago and up there with any Texas BBQ place. You get in line, order at the counter and then they call your number when your food is ready all the while trying to make sure you get seated as well. The people are friendly and the food is great. On this particular occasion I had the Baby Back ribs and they were outstanding. All of the sides are great as is the brisket. So if you are in the neighborhood give it a try!
