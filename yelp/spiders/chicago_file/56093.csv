Smoque BBQ////Best BBQ I have had so far in Chicago. Super smokey and meat focused; the sauce leans towards the vinegary end of the spectrum which is always a plus in my book! The sides can be hit or miss, but once that smoked pork and brisket is in front of me I have never felt a strong need for anything else.
