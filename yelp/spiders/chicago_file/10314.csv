Art Institute of Chicago////One of my favorite art museums in all of the world- and I have been to some of the top art museums. Truly such a wonderful collection of exhibits and pieces. Beautifully curated in a gorgeously designed building. If you are visiting Chicago, this is a MUST SEE. You don't want to miss it.
