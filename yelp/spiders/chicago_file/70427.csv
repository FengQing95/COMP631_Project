Little Goat Diner////The food was seriously seriously delicious. I was almost reminded of the chive pancakes I ate when I was a kid in Korea. It was pretty healthy (I guess?) too with the vegetables on top. Together with the pork belly and the pony pilsner, I had a wonderful meal especially with Jennifer serving me.
