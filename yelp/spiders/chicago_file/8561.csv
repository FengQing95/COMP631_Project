Art Institute of Chicago////I did not realize that the picture Cameron stares at for so long in Ferris Bueller's Day Off was so big, or so beautiful in person.  There was a great photography exhibit that I fell in love with (I have a passion for really good photography), as well as the Ancient Egypt exhibit.
