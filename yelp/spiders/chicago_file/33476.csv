Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Could this place get any swankier? I loved everything (except for one minor note below) about this dinner! The vibe is old school and so classy, yet manages to be the most romantic steakhouse I have ever seen. The menu gives you the choice to do the full expensive steak dinner thing, or you can get some fried chicken, stroganoff or other simpler dishes for a more casual dinner. We opted for the full-on steakhouse experience, which will cost you. We shared a big-ass aged steak a bunch of the sides and a few appetizers. We also had a couple cocktails to start and while I can't remember the exact names they were boozy perfection! My one beef (ha, get it!) was that our server encouraged us to get our steak well done. I never ever do that and thought it was odd, but he assured us that the crunch outside was going to be worth it since this was a huge bone-in steak. The flavors were there but I rally missed that inside pink steak experience and not sure why if I ordered the steak medium I wouldn't have still gotten the same thing. But, he was right on so many other suggestions that he gets a pass. Also, I love the rule that folks can BYO but have to share a glass with another table of the server's choosing! We got picked to try a Bordeaux that was OK, but I am pretty glad I didn't spend my own money on. We preferred our cheaper Cotes Du Rhone! I can't wait to come back and will likely go the cheaper fried chicken route this time around!
