Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Went to Lou's on a Tuesday night. It was pretty empty. Sat at the bar and ordered beers that weren't very cold. We ordered the Lou's signature deep dish (cheese and sausage). It was okay. I liked that despite being a deep dish pizza, it didn't feel very "heavy". But overall, I thought it was kinda bland. We chose Lou's over other deep dish places based off reviews and suggestions from locals. It was a let down:-(
