Smoque BBQ////My only compliant, is its Sunday at 11 - they just open, only one other table occupied. We come in, ask do we sit ourselves, "order and sit, how many in your party"... I tell him were waiting on our friend, which then he says "cant sit until your entire party is here"... R U SERIOUS. So we all order and sit, still the place is not full, they rush us out - lingering around our table in groups of two removing everything after the guys finish... the sause, the drink, the wrapper from the fries. Total turn off.
