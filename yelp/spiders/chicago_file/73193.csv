Little Goat Diner////And lastly, what I consider the best part of the meal, and perhaps one of the best things I ate on my trip to Chicago was the Crumpets with Chorizo Maple Syrup. The maple syrup was infused with the spice and the salt of the chorizo, which elevated something as amazing as maple syrup into something even grander. Having that poured on top of nice fluffy crumpets, and some gooseberries on the side for tartness to balance the sweet maple syrup was out of this world good. It really was the perfect dish. Highly recommended!
