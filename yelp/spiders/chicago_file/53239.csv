Smoque BBQ////I ordered the pulled pork ala carte with a side of the cornbread. I have to say that the pork without any additional sauce would have been just fine but once you add in the sauce, WOW! It was delicious! The pork was moist and the sauce was so flavorful. I also very much enjoyed the cornbread and actually saw some kernels of corn inside which made me appreciate the flavor even more.
