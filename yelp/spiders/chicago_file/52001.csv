Smoque BBQ////i feel slightly guilty only giving three stars because the food was melt-in-your mouth delicious. here are the reasons i cannot give more stars: 1. the secret is out, waiting in a line out the door on a cold day in chicago is not fun (even if the food is worth it). 2. they did not have any pulled chicken (i felt discriminated for not being a true meat lover) 3. parking was up the street and around the corner (which means i had to drive to get there). 4. the food was extremely rich (almost too much to take)
