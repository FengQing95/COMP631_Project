Smoque BBQ////Between us, we got the full slab of baby back ribs platter (slaw with brisket chili, fries), sliced brisket platter (slaw with cornbread, baked beans), tasting of sausage, and the bread pudding. Some of the reviews say the sides are not good here. I disagree. The baked beans were I think the best I've had. They were very smoky which I enjoyed. Fries were perfect. The brisket chili was tasty. Their slaw was also top notch! Instead of the usual creamy slaws, this was bright and refreshing and made for perfect breaks between all the other heavier fare. The only thing that was a bit subpar was the cornbread. The sausage was perfect. The ribs were yummy, somewhat falling off the bone, but not too much. The brisket was also very solid and paired perfectly with the Carolina vinegar sauce. My boo loved their Memphis - all around sauce. I'm not a sweet tooth, but that bread pudding was amazing.
