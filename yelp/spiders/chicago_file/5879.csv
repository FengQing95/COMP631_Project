The Purple Pig////Phenomenal tapas and extensive drink menu. They have experienced staffs climbing up the ladder to get your wine because there are Â SO MANY WINES. The new location follows a lot of the old layout with an open kitchen. I didn't see any outdoor seating which is a bummer as they're now located in a commercial or residential building.
