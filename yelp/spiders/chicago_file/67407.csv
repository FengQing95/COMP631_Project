Little Goat Diner////The wait was an 45 minutes with 1 couple in front of us on a Wednesday at 9pm. I really didn't get that one and got kinda irritated cause it wasn't slammed like it always is. Maybe a server was out and those empty booths were that guys tables. So off to a bad start, we ordered about 7 dishes (which included a 2 appetizers, 4 main dishes, and a slice of pie) between the three of us, to get that weird wait behind us and on to the food!
