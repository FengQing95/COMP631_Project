Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is a nice place for a group of friends.  Order a bunch of tapas and everyone gets a nibble of everything. Warning: DO NOT GET FILLED EATING THE BREAD BEFORE THE FOOD ARRIVES (I learned this one the hard way haha).  One of my favorite items was the Gazpacho soup - a cold tomato-based soup.  The gazpacho was out of this world!  As for the rest of the food,  it was good, but not super memorable.
