Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I was here a few months after it opened on a date. We could barely get reservations, and when we did we were sent downstairs. It had a different ambiance than the 20's themed music and lounge on the main floor, but it still fit the restaurant. Our server was great and gave many recommendations on what to try. The food was good, albeit pricey. I would definitely recommend this place for that intimate date you were planning for.
