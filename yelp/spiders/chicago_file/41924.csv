Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food was great - some of our favorites were the stuffed mushrooms and the patatas bravas (spicy potatoes) but we also loved the pintxos, specifically the wrapped date and the goat cheese croqueta. I didn't have it, but my girlfriends loved their mango sangria. I liked that it was true to the Spanish style in the sense that the food came out when it was ready, not all at once.
