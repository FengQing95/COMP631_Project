Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love this restaurant. Tonight they fu@@ed up. I go on my birthday at 7pmish there is a 45 minute wait.  On a Tuesday yes yes it is. So we wait just the 2 of us. We go sit at a table order drinks and a few tapas bread oil repeat. We're talking time is passing. I say we might as well stay here but the stools are high and I don't like to dine in high barstools.  They had taken our phone # and didn't call. We went after them 1 hour later and said we r waiting 4 a table. They said oh ... oh yeah... then they magically found a table. One I told the woman to begin with I didn't want to sit at. Sooo... they found another small ass table in the section I originally wanted to sit at. So we sit there and wait. We watch them move tables and chairs to get the setting just right for an expected other party. However in this time they never sent a waiter to us!!!  We had to ask for one. Explaining to them how they treated us they promised to give us a round of drinks   At this point I was sick of being there and just mostly eating oil and bread. So we left. I wasted my bday on them.
