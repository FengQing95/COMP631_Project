Little Goat Diner////As far as things I'm not a huge fan of....I REALLY do not like this little piggy went to china. Something about the chili garlic chive sauce had this bitter/heated after taste that I really couldn't handle. First bite was yum, but by bite number 3, my taste buds were screaming "no more!" I also think the spiciness of the sauce gave me an upset stomach, and I actually have a pretty high tolerance for spicy food.
