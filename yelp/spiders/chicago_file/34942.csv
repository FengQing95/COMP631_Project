Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////One of my all time favorite places now! Came here after a night out for a little late night snack and even at 11:30pm it was busy, fresh, great service and did not disappoint! Ordered a couple of craft cocktails that were amazing... The fried chicken and corn. The fried chicken came out with several pieces.. Plenty to share amongst the table, a side of ranch (they had me at ranch btw), hot sauce and a fancy bucket for the bones. The corn was a concoction I would not have imagined but it was borderline amazing! The service was above par and the ambience was cozy & fun! Can't wait to go back.
