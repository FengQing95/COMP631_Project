Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've been to Bavette's twice now, and from what I recall, it's really good. The second time we went, we got so drunk that I would be lying if I said I remembered anything, but I woke up the next morning with a swollen face/fingers and a vile hangover - only attributable to an evening of rich, salty deliciousness and copious amounts of red wine.... both of which, Bavette's does well.
