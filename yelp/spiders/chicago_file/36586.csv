Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Excellent steakhouse. Really cool speakeasy vibe if you're looking for an alternative to the traditional steakhouse atmosphere. We had amazing drinks- the bartenders here are legit. So much so that we went back up to the bar after our meal. Great service and menu selection. We had filets, the mashed potatoes (standout) an awesome appetizer and everything was cooked perfectly.
