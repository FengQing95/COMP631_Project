Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I ordered the $26 flat iron steak frites, excepting slightly less quality due to its affordability. However I could not have been more incorrect. One of the best steaks I've ever had: so flavorful and tender, it tasted more like filet mignon compared to other flat irons I'd eaten. The frites were delicious, the service was lovely and the atmosphere is dark and comfortable. I absolutely recommend eating here.
