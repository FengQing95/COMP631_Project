Little Goat Diner////Soon after my Sloppy Goat sandwich arrived and I devoured it. It was big, sloppy, flavourful, and the roll was nice and squishy. I would agree with other reviewers that it is on the salty side. If you don't like salty food you won't love it... If you love sloppy joes you will love it... I loved it.
