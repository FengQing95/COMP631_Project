Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Love everything about this place from the good to the atmosphere and service. Every time we go, we are greeted by friendly host staff, waited on by professional servers who are always helpful and knowledgeable about pairings, and then there's the food. Absolutely love everything we've tried from the filet mignon to the elotes to even the burger, stroganoff pasta, and sea salted caramel gelato. Can't wait to dine with them again soon!
