Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ordered 20 different dishes as we had a big group. There was only one dish which I really liked. I don't remember the name but it was a very tender beef dish. You could cut it with a spoon. Since we were celebrating bday's we brought in a cake. It was nice that they didn't charge us BYOC(ake) fee :) I say this b/c Marche charged us a fee for bringing in a cake. The overall bill for 10 people (20 dishes, 2 pitchers of sangria) came to $240.00. Not bad for 10 people but I have to say that I'll stick with Cafe Iberico and Twist a Tapas next time I'm in the mood for tapas.
