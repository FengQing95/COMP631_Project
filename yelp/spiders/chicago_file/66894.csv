Little Goat Diner////One of my favorite breakfast spots when in the West Loop. Whether sit down breakfast/brunch or just swinging by for a fresh baked bagel (Grumpy Goat is the best!!) and coffee, this place never disappoints. Their loaves of bread and cream cheeses are awesome to take home for company. Love love Little Goat!! Only downside is the parking in that area.
