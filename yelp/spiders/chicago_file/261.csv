Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This place gets four stars both for their service and food.  We came here on a Sunday and had only a ten minute wait which surprised me being how many people were waiting outside for a seat.  We ordered an omelet with sun dried tomatoes, goat cheese, basil, and avocado.  For a side we had the berry bliss pancakes.  My husband and I decided to split the meal which the server took in stride.  The problem came when the food arrived.  They confused our food with the table next to ours which was almost the same order.  I was halfway through the omelet when my husband finished the pancakes, started on the omelet, and noticed the problem.  The server immediately figured out what occurred and gave us what we ordered, despite that I had eaten so much of the incorrect order.  The server was apologetic and quick to resolve the issue.  Overall the omelet was only ok but the pancakes were wonderful.
