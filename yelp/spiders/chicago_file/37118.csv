Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////What really set Bavette's apart was the experience of my wife having to send back her filet for being overcooked.  Both the server and the manager apologized and handled the situation flawlessly. My wife had a new steak, cooked perfectly, and less than 10 minutes.  They offered a complimentary dessert for the steak issue, but we declined due to having no room for it even though the list was tempting.
