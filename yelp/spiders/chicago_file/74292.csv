Little Goat Diner////Thank God for my real estate agent for bringing me and my partner here for brunch one Sunday. Because this place is always busy, we sat at the bar (which is full service) and ordered the fish tacos and okonomiyaki. Although I didn't love the tacos (too fried, kind of cold), my partner DEVOURED his pork belly pancake and vowed to return soon. The best part of the meal, however, was the bartender. He was incredibly friendly, patient, and knowledgable. Great staff and great vibe!
