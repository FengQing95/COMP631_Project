Smoque BBQ////The service was fast, and most of the food was warm by the time we got home. (The fry bag was open so our taters got a bit chilled). That being said, the fries were still awesome, the brisket I am told was tender and delicious. The mac was good and the beans were delicious... though strict veggies beware a meat chunk did live in the beans. I also indulged in some corn bread which had corn in it and was not your typical dry cornbread. And I'm not big on slaw, but the fiance really dug that it wasn't made with mayo.
