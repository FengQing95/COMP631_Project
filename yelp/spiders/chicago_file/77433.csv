Little Goat Diner////Oh my little goat! Okay before I delve into the delicious food and atmosphere I have to give some major love to Jessica! They say first impressions are lasting and while I believe in second impressions Jessica did not need a do over. I had a reservation which I strongly urge anyone to make especially during brunch. I was greeted by Jessica who asked if I wanted to sit inside or the outside patio. Mother Nature was at her finest and it was a perfect summer day so I couldn't resist the urge to sit outdoors. Jessica mentioned that it might be a bit of a wait because it's summer and of course everyone wants to secure one of those coveted seats.
