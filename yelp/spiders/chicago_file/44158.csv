Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The place was very busy, so a reservation is recommended. The only negative aspect was that our server was a bit on the brisk side (he was very busy though), and it was a little too cold for me in the back room. The price was very reasonable and the tapas came out with good timing. Overall a very good dining experience, especially for a family.
