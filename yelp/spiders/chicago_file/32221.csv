Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have UC, so I'm (sadly) gluten-free, but there's no way I was visiting Chicago without ordering a GF deep dish pizza. I loved that the pizza took its sweet time because it was made fresh, from scratch. I rarely care for any GF pizza dough (just being honest), BUT my pie was still enjoyable because of the delightfully unique and fresh tomato sauce, combined with cheesy goodness.
