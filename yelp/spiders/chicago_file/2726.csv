The Purple Pig////We got the broccoli and roasted garlic with anchovy sauce -- very tasty. Also tried the Pork Neck Bone Gravy, not my favorite dish. It's a pork marinara concoction that is, well, it's not what I think of when I think of marinara. There's a bunch of other dishes that I wish we had time to try, but we'll be back!
