Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The ambiance was fine; not too loud, not too quiet. The hostesses were polite and friendly, the restaurant was clean. Our server kept perfect tabs on us (I was remiss in not getting her name), and kept our glasses filled and made sure we wanted for nothing. Even the back waiters were attentive, clearing dishes as soon as we were finished and keeping our waters filled.
