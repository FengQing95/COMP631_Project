Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pretty Damn good I have to say although the best Chicago Style pizza ever is in Sacramento California at a little dive on 21st street called Zelda's.  Back to Chicago,   I'd say it's right about the same as Gino's.  I' likely just pissed off a bunch of Gino's fans.  Sorry!    I really wish the pepperoni at LM's  was cut a little smaller and was more flavorful and that they used more sauce on the pizza, sauce to cheese ratio was a tad off but great buttery crust, choose that option.  Salads are great, service is very good.  Draft beer was not very cold, had to ask for a colder glass, who wants warm beer?   Giardano's is on my list to try next then I'll review them and update here.
