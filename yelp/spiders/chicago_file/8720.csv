Art Institute of Chicago////The museum is HUGE and I would recommend mapping out your must-sees before you go, that way you can see them first and then wander and enjoy.  It is a great deal of walking so go for comfortable shoes.  You can also work up an appetite exploring- I had lunch at the Museum Café and it was very good, a tad pricey but worth the convenience.
