Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////At the end of the meal... we open up the bill, and it was FREE.  The whole meal, including the sangria!  Because the food was so good, and the fact that the manager/hostess knew enough that we had gotten screwed on our table, and they fixed it without a single complaint, I am DEFINITELY going back (I think I'll make a reservation this time though...)
