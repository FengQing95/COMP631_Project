Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is a gem. Few downtown Chicago restaurants manage to combine one of the best steaks in the city with a lounge worth visiting on a night out. The upstairs, main dining room is large with a old library feeling, big, comfy leather tufted booths with dim lighting line a sprawling bar- big enough to actually be able to enjoy your dinner at (rather than eating on top of the diner next to you).
