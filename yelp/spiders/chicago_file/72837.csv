Little Goat Diner////The highlight for sure, though, was the bull's eye french toast.   This masterpiece was made with two thick slices of sweet onion brioche.  Each contained an egg - toad in the hole style.  The eggs were just under hard cooked, which may or may not have been intended, but I loved it.  The whole thing was then topped with fresh strawberries, bits of crispy fried, chicken, and the perfect amount of bbq maple syrup.   I'm a syrup dipper and don't like soggy or overly sweet french toast -- this was neither.
