Little Goat Diner////The Hubs and I shared 2 sammies, the Los Drowned (braised beef with havarti cheese, grilled onions, avocado and probably something else...it was EXCELLENT!), and their special Grilled Cheese (also DEE-LISH, tasted like an amazing grilled cheese & tomato soup all in one).  We shared an order of their fries which are smoked fries...they were tasty but to me they tasted exactly like those TGIFridays Potato Skins Potato Chips.  Still good but for the amount you get I don't think they were worth $6.  Now, did we NEED more fries? No..we were plenty full so at least they saved us from ourselves. ;)
