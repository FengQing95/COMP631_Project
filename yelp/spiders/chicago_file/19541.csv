Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We came hear after hearing all of the recommendations from locals & our friends! We were very excited to try the deep dish pizza. There was not a wait when we arrived. We were seated immediately. My husband, nephew, & I ordered a salad, wings, & 2 pizzas. The food took pretty long to come out. We definitely over estimated our appetites and didn't finish the food, but were so excited to try everything! Unfortunately, the pizza was heavy and a little on the soggier side. The cheese didn't seem fully melted & there was not much flavor. We may give this place another try when we come!
