Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The stroganoff that I had two years ago lacked meat and flavor. The wedge I had tonight bears pretty much the same description. The shrimp appetizer which costs a whopping $18.00 was nothing to write home about either. The Texas Toast it came with needed butter to make it palatable (otherwise it was just burnt bread with parsley on top). The only decent item was the butternut squash, but not worth the price and not anything you can't make at home or enjoy elsewhere.
