Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Prices are expensive for what you get and yes, I understand that its tapas, but personally its not my thing. Scallops were great.... but 3 for 8.99 come on... Octopus was good and probably the largest portion, #67 if i could remember was the Shrimp... Amazing. The only dislike in the food was the cheese platter and I absolutely love cheese.  Let be serious, I walked out ("dinner" / tapas for two) with a bill of $90. and some odd change, still hungry.  As I said, personally not my cup of tea.
