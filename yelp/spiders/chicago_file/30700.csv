Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The menu has a ton of pizza options, but because it was our first visit I knew that we'd have to go with the Lou Malnati classic. Sausage pizza with a butter crust... I mean, c'mon. We also ordered a house salad to go along with the pizza. The salad was the perfect precursor to the heavy pizza - light and refreshing with a ton of delicious toppings. But of course, the real star of the show was the pizza. A small pie is the perfect share for two and comes with four hearty slices. The pizza is incredible - the sauce is fresh and taste homemade, the mozzarella cheese is ooey and gooey, the crust is buttery and flakey. I'm still dreaming about this pizza.
