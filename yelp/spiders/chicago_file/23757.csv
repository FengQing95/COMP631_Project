Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This pie was.sad. Ordered carryout and couldn't wait to dig in at home. Opened the box and it was pathetic. For $25 you would expect a gooey chewy plethora of goodness. Wrong ! They skimped so bad on the ingredients, there was a good half inch from the crust to the fixins. The cheese was so miniscule...I couldn't tell where the cheese and bread met. And mind you....I ordered the Lou special which was supposed to have extra cheese. I dont know whether it is a profit margin thing due to this being a newish location in pricey downtown Oak Park or just not caring. But, there are better venues within striking distance and I definitely will rethink my association with Mr. Malnati's establishment.
