The Purple Pig////It was difficult to get reservations here during lunch and dinner times on the weekend. Ordered the Â lMilk Braised Berkshire Shoulder which was delicious - soft and full of flavours. The BBQ Pork Ribs was good but it was on the sweeter side and the Crispy Pig's Ears were my least favourite because it was salty and honestly it tasted like fried batter. The restaurant was pretty loud and it was difficult to chat.
