Little Goat Diner////Bullseye French Toast - 9/10 - Little Goat Diner's own twist on the chicken and waffle dish. Instead, waffles are replaced with french toast and the BBQ maple syrup sauce is to die for. The chicken is crispy and this dish is a perfect venture into fusion territory with a twist on a classic dish.
