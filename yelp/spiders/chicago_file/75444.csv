Little Goat Diner////Expensive but the absolutely most enjoyable brunch in the city of Chicago. The biscuits and gravy are one of my favorite things. The breakfast cocktails are also fantastic. Last time I went here it was 70.00 for brunch for my wife and I which is steep. It's a little cheaper if you go here alone. Great place.
