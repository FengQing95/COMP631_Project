Little Goat Diner////I had a great brunch here!  My hubby and I spent the Tuesday before Thanksgiving downtown and went to Little Goat for brunch the next morning.  I was surprised by how busy it was (although we didn't have to wait), and I can imagine it gets crazy on weekends.  The decor was diner trendy and the service was friendly.  But the real star here was my meal--I got the Parathas Burrito and it was deeeeelicious!  It sounded really unusual, but the waitress recommended it and I'm so glad she did.  It was very flavorful (a little spicy) and very fresh.  My husband ordered the breakfast spaghetti and he liked it a lot (although it wasn't my favorite).  I will definitely be back the next time I come to Chicago.
