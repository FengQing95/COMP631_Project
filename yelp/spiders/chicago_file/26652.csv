Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////You hear about how Chicago is the home of Deep Dish Pizza.  Chicago has a variety of places to choose from starting with the original Pizzeria Uno, to Gino's East, Giordano's, Chicago's and a whole bunch of others.  When it comes down to the best deep dish, I have to say hands down my favorite is Lou Malnati's!
