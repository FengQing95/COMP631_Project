Little Goat Diner////I had the Kimchee & bacon & eggs & pancakes asian style breakfast tasty thing.  I loved it.  It was a nice portion size.  Maybe I'm in the minority, but I really liked that the kimchee was on the milder side. It gave the perfect zingy taste to the tasty pancakes and the salty smoky bacon. It was a great balance.
