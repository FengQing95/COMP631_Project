Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I worked here, like, 10 years ago so it could be said that I'm a little biased, but Ba Ba Reeba has ALWAYS been my favorite tapas place in the city. Â I've tried 'em all at some point or another and always felt like coming back here was coming home to what the tapas experience should be.
