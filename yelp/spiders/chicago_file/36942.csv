Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Filet Mignon:  Cooked med rare plus. It was perfectly cooked and evenly purplish/pink. The meat was very tender and flavorful. The only gripe I had about the filet mignon was that the outside was over salted. I had to cut out the edges to avoid feeling like I was eating a salt-lick. Aside from that, AMAZING steak.  4/5
