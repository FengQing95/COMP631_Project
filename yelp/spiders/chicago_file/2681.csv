The Purple Pig////Pros: Food was outstanding, definitely 5 stars for their fantastic flavors, the reason I gave it 3 stars is outlined under cons, below. I had the butternut squash soup and the corn bread. Both were a thing of dreams, the soup was velvety, the cornbread sweet and salty with nice chunks of cheese, honestly the food is all it is talked up to be.
