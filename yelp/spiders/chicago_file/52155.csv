Smoque BBQ////BEST. BBQ. EVER!!! The chopped beef brisket platter is phenomenal, so soft and moist. The sauce has the perfect amount of zing, if its too much for you ask for their other sauce on the side. The mac and cheese is reaaallyyyy cheesy, basically melts in your mouth as you eat it. I hate coleslaw but their coleslaw is to die for I can eat buckets of it a day! You can't go wrong with smoque if your looking for good BBQ.
