Little Goat Diner////I also got a cinnamon bun and some smoked fries. The bun is certainly better made but, if I'm honest, not actually more satisfying than what you could find at Cinnabon. The smoked fries were an incredibly disappointing small cupful of average fries that barely had any smoke flavor -- hardly worth 3 dollars in my opinion, much less the $6 they actually charged.
