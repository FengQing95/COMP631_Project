Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I used to live in Gurnee and went to their Libertyville location occasionally - not a lot but I would say often - with my mom and sister and we've  always loved it.  So, when we moved to Chicago, we were gonna miss it so we really excited when we heard this location opened.  My sister and I have been here maybe twice and we decided to come again Saturday, April 9th, with my mom as we're moving away to an area with no Wildberry to kind of say goodbye/have a final Wildberry meal because we loved it here. No stranger to Wildberry and how busy they are and their wait times, we left at 9:30 and, when we arrived at 10, we were told it was an hour and forty-five minute wait. No big deal because we expected it and we know Wildberry is worth it.  Good was great, as usual, and our server, Robert, was pretty good, even though it was crazy busy (also as usual).  However, we were less than thrilled at the end of our meal after I had paid and signed the check, which is why this review has three stars instead of five. When the check was dropped off, we were feeling like we were rushed to leave, as the busboy came to clear out plates but he also took the spare silverware and cleared our drinks and we definitely thought "It's like they're trying to rush us out but we waited an hour and a half for this table so we're gonna stay a little bit longer."  Well, after I paid and signed the check (big mistake to do before you're ready to leave, especially since we were seated the check from the previous group was still on the table so they obviously didn't rush them), I went to use the restroom and then, when I returned, my mom and sister went to use the restroom and that was when they really tried to rush us and push us out because the busboy came to clean the table and start setting it up for another group - which I didn't mind because I figured it would make it easier for when we left. What I didn't expect was for them to seat the next party right away when, obviously, my party was not done with the table yet.  My remaining party members were just using the restroom - they were going to be back in five minutes, less than that, actually! We were going to leave when they got back but it was decided for us that we were done with the table, just because I paid and signed the check. I get that it's a peak time and you have other customers waiting but that's no reason to push people out. It's poor customer service to rush people and try to push them the second the check is signed and paid for.  This has never happened to me at a Wildberry before and it was appalling. Even when they're busy, the Libertyville location never rushed us.  And, when I come to visit friends who still live in/close to this area, I was going to make it a point to come back just because I love Wildberry, but, now, I think I'm gonna stick to any location but this one.
