Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////- Pizza: more pure separated ingredients than a bunch of stuff mooshed together. Good in that it didn't give the processed feeling to it, but ding in that it was a bit lacking in flavor. I noticed 2 other big differences from other deep dishes I've had: crust was like a thin pie crust than thick doughy and it wasn't topped with a layer of crushed tomatoes.
