Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////At this point, we should have probably stopped eating, but we don't have self discipline when it comes to food, so we ate on with the paella. It could probably feed an army. They don't joke around with their paella. It is a must cause at this point I was having trouble breathing from all the food consumption that was done previously to this dish. But, for me to still think this plate is delicious must say something good about it cause when you're about to vomit no food taste good...except this paella. That sausage was so amazing and the beef was so tender. Legit!
