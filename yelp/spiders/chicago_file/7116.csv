Art Institute of Chicago////i headed straight for the modern, contemporary, european, and early american wings. i was visually overwhelmed...and had flashbacks to the museums in new york. it wasnt as busy as i expected, so that was a big plus. one thing that did disappoint me was the $6 fee for the auditory tour...it was free at the Frick in NY. i wasnt able to take pictures due to the misinformed guides within the galleries. someone else told me i could toward the end of my venture. by then, it was closing time and i was already too pooped to retrace my steps.
