Art Institute of Chicago////If you ever travel to Chicago this is a Must Visit! I am very fond of the arts.. The museums staff is very professional and on their A Game! Very knowledgable and informative and still friendly and also firm. The exhibits are beautifully placed and sensor protected... Well done Chicago!
