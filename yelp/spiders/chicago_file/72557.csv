Little Goat Diner////Yes, I am joining the band of 5-star-reviewers for this one. We came when only the "bread" part was open at 'lil G... and despite this, everything was oh-so MAGICAL! If this was an indication of how the diner's going to be... without a doubt, I shall return to experience the epicness. We stopped in for a quick bite and ordered two sandwiches: turkey and shrimp. My lunch companion said that it was hands down, BEST SANDWICH he's ever had. I highly recommend the shrimp: the crunchy masa chip combined with hearty pieces of shrimp and avocado = lunch heaven. The turkey came in close second with the honey almonds. We also got the goat chili which came with a bunch o' fixins and a slice of bread. A wintry staple is now 'lil G's goat chili: gamey, luscious, stick-to-your-ribs deliciousness.
