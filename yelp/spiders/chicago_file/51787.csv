Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I am also not generally into enormous restaurants. I didn't choose this place, but the interior is so large, so many rooms, huge staff, no intimacy. And sure enough, a high school group walked out as we were coming in. I think as a general rule, I am never going to like a restaurant that caters to a high school sports team. That to me, indicates a blandness and lack of creativity that would appeal to a wide range of people. I want food to challenge me, as well as satiate. Also, having an out of use enormous bar in the back room looked tacky. It felt like we were shuffled into the utility closet. The bar should either be fully set up or maybe have a curtain over it to hide the empty counter top.
