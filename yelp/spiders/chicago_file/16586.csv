Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We didn't have to wait at all! I was surprised by this, as the place was pretty full. Best pizza I've ever had! We ordered the classic, or original, or whatever but we were so hungry and excited that we just went with it and were very impressed. Great tomatoes! The only negative was that my fork was dirty and I had to ask a couple of times for a new one. I will definitely go back next time I'm in Chicago.
