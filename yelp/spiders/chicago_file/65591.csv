Smoque BBQ////We visited my new favorite BBQ place last night.  We tried an amazing array of their BBQ and it is by far some of if not THE BEST BBQ I have ever had.  My favorite is the St. Louis style ribs, the flavor combo of the dry rub and the smoked cooking made me not want to even use any sauce for fear I would cover up the amazing flavor profile from the ribs.  The baby backs are great too and just as good.  The brisket was incredibly smokey delicious and is the MOST TENDER and moist brisket I have ever tasted and as brisket is a favorite of my husband's I have tried a lot.  The pulled pork was flavor packed and tasty as well but the sleeper of the menu was the chicken, it was so thoroughly dry rubbed and smoked that the smokey flavor permeated and tenderized every cell, it was moist and flavor PACKED.  That doesn't even mention the sides like the absolutely AMAZING mac n cheese which is one of my faves so I know my mac n cheese.  The coleslaw which is something I normally would not touch, I tried at the behest of Barry the owner and I was amazed at the fresh palate clearing flavor and texture of it, it reminds me of a German cucumber salad.  I'm told the baked beans are amazing,  I didn't try them but as beans don't agree with my system I decided to take their word on that.  The cornbread is buttery and salty deliciousness with great texture.   And then there was dessert (not that we needed it but hey if you are going to taste it all why not?)  The peach cobbler with the oatmeal crumble topping was tasty without being overly sweet like many peach cobblers.  The surprise to me was the bread pudding which has always creaped me out because it always just looked like soggy bread in other places but there's was so tasty and reminiscent of a baked French toast with the butter, cinnamon and pecans (which I could do without but I'm weird I know) made it fantastic and the nuts gave it a crunch that did indeed complete it.  We were also introduced to Cowboy Candy or candied jalapenos which were pretty excellent too.  Thank you so much to Barry the owner who made our visit one of the most amazing experiences of my life.  I recommend this restaurant whole heartedly.  UNBEATABLE BBQ!  PERIOD!
