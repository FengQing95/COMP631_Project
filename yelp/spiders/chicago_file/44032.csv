Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ba-Ba-Reeba is an excellent Tapas restaurant. Our favorite dishes: spicy potatoes, shrimp in garlic oil, short rib and beef medallions. Everything is very delicious and the sangria is the bomb! They always have a seasonal option too which is nice for variety. There is usually a wait so reservations are recommended. Parking gets tricky on halsted sometimes but they do have valet.
