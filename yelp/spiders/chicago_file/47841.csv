Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Comfortable, low key atmosphere; good prices. More importantly, great food, atmosphere and service. Tonight we had Corinna who gave thoughtful recommendations, took care of under seasoned + overcooked calamari, and kept a genuine smile throughout the evening. Great experience - thank you :)
