Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We had a bottle of red, which went well with the steak, but felt a bit overpriced for what it was. I later learned they allow you to bring your own wine, so that might be a better idea for next time! On the other hand, the cocktails we had were absolutely delicious. Try the mint julep if you're into that kind of thing. You won't be disappointed.
