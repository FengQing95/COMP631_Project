Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////There is something about Cafe Ba - Ba - Reeba that makes me want to go there again and again. The ambience is so cozy and comfortable. I am fond of the tapas style menu. The food in general is very good. I tried their popular Paella but didn't quite like it. The rice was undercooked and there was nothing special about it. My favorites are the chicken empanada, stuffed mushrooms, and lamb. The desserts here are amazing. The portions are just the right amount and I love the chocolate truffle cake. I think it's the truffle cake that makes me wanna keep going back :) This restaurant is great for groups and date nights.
