Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////First time dinning here, but will definitely not be my last! Amazing meal! Very prompt service with the waiter making some great recommendations on different wines. There was 2 of us and we shared 4 different tapas and a few dessert tapas. I went home with leftovers! Easy to get to from the el, I wouldn't recommend driving as the street parking filled up quickly.
