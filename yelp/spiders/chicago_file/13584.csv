Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////YUM YUM YUM. Having been to UNO's chain in the past (and not being that impressed), I was anxious to try a true Chicago Deep Dish pizza from a Chicago staple. I needed something to change my mind. I had always thought I knew what a true deep dish was, but boy was I wrong! Lou Malnati's encompassed the essence of the Windy City. Not only was their pizza tasty, but the gangster/team posters made it feel like you were in a true Chi-town family restaurant.
