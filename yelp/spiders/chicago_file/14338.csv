Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This review is purely on the service of this restaurant. Upon arriving we were told it would be long wait (which is perfectly fine) however then the hostess proceeded to roll her eyes and talk nasty. The food may have great reviews however this service especially from a waitress which is the first person you see when you walk in is unacceptable. Not only did they lose a group of 15 today, but we also will NEVER come here again. What a rude waitress, so unfortunate she ruined the restaurant for us.
