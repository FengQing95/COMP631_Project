Smoque BBQ////Everybody has already waxed poetic about this joint, so I don't have a whole to do other than to add to the chorus about Smoque having some great brisket, pulled pork and some pretty good baby backs as well. Sides, for the most part, hit the spot too. Sadly, they don't serve any beer to wash down your BBQ, but it is BYOB (inside only).
