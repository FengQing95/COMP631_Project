Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Every Chicagoan has their spot for Deep Dish (which maybe it's just me, but I only eat deep dish at birthday parties and if people come in from out of town). Lou's is my spot and I'll sing it's praises to anyone who dares whisper the name of an inferior competitor when someone asks to try Deep Dish for the first time (or second or 95th time).
