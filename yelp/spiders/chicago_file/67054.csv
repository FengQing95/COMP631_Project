Little Goat Diner////We had a late lunch at Little Goat and we can't say enough good things about it. We made a reservation and got seated right at our time by a very friendly guy. We didn't catch his name, but very friendly! We got to sit at a table for two set up higher so you could see the entire restaurant. Great atmosphere, very alive! We were greeted by our server Anna immediately. By the end of our time there we agreed Anna was probably the best server we've ever had and that's saying a lot!!! So helpful with ideas on the menu to sharing history of the restaurant and all the other restaurants by the same owner. Can't wait to try Duck Duck Goat next time we are in town from Kansas City! The food was unique and AMAZING! I had a special of the day Crab Rangoon Omelet. So tasty! My husband went Â for the French toast and a single Dark Chocolate Pancake. Out of this world amazing on both! We had mentioned to Anna we were in town celebrating our 25th anniversary. After sufficiently stuffing ourselves ....she surprised us with their speciality lemon pie which is what I would've ordered if I had room. She read my mind and said it's on us so even if you have one bite it's ok. One bite definitely wasn't going to cut it. Once again the taste sensation can't be put to words. As we were waiting for Anna to bring back our bill that friendly guy who sat us came back to our table. He had on his backpack to go because it was the end of his shift. He brought us two of Little Goats homemade cookies. I guess just because we were just as nice to him as he was to us when he sat us!!! Go to this place!!!!!!! You will love it!
