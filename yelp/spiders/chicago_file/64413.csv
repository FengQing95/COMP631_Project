Smoque BBQ////Food...they know BBQ. Our party of four had (1) chopped brisket platter (5 stars), (2) sliced brisket platter (5 stars), (3) 1/2 baby back ribs (3 stars), (4) pulled pork (5 stars)...so we tried a lot of stuff and with only one exception it was exceptional BBQ. The brisket really stuck out...tender, moist, flavorful throughout the meat, and whether you get it chopped or sliced it was a very nice hefty serving. The flavor permeates all the way through the meat (hence the Smoque name I guess); the smoke flavor is not just painted on top once the meat is done but slow-cooked all the way through. I'd get brisket again. The only off point was the ribs...they had a wonderful bark on them and the same smokey flavor but the meat was a bit dry and tough. They were baby-back though so maybe that was to be expected...but my vote goes for the brisket anyway. The platters come with slaw and two sides...we tried cornbread (straight up with no herbs and 4 stars), fries (with the skin on and 4 stars), coleslaw (vinegary and 4 stars), mac and cheese (creamy and just like Kraft does it and 5 stars), and BBQ beans (with small pieces of BBQ meat in it and 5 stars), and one of us tried the pecan bread pudding (perfect foil for the BBQ flavors and 5 stars). The meals come with two 5 star BBQ sauces...Memphis (has a tang to it) and Carolina (thinner and vinegary).
