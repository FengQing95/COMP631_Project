Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Loved the sausage deep dish pizza!!  The line was long, the staff was friendly.  Service was great!  Food came out when promised and steaming hot!  If you go there knowing there will be a wait to sit and a wait for the food, you are set up to succeed!!  That's the downside of going to a very popular, amazing spot!
