Smoque BBQ////Service was exceptional. Especially as newbies, we felt very comfortable. Even during our short wait in line, we were assured that a table would be waiting for us after placing our order. During our meal, we were asked if we needed anything. Staff ended up getting a to-go box for us, even though we were right next to them. They even suggested and gave us a separate bag for the sauces and sides in case of spillage. Also, we did not have to wait long at all for our food to be ready.
