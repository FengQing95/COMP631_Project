Little Goat Diner////I hate to give Little Goat such a low review but honesty is the best policy. I went on a Thursday evening so I did not have to wait for a table. I was seated at a booth near the west wall of windows. The booths are on a platform so you need to be careful stepping on and off.  I had done a bit of research on Little Goat's menu since I have dietary restrictions. I can't eat fried and fatty foods, dairy, or pork. You must be asking why would I go to Little Goat then.  I know Little Goat is all about comfort food with a twist but it's menu did include salads. One of my issues with Little Goat is that it does not offer many low fat, healthier options. I wish I could pig out on their menu but I do not want to spend the rest of my evening at the ER. I informed the waiter of my dietary restrictions and he tried to be as helpful as possible. I was very impressed.  After asking the waiter for recommendations, I settled on the Asian shrimp salad and my dad ordered the fried chicken. We also ordered the dinner rolls.  So far so good.
