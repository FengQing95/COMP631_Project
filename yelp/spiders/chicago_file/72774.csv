Little Goat Diner////Oh REALLY?  Fat lie.  They were, and it was a 45 minute wait.  We were pissed, but set on going, so we wandered and found a bar to have a drink or two and pass the time.  We ordered drinks, and then MINUTE WE SAT DOWN we got a text saying the table was ready.  A friend & I went to claim the table while the others finished their drinks, but when we arrived, they wouldn't seat us without our full party.  I get that, I do, but someone needs to be better about time estimation if that's the case.   I was annoyed.
