Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////With that said, if you find yourself wanting deep dish near your hotel, go to Lou Malnati's, it is still my favorite deep dish. Go here especially if you are visiting Chicago and haven't made reservations anywhere else. Two reasons: 1) Deep dish dinner is a must and 2) You are seriously going to wait over an hour (if not much more) at any restaurant if you did not make any other reservation. I plead with the tourists who come here, do not complain about the wait! It is like that everywhere. Plan ahead or plan to wait.
