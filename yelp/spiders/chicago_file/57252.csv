Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////For a group of 20, ordering was not painful and for the most part, the servers knew what side of the table the food was ordered. We got a variety of tapas and the ones that stood out to me were the spicy potatoes, bacon wrapped dates (a must), paella (portion is huge!). Honestly everything we ordered was great and didn't come with a huge price tag since we were in a big group.
