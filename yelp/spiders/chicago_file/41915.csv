Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My date and I arrived 10 minutes early for our 8 pm reservation on a Friday and were seated right away. Cafe BaBaReeba was packed and there was definitely a wait...but with a glass of delicious sangria in your hand, the wait doesn't matter. Our waiter was very attentive with constant refills on our white sangria, we went with the half pitcher. All of our choices were a hit, crispy spicy potatoes, baked goat cheese, chicken and chorizo skewer, and spanish sausages...however the spanish sausage was supposed to be spanish meatballs, so a minor slip on the servers part here, but we enjoyed our substitution. The baked goat cheese was my favorite...perfect consistency and very tasty with garlic toast.
