Smoque BBQ////So how it works (ordering, not barbecuing--it's probably a secret) is you jump in line, wait, order your food, [behind the scenes it's prepared via a kitchen assembly line], await your order number to be yelled, have the host seat you (or grab any seat you can find), and dig in.  The messier the better--I mean it's BBQ after all!  Just make sure you have your metal platter underneath and a roll of endless napkins at arm's length.  More food than necessary and delicious Mac N Cheese and Baked Beans sides.  I was just recently in St. Louis and Smoque's ribs are ultra close to perfection.  St. Louisians would be proud!
