Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Service was good.  The chicken pomegranate dish and the tortilla were pretty tasty, but the other dishes (the lamb kebab stands out in my mind) was far too oily.  The dessert (caramelized banana) was nothing to write home about.  All in all, the food was meh.  Atmosphere was of a similar sentiment.  Both good, not great.
