Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Thank you Cafe Ba-Ba Reeba for helping my friends and I to host a wonderful baby shower brunch! Michelle Gil was an absolute pleasure to work with during the planning process and couldn't have made things easier. Her excellent, timely communication was very much appreciated. Even though we didn't have a huge group, we still received extra special care and attention. Tabitha did an amazing job taking care of our party the day of the shower. I had never been to Ba-Ba Reeba for brunch before and will definitely be back again. All of the brunch tapas options were delicious. If you are looking for a great place to host a party, look no further. Thank you!
