Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food was so good.  I don't think you could go wrong.  We had the fois grois, wedge salad, oysters and two steaks.  My steak was unfortunately medium though I ordered it medium rare plus.  Other than that, everything was  exceptional.  The chocolate cream pie is the best I've ever had.  It's like soft fudge in a delicious crust.  I'd go just for the pie and a glass of wine!
