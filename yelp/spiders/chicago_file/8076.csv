Art Institute of Chicago////After three days of pounding the pavement in Chicago my foot had had enough. I looked like Willis Reed in Game 7 of the NBA Finals limping from one wing to the next. I guess that's the highest compliment I could pay the museum. I really did want to see every inch of it not knowing if I'd ever get a chance to visit it again.
