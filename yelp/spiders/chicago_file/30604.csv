Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered The Lou in the personal size (~$12). It is filled with spinach, mushrooms, and sliced Roma tomatoes topped with 3 cheeses and their infamous butter crust! The personal size is supposed to be enough for one person, but I actually shared it. The deep dish takes around 35-45 minutes to make, and this was when they weren't busy at all.
