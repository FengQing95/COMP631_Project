Smoque BBQ////My pulled pork (enough to serve 2) was mouthwatering. It was perfectly cooked and also came with a side of extra BBQ sauce (included with the order). The baked mac and cheese was crunchy on top and melted inside. The cornbread was the best though, quite possibly the best comfort food, better than your mom could make it, trust me. I got the peach cobbler as one of my sides (yes, amazingly I had room for dessert)....the perfect ending to the perfect meal. No complaints whatsoever.
