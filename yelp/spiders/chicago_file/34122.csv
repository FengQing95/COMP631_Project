Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We tried this restaurant  for my birthday, i was disappointed, i was so hungry coming in straight from work, but the waiter would not let us put an appetizer in without the entire order.  he said it works best for the kitchen, i dont think thats my problem, and i hurried on a dinner decision just to get an appetizer, over all the food was just ok.  the music was loud and  strange, wont go back... better places out there for special occasions.
