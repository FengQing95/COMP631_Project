Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food is delicious. For the most bang for your buck, I'd suggest to order the pinxos combos. Patatas bravas are my absolute favorite! The atmosphere is a bit sexy, so if you're like me and just rolling by after a rough day at work, you may feel underdressed. It's okay, though. All customers are treated equally :) more detailed review on my blog
