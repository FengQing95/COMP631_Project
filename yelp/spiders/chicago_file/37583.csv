Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We were in Chicago for a one night stay for Â business and decided to search for the best steakhouse in town. I can say the other good reviews were spot on. We tried the crab cake, salmon Caesar, creamed spinach and dry aged ribeye. Wow! The ribeye was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The crab cake was big and not much filler. The atmosphere is not stuffy, and just enough attentive without being overly in your face. The restaurant itself dimly lit. This is a great place for small groups, date nights. I would definitely come back.
