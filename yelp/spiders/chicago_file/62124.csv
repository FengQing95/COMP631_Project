Smoque BBQ////I'd suggest going off hours for a less hurried experience. It's a tight fit, but the food is worth it. Yes, there are other barbeque joints out there, but I like the variety myself. I have definitely enjoyed my dining elsewhere, but I am glad that I've eaten at Smoque and do recommend it.
