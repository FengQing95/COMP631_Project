Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My fave Deep Dish in the city.  We usually get delivery from their Bucktown/Wicker Park Take out location.  The Lou is our fave.  So flavorful - the crust is spectacular and they really get the seasoning and flavor right on that pie.  Delivery takes a bit, since the pizza takes a while to cook, but not too terrible compared to what you have to wait when you dine in anyway.  Bette than the competitors on price, and taste in my opinion! Thanks Lou!
