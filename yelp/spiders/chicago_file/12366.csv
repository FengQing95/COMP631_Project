Art Institute of Chicago////We have been members of the Art Institute for many years and have never been disappointed with all their is to see. Membership has allowed us to easily have short visits when under an hour is what we can have. Senju's Waterfall for Chicago is beautiful and we discovered some Japanese remainders from the Japanese Garden on the Wooded Island. Andre Kertesz: Postcards from Paris was delightful. The Barbara Kruger exhibit was a bit much for us, especially the pounding noise.
