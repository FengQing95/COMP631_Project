Art Institute of Chicago////The new modern wing is beautiful with so much light and I really liked the "no gravity" concept, pretty neat idea. We ate at the Garden Cafe on the lower level, it was decent food and price for being in a museum. The seating is by the outdoor courtyard with a really relaxing view.
