Smoque BBQ////Lineup to get in the door built some anticipation, didn't really like the menu structure but the food was really good. As usual with a BBQ place, ordered too much and paid for it the next day. Had the brisket platter with the taste of pulled pork, ribs, and sausage - decided to have the 1/2 and 1/2 sliced & chopped brisket, would def recommend. It ended up being really, really tasty but it was too much food. Great service, the staff was really awesome and super helpful. Above all, would definitely recommend the bread pudding for dessert - so good. Had the menu ordering structure been more friendly, would have given a five star
