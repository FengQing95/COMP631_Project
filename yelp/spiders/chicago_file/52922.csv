Smoque BBQ////Considering Chicago isn't Memphis, Kansas City, or any where in Texas we might not be the greatest judge of talent when it comes to BBQ. However, if we're just talking food and how good it tastes, Smoque is where it's at. I've had both kinds of ribs, brisket, pulled pork, and the sausage. Not one of those meals disappointed. And I've had them all more than a couple of times each. Consistently good and spot on. The only thing I don't like about Smoque is the size of the place and the wait for food, especially in the summer when the line is pretty much out the door. Sides are small too but evry good especially the mac and cheese, but this isnt enough for me to knock it on points. I'd give it a 4.5 if possible, but since I can't a 5 will do.
