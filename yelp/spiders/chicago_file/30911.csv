Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Not nearly worth the hype. The appetizers were all mediocre, the service was ehh, and the pizza was just slapped together with not much effort. I normally don't get sick or feel heavy after eating, but this pizza joint has me feeling sick and sluggish almost immediately after walking out.
