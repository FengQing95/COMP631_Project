Art Institute of Chicago////- I like how a lot of extremely famous paintings are just sitting there with other not-so-famous paintings. It almost makes the place like a huge scavenger hunt as you have to look at all the other paintings before you find the one you're looking for. These newly discovered paintings could then potentially become one of your favorites! Also, it's kind of interesting they don't particularly place these famous paintings on a special wall because there are so many of them all around.
