Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is my favorite pizza place and have been coming here for decades. The sausage is lower fat then other places for "za" so this less oily. The Chicago Classic version is butter crusted thick deep dish with just the right ratio of cheese to sauce to toppings. Even better the next couple of days as left overs. The BBQ chicken salad is very good as well. Â I come here monthly and you should too (unless your cholesterol is high then get some Lipitor-talk to your doc). Seriously though in all my years living downtown including across the street from Giordano's I would walk the six blocks to go here then Giordano's across the street in my opinion.
