Little Goat Diner////So happy I finally made it to Little Goat. The fish tostadas were AMAZING. I also had the "It's A Pie" malt shake which was delicious. All the shakes are $8 which is kinda pricy but I would definitely recommend it. You'll want to make a reservation beside this is a very popular venue and parking in the area is limited.
