Smoque BBQ////The brisket was servied on a soft, dinner-style bun. The meat was flavorful, tender and smokey. It wasn't drenched in BBQ sauce, but we were each provided with extra sauce in a plastic container. The sauce is thin and vinegar-based--southern style. The cole slaw is also vinegar-based and very sweet. The baked beans were very smokey--much too smokey for my taste. The french fries were fresh cut and served in a small paper bag. They were excellent, except this batch was over salted. The pulled pork was flavorful with a nice crust of bark. Our tab was under $23.00.
