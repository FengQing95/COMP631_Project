Smoque BBQ////The ribs are the best I've ever had....no BBQ sauce needed although theirs is delicious. I had Mac and cheese and fries as my sides and was not disappointed in either! My boyfriend got the brisket chili as it was a special that day and it was amazing. The line gets long but they move through it pretty fast. I recommend getting take out if you're in a hurry. I can't wait to go back!
