Smoque BBQ////In any case, two things about the negative reviews. First, Smoque is not in Portage Park, and consequently, the good ratings are not because they are. Don't any of you yelpers know Chicago at all? Second, it is hard for me to believe that portion sizes are too small for people. If they are not for me, believe me, they are not for most normal people.
