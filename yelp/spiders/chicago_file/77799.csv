Little Goat Diner////I tend to be a Yelper that leans to the high side of stars.  Nothing I enjoy more than a well-made cocktail, delicious food and enjoyable service. My first visit to Little Goat scores really well in two of those areas but was sadly disappointing in the third. Adrienne made a 5-star Old-Fashioned!  One of the best I have had. The Apple Gjetost Pie with Vanilla ice cream was divine!  So fresh, so autumn and so delicious. We sat at the bar and the service was seriously lacking and not engaging. We sat down more than one hour before closing and the bar staff was very focused on clean up, not on the customer experience. Real disappointing to write this one.   Likely won't be back, as service in my opinion far outweighs the product.
