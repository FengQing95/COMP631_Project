Smoque BBQ////We ordered the rib sampler (baby back and st louis) and they were both very good.  All the sides were very good as well.  Maybe not the best BBQ i've tasted in my life, but top 5 for sure. The BYO feature is fun, brought a 6pk of goose island to enjoy. The only thing prohibiting this place from getting a 5 is the atmosphere.  I figure a place with food this good could afford to spend a little more on the atmosphere?
