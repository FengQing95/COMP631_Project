Little Goat Diner////Went to Little Goat after hearing mixed reviews from friends.  The decor is great, and I really liked the vibe.  The uniforms for the waiters were a tad odd though, I thought.  Why all the same color? The food was standard diner fare, with some twists.  Honestly, I don't think it's much better than other diners in the area.  I would take people from out of town to Lou Mitchells before I would take people to Little Goat.
