Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I really liked this place. It was fun, the food was interesting and the variety was big. We were a group of about 15 people, we all ordered a few dishes, and tried off each other. I would recommend for bonding and meeting new people if you are into sharing. The Palleya was really good.
