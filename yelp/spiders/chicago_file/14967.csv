Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The recommended pizza was the Malnato Chicago Classic deep dish which I thought was very hearty and a delight to eat but felt like it feel short of delivering that "wow" factor. I just think with most deep dish pizzas, it's difficult for each of the ingredients to be tasted because it is muddled with all the cheese and tomato sauce. But don't get me wrong, the pizza was not unappetizing or tasteless -- it just wasn't my type of pizza. Probably out of the few places I have tried a deep dish pizza, Lou Malnati's was the best one.
