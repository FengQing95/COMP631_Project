Little Goat Diner////Some folks, including me, were slated to have the vegetarian version of the menu and it was so good that all the meat eaters asked to have a second taste of my dishes! While others had scallops I had the falafel. It looked and was plated exactly like the scallops and it was the best falafel I've had in my life. My main dish was some oriental sesame and avocado garlic noodles and on of my guests put down his salmon and had to force me to give him a second go at my dish! All 40 people raved about the food and dessert and all 40 got their appetizers, drinks, dishes (sea bass, short ribs, scallops), desserts in perfect harmony. The service was friendly and worked like a synchronized swim team.
