Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////When I asked my buddy for one restaurant recommendation in this town, this was it. No resos and that meant almost a two hour wait (they had said 1 hr), which we filled with trying out some drinks. Biggest complaint for the evening was that they came to grab us for our table after the long wait, took us downstairs, and the host seemed surprised that table still wasn't ready and wasn't for 10 minutes. Â Bigger issue when you've already waited all that time.
