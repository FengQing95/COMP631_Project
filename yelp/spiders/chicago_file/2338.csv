The Purple Pig////The seating situation isn't much fun either. If you are a party of two, you can hope to get seated at a two top table but there are a few large communal tables. Our party of five was sat at just a table and it was a bit of an awkward setup as I was then seated across from someone who was not in our party and had a hard time hearing the others in our party. That and it was pretty horrible trying to get in & out from the table as quarters were very, very close.
