Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For 3 really hungry girls, we've ordered two 6 inch deep dish pizzas. One is the Malnati's Chicago Classic, a special house sausage, with extra cheese and vine ripen tomato sauce in butter crust. The other deep dish we've gotten was the vegetable pizza because one of the girls is a vegetarian. Okay, so the sausage pizza was just okay. The vegetable pizza was actually pretty good - veggies gave it more texture and crunch, which the pizza itself lacked. The butter crust, well it was buttery, but I wasn't too fond of it. Maybe the New Yorker me is spoiled by pizzas in NYC and found this deep dish pizza overrated?
