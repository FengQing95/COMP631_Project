Smoque BBQ////I also found it odd how the owner (or who I presumed to be the owner) is sort of on watch over his customers. His interactions seemed a bit odd/strange, acting almost like a statue in the corner. If an owner is out on the dining floor, I'm usually accustomed to seeing him ask how things are going/how the food is. Instead he was just sort of...there... Also not a fan of the seating method, but I guess they need to sort people when there's a line snaking out the door.
