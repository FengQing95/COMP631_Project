Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For starters, I have to say that I am an East Coast person and looooove pizza, but usually only thin-crust. I can't stand the super thick, dough-y, huge hunks of bread with a slight layer of sauce and mounds of cheese that they call, "Chicago style" pizza over here. BUT, I watch a lot of Anthony Bourdain and was aware that what passes for Chicago pizza outside of Chicago is not real Chicago pizza. So, I was more than willing to try any pizza place in the city (except maybe Uno's).
