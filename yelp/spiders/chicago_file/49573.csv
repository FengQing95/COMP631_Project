Smoque BBQ////sides...i'm a big sides person...you can't call it a perfect bbq without good sides, so the same best hold true for a bbq joint...and the sides here didn't disappoint...mac and cheese, delicious...baked in a tin with bread crumbs on top...simple, elegant, yum...baked beans, a little sweet but still good...and i already sang the praises of the cornbread...hand cut fries were also good...
