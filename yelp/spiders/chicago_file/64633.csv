Smoque BBQ////If you love BBQ (smoked meat), this is the place to go. I've tried many others in the city and so far this is my favorite. If you go online, you can view the menu. When you walk in to this place, it is not really big, so get there early. There is usually a long line. If you are getting take-out, just skip the line and head straight to the counter. I usually get the St. Louis style ribs (meatier than baby back) with the savory sauce on the side. If ribs are not your thing, you can always get the brisket and pulled pork. What ever you get you won't be disappointed.
