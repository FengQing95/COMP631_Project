Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I really liked this place! Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba has brunch options along with everything else. It's so perfect. I went for their brunch but also ordered a couple of dinner options. I ordered the hash (amazing with the egg and oozing yolk on top!), scallops (this was okay), beef short rib (really tender), pork belly kabob (pretty good), and the octopus (this was my favorite). I also ordered their sangria and a chocolate tart cake with vanilla ice cream. Service was also very good!
