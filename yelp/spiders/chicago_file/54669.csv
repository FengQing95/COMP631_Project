Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went there for brunch and can definitely say that it's one of my new favorites! My friend and I shared everything so we got to try a few things before deciding on the favorites. I would say that's a way to go! My only suggestion is to add some syrup to the French toast which otherwise was a little dry.
