Art Institute of Chicago////The art institute is amazing. I love spending an afternoon here wandering the different exhibits. For a few years, I spent most weekends in Chicago and would always come to spend 2-3 hours looking at their permanent and rotating exhibits. There was always something new to see.  At $90, an annual membership was a great deal as a ticket for one person costs $18-20.  So after 4 visits, it pays for itself. For anyone who visits, my reco is to enter thru the modern wing as it's usually less crowded and the lines are shorter. Then you can continue going straight back to the visiting exhibits or wander thru the Asian arts back to the main building to see the iconic permanent paintings like American Gothic. My favorite exhibits are the contemporary paintings, the sculpture garden and the Asian sculptures. You can get so close and see the detail and the museum goers seem to be trained well enough that they don't tip things over. The museum is so spacious that it never really feels like it's crowded even in the summer when it's most crowded. There is also usually a cool rotating exhibit in the basement of the main building. And like most art museums, the building itself is amazing especially the modern Wing and the bridge connecting it to millennium park
