Little Goat Diner////I've been here twice: once the day after I competed in a triathlon (you can bet I was still hungry the next day) and the other this past weekend with my boyfriend. I'll focus mostly on my most recent dining experience here because it's most salient. It was a Saturday at around 6, which is prime time for dinner. The last time I had come to Little Goat, I had had a reservation, so I had reservations about coming without one (heh). We actually originally had put our names down for dinner at Au Cheval where the wait time was THREE HOURS. We were already hungry and Little Goat was also on our list of places to go in the West Loop, so we thought we would drop by to see if the wait time was better. And it was! Much to our excitement, we were seated immediately at the bar at Little Goat. Score!
