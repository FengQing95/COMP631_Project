Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////It is loud, which could be a drawback if you're not expecting it, but everything else is so great it doesn't matter.  We had pitchers of both the red and the peach sangrias, both delicious.  Our table of 5 ordered at least twelve different tapas and all were fantastic.  Favorites included lamb with basil, empanadas, caesar salad with ham, stuffed mushrooms, goat cheese in tomato sauce, citrus cooked salmon...all were very good though.
