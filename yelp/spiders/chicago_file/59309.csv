Smoque BBQ////The best BBQ I've had in Chicago. But the place is way too small for the crowd it draws - we ordered but had to wait for almost 20 minutes to sit down! The ribs were just right - crusty on the outside but juicy and tender. The pulled pork didn't have as much flavor as I wanted to see, but the "Texas sausage" was excellent. I didn't think the much-heralded mac n cheese lived up to expectations, but the vinegary cole slaw was out of this world. The sauce was good, but I would've liked a variety - sometimes I like sweet, sometimes spicy, etc.
