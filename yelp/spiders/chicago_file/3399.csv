The Purple Pig////We ordered a good amount of dishes which is why I love tapas. They also have a pretty good wine list! We started off with the pork shoulder and razor clams. Pork shoulders was definitely the highlight of my dinner. The pork was super tender served on top of mashed potatoes. The razor clams were good too however I prefer the asian-style razor clams. Next up was beets, broccoli, foie gras, octopus, turkey leg, and ended the night with bone marrow. Coming from a person who's not a fan of beets, their beets were really good. I thought the broccoli and octopus were okay! The turkey leg was amazing - super moist and full of flavor. The bone marrow was the best I've ever had especially with the buttered toast.
