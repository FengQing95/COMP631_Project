Smoque BBQ////If you like pulled pork, it's a must try. It melts in your mouth tender, and the flavor is amazing. You get a couple different bbq sauces, I enjoy both very much. The Carolina style goes great poured on the pork and I actually like dipping my sandwich and fries in the Memphis (can't get enough bbq) I love the brisket as well, but I prefer the pork.
