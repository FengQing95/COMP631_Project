Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////First up was sangria and we had a 1/2 pitcher of the passion fruit, and a 1/2 pitcher of the pear which was their special that night. Passion fruit OMG yes, pear just so-so. Regardless it got the job done and was the perfect compliment to our dinner! Ohh, our dinner. Let me do a rundown of the 238 menu items we ordered. At this point with 1031 reviews I'm not so sure it's necessary, but I'm going to go for it anyway.
