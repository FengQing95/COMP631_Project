Little Goat Diner////My hopes and dreams were then shattered with my mushroom burger. The medium beef patty I ordered came out mid well at best and had a severe lack of seasoning. Damn you line cook!!!  Damn you!  My partners patty melt had the same issue. The server was great and apologetic.  Nothing to argue about, it was way overcooked. The offer was made to redo and I declined. Just suggested  to help the cook learn from the mistake. I have no patience to wait on another and my appetite isn't that big.
