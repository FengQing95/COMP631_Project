Art Institute of Chicago////I've been an Art Institute member for many years and I'm just now getting around to reviewing. It is my favorite museum in Chicago and it is truly wonderful. I love that it sprawls all over the place and that the galleries and wings have different vibes depending on the architecture and collections displayed. You could just wander around and people watch and have a very nice time even if you didn't look at the art.
