Little Goat Diner////This restaurant definitely deserves a 5 star rating for its service and food quality but the price point seemed a bit high. In my humble opinion, a restaurant self described as being a diner shouldn't charge high end sit down restaurant prices. But then again, with an average of 45 minute waiting list, they probably need to charge more to keep the hipsters away.
