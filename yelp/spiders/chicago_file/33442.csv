Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The drinks merit mixed rankings.  Among our party of four people we sample and shared the Death in the Afternoon, M. Laurent, French 75, and of course the Negroni for a basis of comparison.  The Death in the Afternoon was a perfect absinthe drink; no more need be said.  The M. Laurent was the butter sweetness you think it would be, with a rich and oily texture.  The French 75 was actually the only true aperitif, leaving a freshly cleansed palate for your meal with citrus-pine combination.  Refreshing.  However, the Negroni failed on execution--not ingredient.  Instead of a Negroni, I got sugar water with a fresh grass aftertaste.  Not so good.
