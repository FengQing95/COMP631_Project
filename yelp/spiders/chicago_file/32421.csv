Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We wanted to visit Chicago last year but due to the pandemic, we couldn't. So a few days ago, I ordered from Tastes of Chicago and had six 9" deep dish pizzas sent to me in California. I figured even though we weren't able to travel there, at least we could have a taste of what deep dish pizza is like from Chicago.
