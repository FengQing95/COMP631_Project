Little Goat Diner////I honestly believe that this place sits right in the middle. It's not the worst that I've had but there wasn't anything that made me want to jump for joy. The patty melt was pretty traditional and pretty greasy. So, if grease and mediocre food are ok with you- you should be fine.
