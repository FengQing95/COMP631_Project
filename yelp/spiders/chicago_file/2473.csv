The Purple Pig////SERVICE:  Very good.  Seems like sheer coincidence that our server had lived on Maui for a few years before making the decision to reside in Chicago.  After discovering this Hawaii connection, he greeted us with a local Hawaii term, "howzit."  This of course had me chuckling a bit, and it seemed the meal was off to a good start.  Our server was clearly knowledgeable about the menu and offered excellent suggestions about the food and drink.  The server and his helpers periodically checked on us throughout the meal, refilled waters, and cleared dishes in a timely manner.  Overall, excellent service during our visit.
