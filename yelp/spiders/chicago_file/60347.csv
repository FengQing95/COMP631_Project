Smoque BBQ////The first time I was there, instead of going for the usual ribs, I decided to sample their brisket. Huge fan of brisket. The first time I had it Â I had the sliced brisket sandwich. It tasted so delicious! Loved the BBQ sauce on the side with it. The next time I went I had the chopped brisket. Just as good as the sliced.
