Art Institute of Chicago////Anyways, the museum is a bit strict on their rules.  We brought Jimmy John's subs in our backpack and the coat room wouldn't hold it for us (food would go bad, whatever).  So, we had to carry the backpack in front rather than on our back.  The umbrella sticking out of the backpack was a no-no for potential knocking over things.  So, we had to check in the umbrella for $1 which wasn't too bad.  To add further to the story, we tried to eat our subs at the downstairs café.  Well, the staff shooed us away from the tables to the benches by the bathrooms.  I guess it wasn't too bad since they could have kicked us outside the museum.  Also, staff was very particular on all the signage such as drinking water in the outside café next to the sculpture garden.
