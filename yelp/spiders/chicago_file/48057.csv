Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is great for groups. We went for a friends birthday and had an excellent server. Try the favorites on the menu (featured in red) patatas bravas and braised short ribs. The goat cheese, calamari, mushrooms, and desserts were also all fabulous. Add a glass of sangria and you're set.
