Little Goat Diner////This restaurant is one of my favorite for brunch in Chicago. Their staff is incredibly accommodating and kind and the food is amazing. I'd recommend ordering something totally unhealthy and fun, it's definitely worth it. The best meals I've had here are the Spiced Apple Pancakes and the Fat Elvis Waffles.
