Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Best pancakes I have ever eaten. The wait time was 45 minutes to get seated, but once your food arrives you forget all about the wait time. Our waiter, Dustin, was super cool and friendly, adding helpful tips about what to order. I ordered the Mexicana skillet, that came with two buttermilk pancakes, and my boyfriend ordered the white chocolate raspberry pancakes. The skillet came with some tasty salsa. My boyfriend didn't finish his pancakes, but it's all good I finished them for him. The pancakes were really the stars of the show, then the skillet, and then our drinks the berry smoothie and mocha coconut coffee.
