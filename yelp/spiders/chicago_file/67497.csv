Little Goat Diner////A good dining experience, but not 4 stars. The restaurant had amazing natural lighting which I enjoyed most. I had the bulls eye French toast. While it wasn't bad, I wasn't amazed. Each of the components, the French toast and fried chicken, were great individually. I couldn't dig the combination of tastes though and for that it only gets 3 stars. My girlfriend had "this little piggy went to China", again the attempt to merge tastes, here, Asian spices with normal American foods didn't impress us. I probably wouldn't return again as it was overpriced and did not wow us. However, it's not bad.
