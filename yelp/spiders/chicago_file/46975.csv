Smoque BBQ////Unfortunately most people in the upper Midwest believe good bbq is made from boiling ribs. Not so. I have been to the best hole in wall bbq joints in the south, Smoque ranks at the top with Whole Hog in Little Rock, Lewling's in Houston, Sonny Bryan's in Dallas, Arthur Bryant in KC, Corky's in Memphis, et al. Smoque's brisket is the best of all..ultra tender. Pulled Pork is near the top too. Ribs are good, but Smoke Daddy may be better. Sides are great...mac & cheese, beans, cobbler. I have not tried the sausage. BTW...the sandwich buns are off the charts. Be smart about when you go. Weekdays @ 2pm would be a good idea. Â This place is for serious BBQ lovers who understand and appreciate smoke cooking. If you want boiled meat...eat a hot dog!!
