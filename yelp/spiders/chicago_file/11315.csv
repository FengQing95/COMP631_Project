Art Institute of Chicago////Simply beautiful! Such a vast amount of art and very diverse as well. The exhibitions are very organized and the space is wonderful. I definitely recommend getting an audio tour added to your ticket to get the full experience. You get to listen to the curator speak about certain pieces of the art and there are wooden benches to sit on while you listen.
