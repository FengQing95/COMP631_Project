Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Wow. This place is everything yelp says it is.  I went here on a sunday morning around 9AM (just before) and there was a 45 minute wait already. No problem! I sat outside since the weather was decent, and after a while ordered a turtle mocha with an extra shot.  The coffe was very good, but it was pretty hot so I had to let it cool down.  About 45 minutes later I was called for my table. I guess the plus side of having to wait so long is that I already knew what I wanted.  I oredered the corn beef hash (side) and the chocolate chip belgian waffles.  The waffles were good but they weren't as crispy as I prefer(like true belgian waffles).  And for being "chocolate chip" they're just sprinkled with chocolate chips instead of being mixed into it.  Very good, but not amazing.  The corned beef hash was fantastic. I look for homemade hash in places like this, and they definitely deliver.  All in all a great experience. Definitely worth checking out.
