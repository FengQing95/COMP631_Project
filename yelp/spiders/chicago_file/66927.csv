Little Goat Diner////Nice option in West Loop for brunch (either in the morning or a midnight snack). Pretty big menu with a lot of both sweet and savory options. Everything I've tried is tasty and an interesting twist on diner/American food. The wait is definitely manageable, especially compared to other restaurants in the neighborhood.
