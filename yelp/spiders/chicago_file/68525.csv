Little Goat Diner////The menu is incredible - someday I will taste the Elvis waffle and try several of the unique sandwich options.  As a group we ate the fried pickles and onion rings (lightly battered and delicious), the cinnamon roll (gooey and delicious), their take on the sloppy Joe, the jerk burger and a steak sandwich.  All of which came in a generous portion size and were delicious.  Definitely bring your appetite to this place because it feels like home cooked comfort food... all you need is a lazy boy for after the meal.  While you are at it - you might as well put away a shake or malt along with your meal as they are delicious.
