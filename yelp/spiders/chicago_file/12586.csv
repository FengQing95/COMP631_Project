Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My friends and I were at your River North location on July 5th. We ordered a deep dish and a thin crust along with a bunch of other items. We knew about the long wait for the pizzas however after about 40 minutes our server (Matt) tells us he dropped our pizzas. He apologized and says we'll have to wait another 30 minutes for our pizzas but he'll buy them for us and we will not be charged for them. After our pizzas, we ordered dessert and waited another 30 minutes for dessert. We also asked for our check and that took another 30 minutes. We were all very unhappy with the service at this point. When the check finally came, we were charged for the two pizzas. We asked our server but he apologized and said "I spoke too soon" and tried to walk away. I asked him to get a manager and he said okay. Of course he never got a manager. I had to find the manager myself then explained everything to her. She finally took the pizzas off our check. Â I was bad enough that the pizzas were dropped, but making us wait another 30-40 minutes was unacceptable. The thin crust could have came out first or the server could have asked if we wanted anything else.
