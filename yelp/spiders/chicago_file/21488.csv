Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Since I was sure the first experience was a fluke, I ate there again but got their vegetarian special--can't remember the name. This was better than the traditional. I thought it had a better and more interesting flavor. The spinach/garlic flavor was nice against the robust sauce, but the crust was still bland.
