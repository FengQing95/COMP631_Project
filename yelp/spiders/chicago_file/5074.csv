The Purple Pig////Being in town from LA for a work conference, I attempted to splurge on one big time dinner spot (that attempt failed, but that's another story) so after careful consideration opted to try this place. Upon showing up without reservation, I soon realized what the reviews said: one of the trendiest restaurants in Chicago's River North/Loop area.
