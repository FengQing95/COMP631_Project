Little Goat Diner////Our waitress was a lovely girl who gave us some great recommendations. I decided to order the Bull's Eye French Toast. It was stellar! An egg is baked into the middle of each piece of french toast which is perfect for dipping the crispy fried chicken that comes with these waffles. The onion brioche paired with the barbecue maple syrup made the flavor of this dish extra special. This definitely will not be the last time I order Bull's Eye French Toast!
