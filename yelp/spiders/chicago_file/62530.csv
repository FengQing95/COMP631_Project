Smoque BBQ////I love the St Louis ribs and brisket. Â So tender that it falls off the bone. But I don't care forr the sides. They're too small except for ther French fries which come in a bag. The Mac and cheese is good but there isn't enough of it. The coleslaw needs to be chopped a little more. The baked beans are well seasoned but it's too small. Maybe a salad or spaghetti or corn on the cob. Break out of the tiny side dish mold.
