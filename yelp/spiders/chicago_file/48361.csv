Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Bloody Mary bar rocks!!!  I have been here twice visiting Chicago.  My first time there... I left wanting more.  The food was just absolutely fantastic.  That visit was a year ago.  This time around I came in for brunch again.  And I was a little disappointed.  The food wasn't as incredible as the first time.  I heard that they change up the menu often.  I was not as impressed with the changes.  They also removed some items from the menu too.  I did however super enjoy my bloody mary.  Also, we had a 21 person group.  I am not sure if maybe the food was affected for that reason.  We originally made a reservation for 15 and increased it by 6 people last minute.  Somehow, they allowed it!  We didn't all sit together, but it's ok, we were still close to one another.  I also checked in on Yelp for a goody.  Four Square also has check-in specials... you can't combine though.
