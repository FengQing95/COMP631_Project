Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I ate dinner at this restaurant last week and service at the bar was great, however, I was very disappointed in the food. The french fries and fried chicken were fried in pork grease and made me very ill. The restaurant should make you aware of what they are frying your food in; to avoid this problem in the future for your guests. Also, the steak didn't compare to other area steakhouses that I frequent. I am only giving two stars because of the excellent service, otherwise, I would not even give it one.
