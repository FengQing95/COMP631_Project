Art Institute of Chicago////My first introduction to the AIC came after walking twenty blocks in the wrong direction due to faulty instructions on how to reach the art institute. I showed up shivering and cold an hour before closing, cursing my lack of a proper jacket. Someone at the Bank of America took pity on me and bought me a tea, then the staff blithely overlooked the fact I clutched something in my frozen fingers and let me rush off through the hall of armour and glories to take a look at the ancient Greek and Roman display. That whirlwind adventure is an object lesson in how NOT to see the AIC.
