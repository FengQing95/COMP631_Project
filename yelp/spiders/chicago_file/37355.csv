Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////A well-deserved 5 stars all around for the food, drinks, vibes and service - literally A M A Z I N G!!! I came here with my boyfriend for my 23rd birthday on a Sunday night at 7pm. He had to make reservations a couple months in advance and we were so excited to finally try this place out given the 4.5 star Yelp rating.
