Art Institute of Chicago////As to the art, it's a magnificent place though some things are not well labelled nor intuitive to find. I had done a very long paper on Georges Seurat back in college and to finally see hist masterpiece in person was definitely a revelation. It was very nit what I expected. As I noted this to a friend, he says to do my best Cameron Frye on the painting. Very clever reference. Getting to see the Nighthawks was the other highlight as were the Post impressionist and many other pieces. As any wold class museum you could spend days in here. Just remember to double bag your sandwich. 4.5 stars
