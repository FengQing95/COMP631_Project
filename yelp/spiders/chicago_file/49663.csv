Smoque BBQ////I've been wanting to check out this BBQ joint for awhile and finally went last week.  Being a backyard BBQ smoker and former Texan I had doubts whether they could pull-off similar luscious brisket compared to Rudy's of Austin.  I was pleasantly surprised by the friendly and expedient service.  I ordered the brisket sandwich with a side of mac-n-cheese and absolutely loved the combination of flavors and smoke.  The brisket I ordered sliced and it came tender and juicy with a tangy side of their house BBQ sauce.  The crusted mac-n-cheese was also delicious and I could have definitely used more.  Smoque is by far the best BBQ place I've been to in the city of Chicago.  I can't wait to go back and try the ribs and pulled pork.  I also noticed they now have hot links which are imported from Rudy's in Texas.  Woo Hoo those are tasty spicy sausages!
