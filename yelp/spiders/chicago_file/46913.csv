Smoque BBQ////6. baked beans- hit and miss here. i have had them several times, but each time the recipe has seemed to have changed, sometimes too watery, sometimes they taste like yesterday's reheated beans. i am not sure whats going on with those- i have had them several times and they were perfect one time. just needs some consistency.
