The Purple Pig////What an experience. We were celebrating our anniversary and this place was recommended by a good friend! The food was amazing and the service on point! Pork liver pâté, the pork belly, the bread and meat and cheese plate were all so good! And....how can I forget the strawberry panna cotta! A perfect way to end a great experience
