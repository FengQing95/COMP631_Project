Art Institute of Chicago////When I come to portraits, I imagine the personalities behind the paintings as there always must be a painter and a subject. And more often than not there's a history, nudity automatically creates an alternate universe and way of relating as does a rental agreement. Strangely,I have found mention of, in different centuries even, painters painting for their lodging and being evicted because of the end result. Painting like this apparently leads to homelessness-she was either very ugly or the painter more in need of a model than a roof.
