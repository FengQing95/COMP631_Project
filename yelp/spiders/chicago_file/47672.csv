Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The tapas selection is great and the food is good. On a busy saturday night though, service can be a little slow. We had a large party of about 15, so I'm taking that into consideration. Definitely a Good date night or group outing spot. It looks small on the outside, but has room indoors. Though they cram you in.
