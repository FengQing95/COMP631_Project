Smoque BBQ////I found this place due to all the amazing yelp reviews, but I was not as impressed as I thought I would be. The St. Louis ribs & the brisket was tender, but the sauces were just "okay". The sauce really makes or breaks the meal. The sides were small, but the fries were plenty. The peach cobbler was also my favorite part of the meal. If only they include a scoop of vanilla ice cream, that would really hit the spot. The service was amazing though. The server was very attentive. We were very pleased. I also love when parking is free. Just park along the roads nearby.
