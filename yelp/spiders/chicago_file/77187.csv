Little Goat Diner////This is my first Stephanie Izard restaurant and it did not disappoint. It was a lovely setting with indoor and outdoor seating. They also provided a vegan menu without us asking for it so that was nice. I'm a vegetarian, but ended up ordering from the vegan menu - the scallion pancake dish was very filling and colorful. I loved it!
