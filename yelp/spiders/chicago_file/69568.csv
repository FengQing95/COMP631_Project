Little Goat Diner////I don't know you but I love you Stephanie Izard. Girl & The Goat is probably my favorite restaurant in Chicago so I was thrilled when Little Goat opened up. They have an expansive menu with all different options served all day, which is typically concerning but they deliver! Everything I have had has been delicious! I've only been a few times but the highlights have been the nachos, patty melt and chocolate malt shake.
