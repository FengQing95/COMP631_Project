Art Institute of Chicago////There were a few times where I wished phone calls or emails could have been returned a little quicker, but that's just how anxious brides are.  There was never anything that was missed or went unreturned for more than a few days.  Also, we had to sign the contract before the tasting which was a little nerve wracking, but I can assure you, you will LOVE the food! (and it's just as good when prepared for 150 people as for 2.) Also, we could only pick one entree (plus a veggie option) which was a little strange, but we went with the steak (which is the same price as the chicken or fish) and didn't receive a single complaint - in fact people couldn't stop raving.  Also, the pasta for the vegetarians was not just an after thought, it may have been better than the steaks, and that's saying something!
