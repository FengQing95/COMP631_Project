Smoque BBQ////Once I walked in, I was surprised to see the restaurant lay out. I was expecting a full service restaurant, but it was order and pay at front and sit whereever kinda thing. There was a guy from the restaurant guiding everybody and making sure everyone had tables, which was super helpful.
