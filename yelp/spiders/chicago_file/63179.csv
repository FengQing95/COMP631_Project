Smoque BBQ////For most true barbecue lovers, the drink of choice is either a cold beer or sweet tea and it's in that department that Smoque misses out on the fifth star.  Their sweet tea is colored water with not enough flavor to pass the blindfolded taste test. And what's with those three gulp paper cups they provide for your drinks? Having to stand in line for refills (the tea and soft drink dispenser are in a crowded corner) is an unnecessary waste of time (always a long line waiting) and results in the table being tied up longer than necessary.  Bigger glasses please.
