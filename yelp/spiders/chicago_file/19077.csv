Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I came here under recommendations from a few locals, and I was not disappointed! Their deep dish pizza is amazing! Butter crust, layers of cheese and sausage, I was pretty much in heaven! Definitely affordable too! I'm glad the others in my party were getting full, because I definitely wanted seconds!
