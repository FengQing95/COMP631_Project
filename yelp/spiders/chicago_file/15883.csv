Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I wish I could say I've tried their appetizers or salads, but I will avoid food all day just to have room for two or three pieces of their amazing pizza.  Get the butter crust.  It takes a little longer, but it is soooo worth it.  Especially if you're a Chicago-style pizza virgin!  You will be ruined for all other deep-dish pizzas.
