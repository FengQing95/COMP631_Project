Smoque BBQ////We tried two different kind of ribs.  Saint Louis was the better one and really good.  The coleslaw was also awesome and this is coming from a guy who doesn't like coleslaw.  The fries were also crispy and yummy.  The apple cobblers were a great way to end a very delicious dinner meal.
