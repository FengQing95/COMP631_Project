Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As for the location, I like this one because it is smaller and doesn't have the long wait times that you find at other places.  I've always found the service to be good.  The atmosphere is laid back; you can have a conversation with others in your party at a comfortable speaking volume.  There are so many good choices for pizza in Chicago; this is a good one.
