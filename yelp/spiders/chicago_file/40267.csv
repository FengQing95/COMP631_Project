Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////WOW! Absolutely blown away! Celebrated my 30th birthday here and it was one of the best meals we have EVER had in Chicago- maybe truly the best! Service was impeccable, ambiance and decor was incredibly cozy and detailed (as all Hogsalt restaurants are). The sourdough and butter house bread was one of the best pieces of sourdough I've ever had- so warm and fresh with the best crust. We started with the crab stuffed avocado salad and crab cake. The salad was delicious and refreshing. The crab cake at $30 is pretty high, but it was very thick, and almost 100% crab meat (SO GOOD), so definitely worth the price! The steak was cooked to perfection. My husband thinks it was the best steak he has ever had. The fried chicken was impossibly crispy, the mashed potatoes and gravy with it were creamy, rich, absolutely divine. The sundae speaks for itself- such a fun dessert! I can't thank Bavette's enough for one of the best dining experience we have ever had! Set a reminder on your phone for 30 days before your desired date to make a reservation- otherwise it's hard to get in, and we understand why. Thank you again!
