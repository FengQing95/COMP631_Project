Smoque BBQ////I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could.  This is a great place for lunch.  Not so vegetarian friendly but for the carnivores out there this place is heaven.  Delicious BBQ and the best fries in the neighborhood.  I will be back and often.  I recommend the pulled pork sandwich.  Slaw is good too, it's oil based not creamy.  From what I hear everything is great here.   There was no line when I went but I hear sometimes it's out the door.  If only they were BYOB, I'd give em' five stars.
