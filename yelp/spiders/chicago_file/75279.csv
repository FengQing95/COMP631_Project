Little Goat Diner////+Pork Belly Croquette: Oh my gosh, this was so delicious. The croquette and the smashed avocado had a really rich flavor and a mushy texture, but it was perfectly balanced out by crunch and acidity of the pickled vegetables on top. There were also two runny eggs that normally I would feel slightly queasy about, but I didn't even mind them at all! I would totally order this again.
