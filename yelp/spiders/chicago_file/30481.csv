Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pizza was Very good. I'm glad we ordered a small. It is a lot of food. Beer is a tad overpriced. Do plan to wait at least 40-50 min for the pizza to come out. If you are a larger party they place your order before they find a table which means you wait a lot less once you sit. So if they sit you right away. Don't be suprised if ppl sit and get fiod before you do. I think they have just been Lobby waiting as long as you did.
