Little Goat Diner////I have been to Little Goat 3 times now and tried something different each time.  It's wonderful.  Most recently I ordered The Tofu Griddle because the ingredients sounded great.  (I'm not even vegetarian, this is only the second time in my life I ate Tofu).  It was UNBELIEVABLE.  My boyfriend gets the Bull's Eye French Toast every time.  You literally cannot go wrong here.
