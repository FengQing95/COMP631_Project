Smoque BBQ////Smoque was everything you want in a BBQ place. Every single item that we had on the menu was pretty great! The mac and cheese was a bit on the sandy, crumbled cheese side and not as rich and creamy as you'd like but the sliced brisket was EXCELLENT. Their sauces were obviously great (assuming that would make or break a BBQ joint) and I poured every ounce on my baby backs. The ribs themselves had a great charred smoked flavor but I'd say they were a tad stuck on the bone compared to others I've had. I would say that the seating arrangements aren't the greatest, as I bumped and rubbed up on my neighbor as I sexually moaned and groaned as I devoured my lunch (This is just me getting picky). All in all, it's great!
