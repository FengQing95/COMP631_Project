Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The quality of the ingredients cannot be disparaged, the taste and the texture satisfies as well. I did notice a bit of water around the edge of the crust and the toppings, like it hadn't quite set yet. It actually did get better as it sat for 10 minutes or so. Good stuff. I actually preferred the "lou", even after hearing about and tasting the much heralded sausage in the delux (mind you , it was good). I think it was the slight bit of cheddar they use in the lou that gives it a bit of zing. normally I have no interest in cheddar on a pizza, but this worked.
