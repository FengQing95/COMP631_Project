Smoque BBQ////My chopped briscuit was piled high and deep on two rich pieces of bread, so I trimmed down the mountain of meat using my fork.  I felt bad when I eventually dipped the morsels in the side of BBQ sauce, because the meat tasted fantastic without it....but I craved more flavor!  The mac and cheese was just a bit too cheesy for me but what the heck, I made quick work of that as well.
