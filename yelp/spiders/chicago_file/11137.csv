Art Institute of Chicago////It feels very open with lots of glass but warm with wood elements. All the art and exhibits feel accessible to you although you can't touch them. I felt like the layout allowed for a much more intimate experience with what they exhibited. My favorite was the Chagall stained glass window which was beautiful!
