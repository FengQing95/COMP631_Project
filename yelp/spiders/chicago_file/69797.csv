Little Goat Diner////Garlic mashed potatoes were...garlic mashed.  Taste like the ones at Applebees.  Which is not a bad thing...I like the garlic mashed potatoes at Applebees.  But I'm not expecting them at Little Goat, because I certainly wasn't getting a 2 for $20 special here...and now let's get to those tempura mashed potatoes.  These weren't just outside the box.  After leaving the box, who ever came up with this concept proceeded to take said box they were now outside of, and launch it into outer space.  It was like mashed potatoes, deep fried, with an asian flair.  Uh....ok, maybe I can go with this concept, but then it's paired with ranch (great, I love ranch, but not necessarily with Asian-inspired flavors) and then went with a rather unpleasant-tasting "barbeque" sauce, and I am being kind.    I'm sorry, I don't know what this was, but it tasted like watered-down ketchup, mixed with Arby's sauce packets, then mixed with a whole lot of vinegar.  We all were not fans.
