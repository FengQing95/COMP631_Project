Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Although people may think that this place is over-rated, I truly think it is a go-to staple.  With a large group of people, or just a catch up with one or two friends, this restaurant can be a great time.  I am a fan of their sangria and there are definitely some great tapas choices.  My recommendations are the shrimp with red pepper flakes, always get the goat cheese, the tenderloin with the blue cheese, and the croquettes are always my favorites!
