Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I came here twice while I was in town, the second time because I got a personal pizza previously and it wasn't quite what I was hoping for. I think the deep dish here is good. But nothing really to write home about. It's a nice place to have a dinner with family or friends though. I do remember that their sauce is very wine-y which is hit or miss.
