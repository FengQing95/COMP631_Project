Art Institute of Chicago////The museum loses a star from me, because I hate paying for museums! (Smithsonian museums in DC are FREE) The museum offers a couple free days; now it's Thursday and Friday evenings from 5 -8pmish, but the free days change periodically so I would check out the website before heading there sans cash. As I am cheap and like free educational experiences, I have never paid to go to the Art Institute and have been at least 5 times. Also means I haven't seen many of the special exhibits. I'm sure they're great though if you don't mind spending money.
