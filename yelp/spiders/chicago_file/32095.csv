Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The food came and definitely lifted our spirits, but not even into the second slice, Tony came by and handed us the check. We were planning on trying the tiramisu, but maybe next time! He did the same to the table behind us, who complained that they were not done, which we could tell even from our table. He did apologize after bringing back the check, which also took a while, but the damage had been done.
