Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago by far!!!!! Love the whole tapas thing, they have really good sangria, and spacy potatoes. Good thing they have valet parking because you will never find parking on that area, also made sure you made reservation or you will wait 1 hour. But this is a place to go especially during that summer!
