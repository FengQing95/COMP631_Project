The Purple Pig////As for the food, deviled egg was delish. It wasn't heavy like others I've had before. Crispy smashed potatoes with feta cheese dipping sauce was so freaking good. I think it was one of the best things I ate in Chicago. Octopus was good but the veggies that came with it were too salty. There was a dish of pork belly, thigh, some crispy chip and veggies, which I didn't really like (it's called porcelet on my receipt).
