Little Goat Diner////Food: we weren't starving and only shared the nachos. They make the chips in house and they're delicious but unfortunately get a little soggy by the time you get to the bottom. The pork was on the bottom of the plate as opposed to the top which effected the flavor towards the end. I wish the dish was constructed a bit differently so I could get every flavor with every bite; i didn't get to taste the pork until we were halfway done with the plate and that was a bit frustrating. Overall, the dish was quite tasty.
