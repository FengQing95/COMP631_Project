Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've only had Lou Malnati's a handful of times, but two of those times were over the weekend at Lollapalooza which is what inspired this review.  In a sea of the overpriced beer and food that made up the Lollapalooza "chow town", Lou Malnati's was a shining beacon of affordable hope.  With $3.00 slices for cheese, pepperoni or sausage you could easily fill yourself up for less than the price of a single can of bud light (lower case because I don't consider it to be worthy of a proper noun).
