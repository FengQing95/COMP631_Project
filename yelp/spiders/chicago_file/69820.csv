Little Goat Diner////I finally got some odd thing that was basically, a roti bread folded and stood on end with eggs under it, avocado, some sweet sauce garnish and a bunch of frisee on top. Really? does anyone try these things before they eat them? you can't just put together savory and sweet willy nilly and assume it'll be "unique" and thereby good. I wanted breakfast but everything is a la carte and they tell you all about it like that's a bonus. So it means I need to put together my own breakfast plan because they don't know how to do it. It also means every individual greasy thing is $5 alone so you can spend $25 easy basically just to getting extra oil and little plates for it.
