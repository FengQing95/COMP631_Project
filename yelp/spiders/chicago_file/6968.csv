Art Institute of Chicago////A full day of culture and then some.  I have been to art museums around the world and I would place this one high on my "must see" list.  The exhibits are very well laid out with plenty of background information accompanying the displayed works.  I was most impressed with the artifacts from Asia.  One thing to note is that they do not allow any bags to be carried into the institute that are larger than 11x17.  They will require you to check an oversized bag at the ticket counter.  They do allow photography but flash, tripods and video recording is not permitted.  As with most of the popular Chicago attractions, it is best to arrive just as they open in the morning.  If you don't, the lines will be long and you might not be able to cover everything in one day.
