Smoque BBQ////My husband loved his food but my food was just ok . I've had better bbq at home the taste of the food and the way it look was just ok . I ordered peach cobbler even that was just ok I've seen seen peach cobbler made with peanuts baked on top of it . My husband however loved his briskets other than that I have nothing else to say about this place
