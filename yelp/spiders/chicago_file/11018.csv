Art Institute of Chicago////With free Thursday evenings for Illinois residents (from 5PM to 8PM) you really have no excuse not to visit the the Art Institute.  They have art to cater to any taste: sculpture, paintings, furniture, modern, ...old. Can you tell how cultured I am?  Anyway, looking at the art is always fun, I like how in some of the exhibits you can get very close to the art (without touching of course) without it being behind glass.
