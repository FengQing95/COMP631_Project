Little Goat Diner////4 of us went for brunch on Labor Day and my brilliant friends had walked over to put our name down an hour before we were meeting.  Our table was ready 5 minutes after we walked in.  Due to the Labor Day rush, they were running a 1-2 hour delay on grits so Shrimp & Grits was off the menu.  But we did get a side of grits at the end of the meal and it was phenomenal.
