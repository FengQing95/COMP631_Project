Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Firstly, lets clarify that there are TWO types of deep dish pizza in Chicago. One is a thinner butter crust (Giordanos, Gino's East, Lou Malnati's) and the other type is a thicker more-doughy pie-crusty (Uno, Due, and I think Pequod's though I haven't been here yet). Obviously, everyone has a preference to which type of deep dish they prefer, but I feel people who say Lou Malnati's is so much better than Uno or visa versa are comparing apples and oranges.
