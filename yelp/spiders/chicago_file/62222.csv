Smoque BBQ////Let me start off by saying that I love ribs.  I could eat them every day, but I was not  impressed with the ribs at Smoque.  I like ribs that are falling off the bone and every time I have given them another try, I find myself ripping the meat off and scared I am going to lose a tooth in the process!
