Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////If you check in on foursquare, you get a free pintxos platter. A $9 value, pretty awesome deal. 6 bite size tapas for free! The goat cheese croqueta was one of my favorites. It was oozing and delicious. The mushroom and rice croqueta was also very good. The short rib stuffed piquillo pepper was too spicy for me, skip it.
