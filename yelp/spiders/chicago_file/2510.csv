The Purple Pig////I like that I wasn't too full from eating and that I got to try different things (it was around 30 a person). If I'm ever back in chicago I'd def come back and try the other dishes. It's super nice decor inside but not pretentious at all. Cozy place! When I was walking out I overheard the other table saying how much they loved this place as well.
