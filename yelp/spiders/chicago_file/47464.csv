Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////It's everything I want from a restaurant. My new go to, I wish I would have found you sooner. Food was fast and delicious. Service was amazing, the lighting and decor were PERFECT. Passion fruit sangria =dangerously delicious. My favorite dishes were the garlic shrimp and the garlic potato salad. I almost don't want to write a review so I can keep this restaurant all to myself.
