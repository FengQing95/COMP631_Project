Little Goat Diner////I would not go back for the burgers. I teetered between a 4 and 5 for this place, but I couldn't give them a 5 because my experience was not at that level, due in part to the prices, service, and quality of the food ordered. If I were to go again, or were to make a suggestion to anyone, order a breakfast specialty!
