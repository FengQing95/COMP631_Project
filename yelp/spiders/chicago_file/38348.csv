Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////ICE CREAM - I choose the salted caramel and chocolate combination (you get two scoops so you can choose for each of the scoops).  Brandon brought out both the hot fudge and goldbrick sauce for us to try.  SOOOO good!  I particularly liked the dark rich hot fudge, but the goldbrick sauce was not too far behind.  This came out with a sparkler for my birthday.
