Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Hmm reasons why I like the place... 1.)  name is fun to say  2.) even waiting for a table can turn into fun if you get a pitcher 3.) I like to share food  4.) coconut sponge cake desert thing  and 5.) I get leye points for my dining experience.  I don't think it can get any better then that.  Foodstuffs that I recommend... chicken curry salad, beef skewers, anything with shrimp, goat cheese dish, lobster paella, sangria, sangria, sangria, and coconut cake, yummmmy!
