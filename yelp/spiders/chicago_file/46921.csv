Smoque BBQ////I don't know what ya'll are Smoque-in, but Smoque is a joke for BBQ. I went with a Texan and we both agreed the best thing we had was the sixpack of beer we brought in. He tried the brisket and I had the pulled pork... The pork was dry and flavorless. I tried their "BBQ sauce"... Well I actually mean their taco bell sauce. Seriously it really tastes like Taco Bell sauce. The owner could see I didn't like the sauce and brought me two other sauces. Still no better. Really runny and really bad flavor. The corn bread was dry and flavorless. The cole slaw was vinegary and soggy, but not a good soggy. The actual best part of the food we had was the BBQ beans. Was the only thing I cared to finish... All in all a bust. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone for any reason. Go to Fat Willy's. Even Twin Anchors is better, Even carson's.... Â  How there is always a line there, I don't know, but I guess you fans have never had truly good BBQ!
