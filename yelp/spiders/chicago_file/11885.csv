Art Institute of Chicago////Worth the price of a trip to Chicago! This museum is amazing and while some of the workers are a tad rude, the art doesn't snap at you or yell at you, so if you can ignore the nastiness it is amazing! Seeing some of the amazing art that I teach my high schoolers about every year brought tears to my eyes.
