Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I am embarrassed to say since moving to chicago 4.5 years ago i have never had chicago deep dish pizza.  that all changed last night, we had a friend in from out of town who wanted it and i decided to put my fears aside and dig in. You know what, it was DELICIOUS!  butter crust, lots of cheese and sauce, what's not to love?  I dont think my waistline will allow me to eat this all that often but it was a great indulgence.
