Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Im giving 4 Stars based on the ambiance alone. Booked reservations 2 months ahead for my husband 50th birthday dinner. Arrived on time for my 5pm reservation, was warmly greeted & told to take a seat & I will be seated shortly. Around 10 mins later, was lead downstairs to a much smaller & intimate space. Absolutely Beautiful!!! Dimly lit, nice jazz-like music playing, reminding me of a Speakeasy. After that, everything else was just mediocre. My server was Great, can't recall his name. My cocktails, bread & apps came out immediately & were delicious but after that, I waited appx 30 mins for my main course: 22oz Ribeye, med well, Elotes Style Corn, Loaded Baked Potatoe & Charred Brussel Sprouts. I expected this meal to be Phenominal, based on all the previous reviews as well as how long it took me to get reservations at a decent time AND on a weekend but I was not taken aback at all!! Steak was just OK, corn was nothing special nor was baked potatoe. Brussel Sprouts too salty. The only dish that came out HOT, after all the time we waited, was the potatoe.
