Smoque BBQ////This place did not disappoint!  I've been here 4 more times since I first initial visit.  I'm in love with the baby back ribs and the brisket!  Literally ife changing! It's absolutely delicious!  Pulled pork is amazing too.  Love both of their sauces too.  Just tried their brisket chili and it's awesome!  I'll be going back for more of that when the weather becomes more brisk during football season!  They have the only peach cobbler I'll eat.  I like it because it's more like a peach crisp than a true cobbler.  The corn bread is good.  Baked beans are good. Mac n cheese is good.
