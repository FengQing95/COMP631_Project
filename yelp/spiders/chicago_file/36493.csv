Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Entering Bavette's is an experience, it immediately reminds me of a lot of old stately restaurants in Washington DC, or an English gentlemen's club (I should clarify that there are no strippers in gentlemen's clubs in England. They are for the upper classes.  But that said, why do Americans call strip clubs "gentlemen's clubs" anyway?  I mean, if you're going in these places, you're hardly a gentleman, ogling women and salivating over reproductive organs. And frankly, I don't think the "dancers" really want you to act like a gentleman!  In fact, if a gentleman tried to defend their virtue, that's likely more than the dancer has ever done, right? Ok, I got that from Groucho Marx, but I digress.... )
