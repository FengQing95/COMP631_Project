Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Love, love, love this place!!! I have been here twice, once with just the hubby We went with a large group for a gluttonous dinner and tried a huge variety of tapas. All of them were fantastic. While there, we also sampled 4 types of sangria. My favorite was the raspberry. Service was excellent and the price was more than reasonable.
