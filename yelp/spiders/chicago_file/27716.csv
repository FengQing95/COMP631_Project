Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Since I was in Chicago, I had to try the deep dish pizza. Believe it or not, some girl gave us a free pizza at the music festival going on! It was absolutely delicious and the tomato sauce and cheese had great flavor. The crust wasn't too overpowering, but had the perfect crunch. If you're looking for a good deep dish, here's the place to go!
