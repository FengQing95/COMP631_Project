Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After a lengthy plane ride and finally making it into downtown Chicago after what seemed to be the longest stop-and-go city traffic, my sisters and I finally made our way to authentic a Chicago deep dish pizzeria. Be prepared to wait at least 1.5 hours especially during peak dinner time. We put our name down at the front desk, then went to the right hand side to order our pizza, so by the time we got a table it would only take 20-30 minutes more to wait for the pizza.
