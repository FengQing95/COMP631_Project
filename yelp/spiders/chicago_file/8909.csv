Art Institute of Chicago////I have seen Monet's haystacks elsewhere but the post-impressionist collection is inspiring.  I want to go back to show my boyfriend the impressionist and romantic wings.  The contemporary photography exhibit was fabulous.  The miniature rooms were the best.  The museum volunteer there was kind enough to let curious visitors flip through the book about it to learn more.
