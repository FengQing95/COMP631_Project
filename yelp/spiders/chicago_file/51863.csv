Smoque BBQ////I had the sliced beef brisket sandwich.  The beef brisket had very little flavor.  It did have a small smoke ring around it, but the smoke flavor and rub never saturated the beef.  It also was fatty (fat makes me gag, so the 3-star rating, which should be 2.5.)  The BBQ sauce was thin and didn't have much flavor.  The meat was sliced thicker than I'm used to, but was very tender and falling apart.  I think the fat made it juicy.  So if you like fat, you may like it.
