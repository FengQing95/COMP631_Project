Smoque BBQ////The good - the mac and cheese.  I'm the pickiest person when it comes to mac and cheese to the point that I don't care for the way most restaurants make this childhood staple. Smoque's version ironically did me just right. The cole slaw was also nicely flavored and cut through the fattiness on the rest of my plate. The fries were a favorite of mine.  Thicker fries go well with BBQ and I was happy with what I received. On a side note... Smoque gets points for presentation as well if you are into taking pictures of your food. But I did like the music and the overall sloppiness left on my hands and face which makes me feel like I just had BBQ.
