Little Goat Diner////My most recent visit was this evening with an old college buddy and my roommate. We stopped in for dinner and I ordered the Fat Club sandwich. My buddy ordered the Sloppy Goat, and the roommate ordered the Los Drowned (braised beef and buttercase cheese among other deelish ingredients). He says it's basically their take on a french dipped sandwich.The sloppy goat was good according to my friend. He really like the cabernet he ordered. I liked my fat club sandwich but didn't love it like I loved my omelette and french toast. I think I should have gone with the Reuben. There was nothing wrong with my sandwich. Ingredients were beast mode and super abundant and fresh. Nothing about it wowed me except the size o the sandwich. I remembered the reuben had a really good flavor about it that stood out for me. The server was really nice. She got me a spoon for the coffee i ordered so promptly that she ninja'd it next to me and I hadn't noticed. When she came back to take our order I asked for the spoon for a second time and she pointed out that she had already placed it on the table for me. I had requested with such a snobby tone and she handled it like a pro and smiled. Kudos to her. I know I can be a brat sometimes. Overall service was stellar every time. Food was 9.5 out of 10 every time.
