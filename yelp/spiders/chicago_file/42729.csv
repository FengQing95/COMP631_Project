Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The Bad: It's a bit rushed on a weekend, so be prepared to make a reservation and stick to it! My second time at Babareeba, I was running really late and had to cancel my reservation and was told I could not reschedule it because it was a Friday. Luckily, we got a seat at the bar and still were able to have our full meal, but it was a bit loud there (but it's the bar/waiting area right next to where they announce who gets seated, so what else should I expect?).
