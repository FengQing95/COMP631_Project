Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I picked this new to me restaurant after growing up in Chicago based on recommendations from Yelp. It was even more incredible than I could have imagined. What a wonderful place. Eclectic surroundings, super friendly staff, incredible server and downstairs speak easy lounge...incredible night. Perfect for couples. I can't wait to come back!!!!
