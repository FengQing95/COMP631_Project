Little Goat Diner////Food is amazing!  I ordered Machos Nachos and the Los Drowned sandwich.  The Nachos were plentiful and fresh, the sandwich was to die for.  Service was great, we had reservations however arrived early and we were not waiting too long.  The place is very busy so definitely make reservations. I will be back for sure.
