Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They really load on the toppings, cheese, more cheese, and sauce.  The sauce is actually really tasty.  If you like cheese and sauce, you will love deep dish!  I am not a huge fan of the thick crust, but i did like the edge crust for its crispiness.  The thick crust does help to absorb all the flavor, sauce, and cheese, but you get filled up quick.  This pizza is hearty and requires the use of fork and knife to eat!  And large is was more than enough for 4 of us.
