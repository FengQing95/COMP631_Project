Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I agree with Jessica M completely - the thing that brings me back to Ba-Ba-Reeba is the food.  It is VERY tasty.  Best bacon-wrapped dates in the city and the beef tenderloin with blue cheese is to die for.  Also, order the goat cheese and if you're in a fowl mood, the chicken empenada.  Tasty-ness!
