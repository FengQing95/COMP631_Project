Little Goat Diner////Arrived around 4:45 for late lunch/early supper and there were only a few other tables seated and no line.  The calm was shortly lived, however  - families with small children started piling in first followed by the after work hipster crowd.   Our server was quick and friendly and our food was prepared in no time at all.  The meat and eggs are from reputable farmers, which considerably justifies the price point.
