Smoque BBQ////I ordered the sliced brisket sandwich with a side of beans, and my wife ordered a half pulled pork sandwich with a side of fries.  My sandwich was excellent - very well put together and the bread was hearty enough so it didn't break half way through (a big problem I've experienced is the bread to meat ratio is tilted towards the meat and the bread breaks, causing all sorts of fun).    My wife's pulled pork sandwich was excellent, and the side of fries was a LOT.  The fries did taste a bit like Five Guys, but probably because of how they were cut.
