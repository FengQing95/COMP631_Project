Little Goat Diner////Went to Little Goat Diner on a whim with my boyfriend this past Friday night and absolutely loved it!! We both have the same tastes, so we usually get two dishes and split them. This time we split the Bulls Eye French Toast and the Los Drowned "sammich" and loved them both!! I also got the caramel latte and could've probably had Â another one by the time I finished it. 10/10 would recommend this place to a friend!!
