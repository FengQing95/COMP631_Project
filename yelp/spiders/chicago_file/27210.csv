Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My friend described this pizza as a casserole. It's extremely thick with too much "stuffing", which in my opinion ruins the point of a pizza. It was a heavy dish in every way. The bottom became too soggy and droopy to be eaten without a fork and knife. I'm all for folding my pizza in half and eating it by hand, so this was a no no for me. But again, if it did and had all the things I liked then it wouldn't be a deep dish. For what it is, I think Lou Malnati's did it justice.
