Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The hot tapas were infinitely better. Meatballs in sherry tomato sauce, roasted dates with bacon in an apple vinagrette, not QUITE on par with the bacon-dates at HB, but probably a lot cheaper. Â The mushrooms stuffed with spinach and manchego cheese were alright as well. The mushrooms were nice and meaty, not squishy or rotten at all.
