Art Institute of Chicago////If you love museums, you MUST go here.  Location is perfect.  Right in the center of the city.  Walking distance from many places.  You can't possibly see everything here in one visit.  I would love to spend a few days here!  So much art work and all kinds.  I think the entry fee is reasonable because the place is huge and there is so much.  A must do when you are in Chicago.
