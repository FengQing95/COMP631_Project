The Purple Pig////I'm not one to normally wine and dine but the menu made it so easy to order a glass! They have recommendations for wine pairings with each dish and as someone who doesn't usually drink, I needed all the help I could get. The pairing was perfect. I surprisingly really liked the white wine paired with my octopus dish.
