Little Goat Diner////Beyond the food, our waiter was engaging, helpful, and patient despite the fact that it was a busy Sunday morning. These traits in a waiter are a serious rarity during Sunday brunch that should not be underrated. The decor was a wonderful throwback but modern diner feel that made me feel warm and fuzzy inside.
