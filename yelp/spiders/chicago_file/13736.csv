Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I could write a really long review outlining every fantastic thing about this place.  Or I could just simply say "Its freaking awesome".   I only had the plain cheese, but think that was a smart move because then i could taste the melted cheese and the incredibly well seasoned but not overpowering mozerella sauce.  The buttery deep dish crust is so much better than the corn based one at Genos.  I also had the bruschetta, which was great and i loved the fact that i could drink pitchers of Goose Island's 312.   The pizza was even fantastic the next day as an afternoon snack.  Overall, my new favorite Chicago Deep Dish pizza place.
