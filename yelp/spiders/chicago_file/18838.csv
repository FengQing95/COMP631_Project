Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Jose, our server, warned us that the pizzas take about 40 minutes to cook so we ordered the Malnati salad to hold us over until the pizzas were ready. It was the best salad ever! It comes with tomatoes, mushrooms, olives, salami, and cheese and tossed with their special dressing. I couldn't eat some of the things in the salad so they brought it out on the side and the salad was still delicious without the salami and cheese. We ordered two individual pizzas - the "Malnati Chicago Classic" with all sorts of meats and the "Lou" which is a vegetarian pizza. The Malnati classic was very good and flavorful and the crust was slightly crispy. The Lou was plainer and the crust was kind of soft. We liked the Malnati more. The individual pizzas are 6" so it doesn't look that big but it is very filling! We were celebrating a birthday so Jose brought us a complimentary slice of Chicago cheesecake from Eli's World. It was soo good.
