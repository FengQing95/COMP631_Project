Little Goat Diner////This is absolutely one of my favorite little dining spots in Chicago. The variety is outstanding and the creativity of the menu never fails to satisfy. One of my favorites is the goat sloppy joes - a nice alternative to the traditional, greasy ground beef version we all grew up with. Lots to choose from so it'll be hard to decide. Decor is fun and pleasant. Prices are affordable considering the quality and experience. Nice service, too.
