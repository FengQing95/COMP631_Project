Art Institute of Chicago////While I can say that I've been coming to the Art Institute since I was old enough to stand on the ledges in the Miniature Room and had the whole place memorized by 16 years of age, the layout can indeed be a little confusing for a newcomer. It's impossible to see the entire space without backtracking through a few exhibits at least once or twice.
