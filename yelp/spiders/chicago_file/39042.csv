Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I am so glad that they have outdoor seating now so that we can enjoy these summer nights.  The tables are set up on the sidewalk and sufficiently spaced and separated by little trees, so that it felt like your own private patio.  Food is as excellent as always, steaks perfectly cooked, delicious seafood and cocktails.  There is still also seating indoors if that's what you'd prefer!
