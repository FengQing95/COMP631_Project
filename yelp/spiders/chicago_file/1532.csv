Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Everything we ordered was amazing and had great presentation. From the Oreo s'more pancakes to the cinnamon roll pancakes to the los altos Benedict. There was a long wait but well worth it because it was great food with big portions at a fair price. Also helped that they had a waitlist program built into Yelp which also showed your spot in line.
