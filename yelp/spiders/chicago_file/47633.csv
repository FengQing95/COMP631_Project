Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ordered the meatballs, some paella, macaroni and cheese (with bacon!!), goat cheese and the short ribs.  Each and every dish was awesome in their own right.  Short rib was extremely tender, as were the meatballs.  Goat cheese was flavorful and came with a generous helping of garlic bread.  The sausage paella was nice and crispy (without being dry) and the egg on top was an added bonus.  However the mac and cheese with bacon was the standout.  The portion was quite large and the flavor was great.  Prices were incredibly affordable based on the food, considering the location, as well as the quality and quantity.  We left feeling full, but not stuffed ...which is perfect for any restaurant, in my opinion.
