Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Was disappointed by my experience here this weekend.  I have been here several times, and each time, I actually had a FANTASTIC experience, so I was quite disappointed at the poor service AND the mediocre food.  What happened Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba??  You went from one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago to one that I'm not sure I will come back to.
