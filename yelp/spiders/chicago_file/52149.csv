Smoque BBQ////I got the pulled-pork sandwich and my boyfriend got the beef brisket sandwich, which we split half and half. We got two cole slaws and BBQ baked beans and their brisket chili. Let me just say this..WOW! Their BBQ sauce was tangy and a bit watery but it was something I never had before. Definitely very flavorful. I used to not be a fan of beef brisket until I had theirs. It was definitely tender and nicely charred. The beans had this intense smokey flavor and the chili was sooooo good. I can't wait to go back for the ribs. Not to the mention the prices were just right too for such good food.
