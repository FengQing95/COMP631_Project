Little Goat Diner////i would definitely recommend trying the Crab Dip that comes with Ritz crackers, it's so cheesy and gooey and super fatty. just the way i like it. Also would recommend trying the cheesy french bread, especially since they make all of the bread in house. (bread is the reason they opened Little Goat all together after all) First time I went with the bf and tried the Supper Club Fried Chicken. The skin was fried to perfection and the chicken was super moist and tasty. The skin also had a hint of heat to it, like some hot sauce in the seasoning but it was delish.
