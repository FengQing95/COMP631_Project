Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The place was crowded(it was a friday late evening) We got a table soon though but four people shared a table for two !! Moving to the food exp here- Pizza took an hour to arrive and it was okay ! Mmm little less than okay actually . It was bland and had no salt. I mean that's important isnt it?
