Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I really used to love this place but the last couple of times I've been here I've been disappointed. I brought my Dad here last night and we sat at the bar because the hostess said it would be 45mins to an hour for a table for 2.. Whatever. Although we were a bit crammed at the bar we stayed optimistic as I scanned the menu and I ordered the blueberry cocktail. My dad got a glass of wine and he put in our first dish- Spiced lamb kabobs. Then I tried to order my all time favorite Sweet Potato Fries but they took them off the menu. Why??? :( So instead I got the spicy potatoes with dipping sauce- Def not as good. The last dish we got was the seared octopus and that was the only thing that was halfway decent. Probably won't be back for a while... Bummed out.
