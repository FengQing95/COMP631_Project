Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I had to try authentic deep dish pizza while in Chicago, so I came to Lou Malnati's. This place seems to be crazy busy, as I went twice and both times there were 45 minute waits to get a seat on a week night. I ended up ordering a pizza online for carryout, which worked well for me. I ordered a personal-sized deep dish pizza with sausage, green peppers, and fresh tomatoes. The pizza was amazing, so I'm glad I chose to try my first deep dish pizza here.
