Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////My one complaint with this place is seating. Since there were two of us, we were seated at the rear of the restaurant in the long line of tables. We were literally 12 inches for the people next to us. I don't generally have a problem with this since it's becoming the norm to maximize space and revenue, but we couldn't have a conversation because the people on both sides of us were having um, emphatic conversations. Like I said, I am used to this practice, but I guess being put into another couples' relationship drama at 9am on a Saturday rubbed me the wrong way. I ate half my food, and took the rest home. It was actually better warmed up as lunch.
