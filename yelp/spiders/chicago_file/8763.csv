Art Institute of Chicago////p.s.  Try to see it before the current special exhibit: Impressionism and Fashion, is finished.  You'll love it if you like clothes or impressionists even a tiny bit.  I appreciated how there wasn't an extra fee to see the special exhibits.  It might be worth it to get a membership if you live in the area, at least it would to me, I bet they offer some sweet perks or interesting events at least.
