Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////It's good. It's fine. It's Cafe Ba Ba Reeba, who lives in Chicago and has never been here? I think it's a place where ladies who live in Lincoln Park and just had their first kid go out with "the girls" or it's a place you take your parents or extended family when they come. But I don't know of anyone who comes here just because the food is so good. It's the experience. It's loud. It's super busy and crowded. It reminds me of a theme restaurant in Disney World.
