Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I followed the instructions for baking, had to cook it for an additional 10 minutes, probably because of altitude.  Ugh, it came out super soggy.  When I cut the pizza and started seeing moisture pooling in between the slices, I grabbed some paper towels to soak it up.  Still came out soggy when served.  Even the Old Chicago restaurants here in the west make better deep dish pizzas - sauce on bottom, then cheese, then toppings.  And no sogginess after baking.  I will never buy Lou Malnati's pizza again.
