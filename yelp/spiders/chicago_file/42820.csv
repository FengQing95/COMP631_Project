Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My favorite tapas joint in the city.  I like the outdoor seating in the summer.  In the colder months the hustle and bustle of the inside rooms add to the experience.  The sangria is a must and is very tasty.  As for what to get...its hard to say as almost everything is very good.  If you're having trouble, ask your server as they wont disappoint you.  I've probably been here 5 times.  Each time I try another tapas place, this place remains the leader.  Who will top Cafe baba reeba?  Only time will tell
