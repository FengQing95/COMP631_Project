Smoque BBQ////We've been meaning to try Smoque since it opened last year, and finally made the trek up to Pulaski. Maybe it's that my expectations were too high, after hearing such great reviews and seeing it on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. Maybe it's that I don't love barbecue sauce in general. Whatever it is, we left disappointed. I thought the macaroni and cheese and the fries were excellent. I loved the way the place was run - order at the counter, then see Barry to get seated. Everyone was super friendly - the woman in front of us in line talked us through what she thought were the best parts of the menu.
