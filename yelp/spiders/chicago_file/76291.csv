Little Goat Diner////Now for the Bullseye french toast. The description is "eggs, crispy chicken, sweet onion brioche, bbq maple syrup". I couldn't even imagine what that would taste like. It just doesn't make sense. But, once I combined all those flavors in single bites I was enlightened. So strange, but soooooo good. And wait for that hidden egg IN the french toast. Next level.
