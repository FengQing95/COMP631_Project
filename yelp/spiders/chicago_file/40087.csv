Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It's not easy to get reservations here.  If you're thinking "Let's swing by Bavette's this weekend"...think again.  I knew this spot was popular but didn't realize they get booked for up to a month or two in advance.  After searching OpenTable I learned just how popular this place is.  Our reservation was made a month in advance for 5pm on Sunday. Timing was perfect as it followed an early opera.  Doors open at 4:30 which is good to note because it was empty when we happened to arrive early and luckily, seated immediately.
