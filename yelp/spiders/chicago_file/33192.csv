Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This was easily the best meal I've ever had in Chicago. We went back in January for my birthday and 4 months later I'm still obsessing over it and wanting to go back. I loved the decor and how dark it was and seemed very romantic. The food was amazing. We had the goat cheese appetizer, steak & frites, filet mignon, and the brussels sprouts and buttery mashed potatoes for sides. Everything was delicious and the steak basically cut itself. I definitely recommend going if you haven't been!
