Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ordered different tapas. I loved the beef empanada, grilled steak, and garlic shrimp. Some were very salty like the squid. I didn't realize that it takes a long time for the paella to come, which was unfortunate because by the time it was out, I was full. I ate a little bit of it, but I found it really salty. I added lemons to mine and it was palatable after that. The acidity from the lemons muted that saltiness of the dish.
