Smoque BBQ////I picked up dinner the other day. I got the beef brisket which was just full of fat. The ribs were good, I would recommend ordering those. The pulled pork was very dry. I wouldn't recommend that. The corn bread was very good, and if you like smoky baked beans then you would like those. I was disappointed because I love smoked meats.
