Little Goat Diner////Chocolate Chip Crunch Pancakes: Yowza. SO. VERY. RICH. I have a huge sweet tooth but I could only eat 1 of the 3 pancakes that came with the order. The waitress asked if something was wrong, but there wasn't, other than this should probably be shared as a dessert rather than as a main.
