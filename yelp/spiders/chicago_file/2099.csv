Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Overrated. Food is decent, but definitely not worth the wait. The omelette was ok, but honestly didn't have a lot of flavor. The pancakes were better (the apple pecan ones are good), but nothing outstanding. Portions are decent but the food is pretty expensive. Service was about what you'd expect for such a busy place. I can't say I'm terribly disappointed, but it's definitely not worth the wait or the price. And even if there weren't a line, I wouldn't come back. Do yourself a favor and skip the tourist trap. This place is overhyped.
