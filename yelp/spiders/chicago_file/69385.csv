Little Goat Diner////snapshot: a very fun and trendy place that calls itself a diner, except that it's the coolest diner you will ever go to.  interesting and varied menu that's actually good.  you will wait to get in for *dinner* on a saturday night at a place that is known for brunch.  what does *that* tell you?
