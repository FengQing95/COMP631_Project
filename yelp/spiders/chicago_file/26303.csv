Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For the pizza we ordered The "Lou". The place is called LOU Malnati's so it just seemed appropriate since it was our first time. The pizza was the perfect ratio of cheese, tomato sauce, and toppings. We did order a small and share amongst three people and I was very stuffed after 1.5 slices. I would have ate more if I didn't eat before going to Lou Malnati's.
