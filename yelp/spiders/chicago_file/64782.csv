Smoque BBQ////I heard ton of friends raving about Smoque. I had to try it for myself. I knew this could be special once I seen the meat served with no BBQ sauce. St.Luis ribs where awesome, so was the chopped Brisket. The baked beans and coleslaw where nothing to write home about. I was however satisfied, as I went there for the meat and the meat was 5 .
