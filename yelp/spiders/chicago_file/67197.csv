Little Goat Diner////As a fiend of fried food, I was hard pressed to order anything on the menu other than the Bulls Eye French Toast.  Fried chicken...good.  French toast...good.  BBQ maple syrup...good.  Surprise eggs in the middle of said french toast...not quite what I was expecting (though, duh, bulls eye).  At any rate, I'm not a huge lover of eggs, so I was a little wah wah about the eggs.  They were very easy to pick around though, so it hardly ruined the dish for me.  The rest of it was awesome.  My sister ordered the tuna melt, which was slightly different from your average tuna melt - topped with a Nicoise style salad, but it was delish.  I snuck a few bites after she was full and could have snuck a few more if I wasn't so stuffed myself.  We got an order of the smoked fries to share and they were pretty good as well.  The first couple of fries had me thinking, hmm, how do they get the smokey flavor but after that they were just damn good.  Oh, and the bloodys, how could I forget those!  One of the better bloody mary's I've had.  Spicy, clean and refreshing.  Yes please, I'd like another.
