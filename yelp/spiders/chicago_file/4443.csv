The Purple Pig////Jimmy Bannos Jr and his staff of servers, hostesses and chefs absolutely SLAYED IT.  Every single person working here had a great upbeat attitude, although it was the kitchen whose stellar plate presentation and flawless execution of dishes left me stunned.  A legit dinner for two with drinks + tax + tip ran an even $200, but it was worth. every. penny.
