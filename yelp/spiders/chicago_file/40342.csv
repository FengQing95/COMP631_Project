Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Absolutely amazing. Oysters were fresh and delicious paired with cocktail sauce, hot sauce, lemon, and/or mignonette. We got to select from west or east coast and tried both. I prefer the west coast as they are much sweeter but east coast are bigger. Steaks were seared so well and the steak salt is a very good addition! My only criticisms are that the filet was slightly tough and the bernaise sauce was just alright. But the sides!!!! We got truffle Mac and their mashed potatoes that have garlic confit delicious jus on them and it was excellent. An indulgent meal but top notch service and fantastic food. Our waiter was kind and charismatic!
