Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Perhaps it's redundant to add yet another five-star review to a place that is just about universally agreed to be amazing, but I can't help myself! Bavette's has become a standout among all the great restaurants in Chicago, and is a great choice for a date or a celebratory family dinner. It's decorated like a 1920s speakeasy with low lighting, big comfy leather booths, mirrors, and eclectic tableware, and the resulting ambiance is really special.
