Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////They lose one star because our original reservation was for 7 people at 7:30.  We arrived promptly and were asked to wait.  We waited for 15 minutes, and by that point our 8th guest arrived-- I told the hostess that we would be 8, and after hemming and hawing, we had to wait another 15 minutes.  It made our 8th feel like a burden, which is never nice.
