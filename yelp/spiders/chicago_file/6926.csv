Art Institute of Chicago////Huge, beautiful, and free (on certain days that is).  It's a great place to visit and check out some pretty well known pieces of art.  There are so many different rooms to see and the architecture alone is a sight to see.  It's a wonderful way to spend an afternoon, alone or with a group of friends.  It's real close to Millenium Park, so if you're trying to check out everything in Chicago, stop in after checking out the Bean.  Tons of great photo opps inside.  If you really want to appreciate all the artwork inside you'll have to devote a good amount of time at the Art Institute.
