Smoque BBQ////A must go place in Chicago! We got the brisket, pulled pork, baby back ribs, cole slaw, baked beans, Texas sausage, peach cobbler and the mac n' cheese. They were all GREAT but the last two listed were the BEST! Don't miss out on the peach cobbler and the mac n' cheese. The place does get packed but we didn't have to wait long and the eating area was decent.
