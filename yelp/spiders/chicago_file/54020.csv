Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ive been here a dozen times. I'm not kidding. I like the happy hour tapas. Everyday from 4 to 6. I love this place so much, I got mild food poisoning once from the paella but I'm still coming back. Just staying away from the paella...their happy hour use to be all night Monday but the staff does seem to be confused about that...its not as authentic as cafe ibercho but I prefer this place.
