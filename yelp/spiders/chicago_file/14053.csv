Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Don't miss this if you're in Chicago.  As soon as it opened, I bought a whole pie and carried it on for my flight back to Austin.  No fewer than 10 Chicagoans commented on my carry on going through Ohare including the TSA woman who stopped the x-ray machine and called her supervisor over to announce I had to allow a sample to ensure it was safe to bring on board (there was no line)!   No, the TSA did not confiscate my pie, but we all had a good laugh.   This pizza is worth taking along as a carry on.  It's that good!
