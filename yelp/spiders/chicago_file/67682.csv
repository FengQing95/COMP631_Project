Little Goat Diner////We went to Little Goat on a Friday morning at 10am (we just missed the early bird b-fast specials). Parking was difficult; we drove around the block a few times before finally agreeing to valet our car. Valet is cheaper before 10:30am. We paid $10 and we were there for about an hour or so.
