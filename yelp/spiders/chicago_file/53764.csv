Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Sangria was amazing! My husband and I went on a random Tuesday and this place was packed! We ordered the shrimp (amazing!) Brussels sprout salad (very flavorful) lamb skewer (it was just ok) chicken empanada (very rich and delicious) and the hanger steak which I thought was cooked too much. We also got the paella but we only wanted to order 1 order of this due to ordering a lot of tapas but the minimum was 2 orders- which kind of sucks. The paella needed some spice to it but the Tabasco helped! We finally got the butterscotch custard for dessert and it was to diiiiie for!!! So delicious! Overall, I would come again but would skip out on the paella.
