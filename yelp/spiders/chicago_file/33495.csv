Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Been wanting to try this place for a while and was pleasantly surprised!  Went there on a first date and the high tops in the bar area were the perfect spot for that.  Goat cheese was great, cocktails were great!  Only downside was that the burger which looked great was over cooked and and fries were cold and soggy.  It was busy, that by the time I was able to get anyone's attention, I didn't even want hot fries.  I will probably be back to try it again next time I am in the mood for a steak!
