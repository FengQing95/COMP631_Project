Little Goat Diner////I had brunch here today, and it was phenomenal. I only dock the place a star because it was Sunday and things were crazy and service could have been a little better. I had the French toast with poached egg baked inside of it and fried chicken, all coated in BBQ maple syrup. It's so  indulgent I kind of wanted to get hosed down afterward.  Great atmosphere. Would be super fun with a group so you could share lots of plates.
