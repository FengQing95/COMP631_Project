Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I can't believe I haven't written a review of this place yet...I really don't know anyone who hasn't been here.  The atmosphere leaves a little to be desired, I guess, at times.  But the potato salad and the steak with garlic dipping sauce make up for it.  Both SO good.  And so are the stuffed mushrooms, the goat cheese, and everything else.  I have never eaten anything here that I did not like.  If you are one of the 5 people in the city that has never been here, you should definitely go.
