Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Anyway though, even if you have to eat at 5 when you're still full from lunch, or at 10, when you're falling asleep in your food, Bavette's is WORTH IT. I loved the dark, speak-easy ambiance. But most of all, I loved the food. We both ordered filet mignons - me the Petite Duchess, and him the standard 10 oz. Juicy, melt in your mouth, and perfectly cooked they were. For sides we ordered the frites and truffle mac n cheese. If you, like me, are also addicted to the fries served at Au Cheval, you're in luck because these are those same fries. Served crispy and salty with a side of garlic mayo, they were the perfect complement to my steak. The mac was also delicious although two sides was a bit too much to handle after you've gorged yourself on the incredible fresh baked sourdough bread they serve to start. And on top of it, an order of their fantastic bone marrow.
