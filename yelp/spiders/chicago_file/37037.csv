Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It was a Sunday, and I was riding up and down the El train doing silly tourist things.  This was day 4 in Chicago.  Throughout the many rides and visits to Chicago attractions that day, I witnessed a lot of people yelling aloud.  It was the first day the city had been anything but pleasant and fun.  I take the El to my late night dinner at this restaurant.  While switching trains, I see a man being arrested.  He is screaming loudly.  After I get off the second train, I see some shady deal going sour, and you guessed it, more loud public yelling.  Is Sunday the day all the crazies come out in Chi-town?
