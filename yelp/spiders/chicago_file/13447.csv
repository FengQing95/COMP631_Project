Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Just touched down in Chicago and was looking forward to a good deep dish. I had the Chicago classic which totally didn't hit the spot. The last time I was in town I had Gino's but based on the reviews and a recommendation from a woman on the plane decided to give this place a try. Needless to say I'm still craving a good deep dish!
