Little Goat Diner////I've been here twice for brunch and have had the taco salad and the veggie burger twice. The taco salad was a large portion size with good texture and flavor. The veggie burger was overly horseradish-y and the patty was crumbling all over the place. My nose was consistently running while eating the burger (you know that horseradish feeling). I do appreciate that they make the patty in-house. The burger also comes with no sides. The chickpea fritter always sounds so delish but alas, they cook it in the same oil as meat items, so I don't order it.
