Little Goat Diner////We ordered the Little Piggy Went to China and the Bulls Eye French Toast, and both were awesome.  Super flavorful, and a great size.  Probably could have combo-ed a side with these to split, but opted not to, so missed out on some delicious looking hashbrowns, but was happy not to be too stuffed on my way out!  Great spot, would definitely come back!
