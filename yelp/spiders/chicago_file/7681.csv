Art Institute of Chicago////Wow. When I visited the Museum of Modern Art in NYC in 2004, I was so blown away by their permanent collection - floor after floor of pieces I'd seen in many a publication. The Art Institute of Chicago is much like that, between the Impressionist galleries and the American Art alone. The difference is that the Art Institute feels more readily accessible.
