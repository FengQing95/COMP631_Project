Little Goat Diner////Came for dinner and decided to splurge ($19) for the Goat Almighty burger. What arrived was a 10" work of meaty art. I've never tried goat before, and I was impressed with the flavors from the goat patty. The beef and pork were incredibly tender and really meshed well together. The onion ring and pickled jalapenos were so good I wanted a side of them along with them on my burger!
