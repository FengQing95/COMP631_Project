Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is my favorite brunch spot in the city! It's my go to when I'm in the mood for a few things. Love trying a variety of dishes and it's easy to share when you're with a group. My favorites are the waffle battered chicken stick and the citrus French toast with goat cheese butter and honey!
