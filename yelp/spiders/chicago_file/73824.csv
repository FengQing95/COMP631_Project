Little Goat Diner////So two sandwiches (ala carte) and a shared appetizer of friend pickles, water and the bill split two ways was about $21 per person. I was fully aware going in that this is what it would be, but I hate to be that guy to say it might have been slightly overhyped and a little overpriced. Glad I went. I would go again, but it wouldn't be based on my suggestion.
