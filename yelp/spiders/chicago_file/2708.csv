The Purple Pig////What we tried: salt-roasted beets with whipped goat cheese & pistachio vinaigrette (oh good God, these were fantastic), chorizo stuffed olives (maybe the only "meat" we had. Good but I'm not super big on olives. If you like them you'll likely love this plate), a tuna salad which was more like an antipasti salad (olive oil tossed hunks of tuna with chunks of marinated veggies and quail eggs), salt cured greek yogurt with various accompanying spreads, and a delicious fried cheese (the kind I cannot remember but trust me--it was good). For dessert? We split the lemon panna cotta and the Sicilian Iris (ricotta & chocolate chip filled fried brioche--DANG). No regrets!
