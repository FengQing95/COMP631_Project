Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Next, the cons - at one point toward the end of our meal, a staff member who was moving chairs around slammed one into the back of my friend's chair. This gave her quite a jolt, and the staff member did not apologize or even seen to recognize what had happened. A minor issue, but still worth mentioning. The main talking point in this section is the food, I'm afraid. We ordered a large classic Lou Malnati's deep dish pizza, and it arrived only luke-warm. By the time we each had our second slice, the pie was cold. Even with the first slightly warm slice, though, I wasn't impressed. The dough was very greasy and the cheese was too tough, not the nice soft stringy texture I desired. The sauce was more of a diced-tomato topping, which was truthfully delicious on its own, but didn't seem cohesive with the rest of the dish and in fact easily slid off from the rest of the pizza, making it difficult to eat. There was far too much sausage for my liking (I think the entire pie was covered with a uniform layer), and again this caused everything to fall apart. The pizza was also extremely dense and left my stomach feeling a bit upset. Of course, much of what I've said is based on personal perference, and I completely respect those who prefer this over the manna from heaven that is served at Giordano's.
