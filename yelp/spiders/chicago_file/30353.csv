Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I came here alone, and I was told that they don't seat singles. So I decided to order take-out, which apparently takes THIRTY minutes. So I decided to walk around downtown and come back half an hour later, and lo and behold they went to the kitchen to "check on it." My thoughts? They want to remain exclusive so they tell me thirty minutes and make it in the ten minutes when I came back to ask about it. Not only that, the classic Lou's was... not good. It was like eating a very disappointing pie. There was a soggy bottom, and the cheese in a quarter of the pizza was quite enough for the ENTIRE pizza. Phew! What a waste of my time. I would recommend that you come here if you like deep dish pizza, but if you're from NYC or Italy just STAY AWAY!
