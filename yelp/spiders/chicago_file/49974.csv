Smoque BBQ////Some of the best barbeque I have ever had.  Easily my favorite brisket anywhere - super moist and smokey, wonderful flavor.  And the meaty side of beans are fantastic.  Smoque deserves any and all recognition it receives and should be on the short list for top 'que spots in the country.
