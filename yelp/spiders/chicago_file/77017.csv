Little Goat Diner////This place was so good, I loved being here. My group was coming from the airport and we just whimsically chose this place and made a reservation for the next available time slot they had (which was about 30 min out and it was like a 10 min walk for us). We arrived earlier than our reservation and they sat us immediately. They let us leave our luggage at the front so we wouldn't have to carry it around the restaurant.
