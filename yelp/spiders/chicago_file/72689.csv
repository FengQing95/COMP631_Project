Little Goat Diner////Fun, modern diner worth paying a visit to. I ordered the Everything Crumpets and they were amazing. Biscuits, spices, herbs -- everything was on point. Im not a fan of fish and missed that it had loz. I never mentioned so or complained, though without asking, my server generously offered to give me a substitute of ice cream or cake on my way out. I definitely recommend!
