Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Good food, HORRIBLE service. Our waitress, Gloria, stopped to see how we were after the appetizer arrived and never stopped again. After 45 minutes we finally flagged her down and she was defensive, rude and dismissive when we asked for some service. We would have loved some more wine, water and to try the desserts but were sick of waiting. Poorly played, Gloria.
