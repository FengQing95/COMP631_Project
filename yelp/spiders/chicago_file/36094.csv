Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////i always get the foie gras terrine with cognac and blackberries. its so delicious. the bread they serve it with is perfect. just so rich and noms.  salads are great and big enough to share. wedge salad is amazing. but the steaks. the steaks are so good. they're not the same as mastro's, which i also love love loveeeee, since they serve their steaks with sauce, but omg, cooked perfectly every time.  i usually share the bone in dry aged ribeye, medium rare, and it comes perfect to you on a hot plate.
