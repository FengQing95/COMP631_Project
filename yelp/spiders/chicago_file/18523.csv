Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were disappointed to taste this pizza which is supposed to be the best Chicago style pizza in town. We ordered personal pizzas and they were very bland.  Crust was boring, sauce tasted like it was out of a jar.  Toppings were nothing special.  The only good thing was the cheese. The cheese was delicious. Otherwise, would not recommend it and I can't see why so many like it. Maybe they all like bland pizza.
