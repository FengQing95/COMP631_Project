Art Institute of Chicago////Bisa Butler exhibit at the Art Institute is A-AMAZING!  I'm mean jaw dropping, exquisite tapestries on display. I snapped a few photos but really they do it a disservice. The level of detail in the facial expressions, the hands, the shoes, and clothing are astounding. The layers of fabric and interwoven history exude Excellence in artistry and pride of Black people.  And a Bonus for the Win - our hometown heroes the Obamas are on display. Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald are masterful capturing our forever first couple.
