Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When we finally got a table, we ordered fried calamari as an appetizer in addition to the pizza. Unfortunately it was all a disappointment.  The calamari was soggy and bland. Did not want to send it back to the kitchen because we all know what could happen when you send food back. I asked the waitress about the calamari and was told that next time I should ask for it to be well done. I never knew I had to ask for well done when it comes to fried food. I guess I know next time. She didn't even offer to replace it with a well done fried calamari since we barely touched the appetizer.  Oh well, we didn't want to push it further as we were waiting for the star of the show, PIZZA! BIGGEST disappointment!!! Our pizza was warm. Not hot!  The cheese wasn't even melted. When the waitress cut into it, the cheese wasn't even stringy. I was only able to take 2 bites. We absolutely hated it.  I then asked the waitress again if this was what the pizza was supposed to taste like. And she simply said "yes."
