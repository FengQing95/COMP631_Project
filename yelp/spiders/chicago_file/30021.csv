Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We went with the "Malnati Chicago Classic," small size (serves 2) for $14.95. FYI, a personal runs $9.45 and a large runs $24.95. The Malnati Chicago Classic is made with sausage, extra cheese, tomato sauce, and Buttercrust. While the pizza was good, it didn't seem exceptional to me. I was actually expecting there to be even more cheese (out to the edge of the deep-dish pan) and I was expecting the crust and cheese to be burnt in places. Instead, the crust had hardly any char whatsoever and tasted rather plain. The Buttercrust was noticeably richer than plain dough though. Admittedly, I think I was expecting more of a cheesy caramelized crust like those served at Pequod's. Overall, I thought the quality of the pizza and its ingredients were fine.
