Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went to cafe ba ba reeba to celebrate my promotion and may I say that I was very impressed by their service and the food!! The Tapas is really good!!!!!! A little on the pricey side but hey, its located in Lincoln Park, What do you expect? You get a good crowd, good food and excellent service- you can't really complain right?? Although I was nearly .... very.. shocked.. and a little buzzed after drink and looked at the check..I got over it quickly because I was very satisified about this restaurant.. I would definately go there again !!!
