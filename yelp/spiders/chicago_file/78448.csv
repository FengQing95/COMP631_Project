Little Goat Diner////I ordered the Piggy to China (17 dollars). The service, ambiance, creativity, and presentation of food were wonderful. I gave 1 star less just because the food was actually pretty salty. I feel like maybe adding something extra on the side to balance it out or put less salt. Overall would like to come back and try other dishes! The hash brown looked wonderful.
