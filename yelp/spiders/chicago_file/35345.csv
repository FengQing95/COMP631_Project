Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I can't say enough good things. My husband and I are visiting from Detroit and had tried to get reservations here a month ago without luck, so thought we were try showing up right at 5pm and were able to get a table. They sat us immediately at one of the cozy round booths by the bar. Our server, Brandon, was incredible- prompt and knowledgeable and had excellent recommendations. We started with the baked goat cheese appetizer- so good! My husband got the bone-in filet with bone marrow and a side of their truffle macaroni and cheese with bacon added (per our server's recommendation) and practically licked the plates. I had the short rib stroganoff and Brussels sprouts side. I am a huge short rib fan and theirs did not disappoint. The Brussels sprouts were cooked perfectly.
