The Purple Pig////Lamb Ribs - The family next to us, could not stop raving about this.  It did indeed look delicious so we ordered it.  WOW...thank you family that I don't know.  This was the correct choice and tied with the pork belly for most flavorful of the night.  This dish is a MUST when you come here.
