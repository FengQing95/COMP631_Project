Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We frequent this River North Lou's often.  This summer has seen the tap beer have problems.  Today, the Miller Lite was flat and they told me that there was a problem that they could not fix.  If this were the first instance, I could understand, but it happens oftern. The pizza is great and the bottled beer is ok.
