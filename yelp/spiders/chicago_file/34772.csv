Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I love Bavette's! It is my absolute favorite restaurant in this city! I have had their dry aged ribeye and seriously don't think I will even have a better steak in my life. The atmosphere is vibrant, undeniably cool, dimly lit and makes you feel you've done something right to simply be there! I prefer a table downstairs. It's a little quieter and feels a little more exclusive than the bustling atmosphere upstairs. That being said, take what you can get! It's a very popular spot.
