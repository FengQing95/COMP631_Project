Little Goat Diner////It is unlike a diner in the sense that the food is intensely flavorful and really really good, from start to finish.  The coffee is dark and strong, the cocktails are well-balanced, the fried pickles are briny and crunchy, the cinnamon bun isn't too sweet, the salad is packed with both vegetables and more decadent treats, and putting kimchi in a reuben sandwich was an inspired idea.  (Yes, we did get all six at once.  It was one of those days.)
