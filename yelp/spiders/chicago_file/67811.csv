Little Goat Diner////This place is decent for brunch and lunch.  I have to admit, I've not dined here for dinner or late night dining, so I can't say much about those time periods.  However, for breakfast and lunch this location is pretty amazing.  The menu selections are plentiful and everything we've ordered has been great tasting and well presented.  This place is slightly on the pricey side, but then again, pretty much every eating establishment on W .  Randolph St is kind of upscale.  Overall, I love the ambiance of the place.  It's kind of funny that there is now a sign which indicates where the restrooms are because when this location first opened, no one was able to find the restrooms since the wallpaper blended the door with the rest of the wall. : )
