Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////They do not disappoint.....staff at the door, bar, and the chef is amazing!  One of the most beautiful restaurants up and downstairs - actually downstairs can be better for conversation and by no means is any less fab than upstairs!  Seafood towers are worth every penny....the bread is to die for! If you are entertaining in the city and want somewhere special for a Chicago Steak at its best - this is the place to go.
