The Purple Pig////What is there not to love about purple pig? Amazing choice of dishes - every time I dine there I struggle to decide of what to try. Every time I visit chicago PP is on my list. Their new location is spacious but deep inside I missed their cozy small old place. I loved seating at the bar and watching their masterful chefs creating dishes right in front of you.
