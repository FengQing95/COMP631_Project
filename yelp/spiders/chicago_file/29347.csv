Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Food - my wife and I split the 2 person Chicago style Lou pizza and it was amazing.  We don't get a lot of authentic Chicago style pizza, so it was definitely memorable.  It was also plenty of food for 2 people, don't be tempted to get the 3 person serving unless you want to take a bunch home.
