Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Another recommendation we tried our luck after finding out it takes reservations weeks in advance. We were lucky there was a table available. It was beautiful restaurant we loved the ambiance the dim warm lighting and the exposed wall. The server was friendly and knowledgeable we ordered a chicago cut ribeye Â and the bone in one. The meat melted in our mouths it was excellent mine had the extra au poivre crust it was so good, perfect medium rare. The fries were good and their specialty side was the corn it was a bit spicy and tangy very delicious. Our bottle of wine was also excellent it was a chassagne-montrachet pinot noir it opened up really beautifully. The malt whiskey ice cream sundae was also really excellent using a good product (malt whiskey ice cream) really made a difference. We were so full but could not stop eating the sundae. We had a great meal here.
