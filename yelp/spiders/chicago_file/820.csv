Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Walked in freezing cold weather to try a local chicago favorite breakfast spot. Well worth it! Had Â a mexican omlet served in a skillet with hash browns on the bottom and then layered with eggs, advocado and HOT jalapenos! Also tried the pancakes: fluffy and delicious!
