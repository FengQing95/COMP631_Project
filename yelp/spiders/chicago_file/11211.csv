Art Institute of Chicago////One of the best museums on the planet, not the country, hemisphere, or continent, the planet. The AI holds it's own when compared to just about any institution, it is in the rare stratosphere of museums such as The Met, The National Gallery/Smithsonian, The Louvre, and The Prado. I've never been to any of the museums in Asia, but I'm certain it could hold it's own with those as well. The collection here is vast, the 2nd largest in the U.S., with only The Met having more objects. You could spend weeks here and never fully take in the vastness of the collection. I come on every trip I take to Chicago, often visiting multiple times per trip. And, on every one of those trips I experience something new. It's very much like The Met in that way, one could visit here once a week for a year and see something new to take in on every visit. Some major highlights: Of course Seurat's masterpiece, but get there early otherwise it will be swamped with tourists wanting to see "that painting from Ferris Bueller", Caillebotte's "Floorscrapers", The large scale Bonnard's and Vuillard's, the small but incredible Velazquez they have, the Goya etchings, the incredibly beautiful Courbet preparatory drawing, Soutine's landscape, all of the Giacometti's, Cezanne's "Portrait of madame Cezanne", Matisse's "Bathers", El Greco's "Ascension", De Kooning's "Excavation", and of course "Van Gogh's "Self Portrait". Notice anything from that list? It's all painting. That's my only complaint here, the museum is very painting heavy. In my opinion their best sculptures are in the India and Southeast Asian art wings, where there are many many gorgeous examples of Hindu and Buddhist sculptures. But, unlike some of the previous listed museums, the AI has a paltry Egyptian and Greek/Roman section. This is a very minor criticism, because the paintings they do have are incredible and worth many many visits. Beyond the collection, the building and it's numerous galleries are works of art unto themselves, everything here is beautiful. If you're in Chicago the AI cannot be missed. Set aside a day and spend some time communing with the beauty within it.
