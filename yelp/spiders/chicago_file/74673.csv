Little Goat Diner////The veggie burger was probably the best I've ever had. One kid had a burger with cheese, he liked it. The other kid had the fish tostadas. Huge portion. The only downfall was the long wait. And not sure what was going on with the hostesses, but quite a few parties ended up in front of us. Seems they need a better system for that. They had a lot of open seats, but surely the kitchen could've handled it. Worth the visit for the food and super cute atmosphere. While you're waiting, grab a drink in the bar.
