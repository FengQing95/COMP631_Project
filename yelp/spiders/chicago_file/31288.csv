Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered delivery to our hotel. Pizza arrived hot with a layer of plastic wrap on top to make sure the sauce wasn't splattered or crushed by the box. The sauce had great taste, great texture on the crust. It was a Chicago style dee dish but the crust was still very crunchy. And of course plenty of cheese. Only complaint would be that the crust itself didn't have much flavor, but overall very worth it. This was a medium cheese and was plenty for myself, my wife, and her grandmother.
