Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We really loved it! I'm from NYC so I was always apprehensive about deep dish pizza, but it did not disappoint. The mozzarella is thick and delicious and the sauce is awesome. Highly recommend this. I still like NY styled pizza better, but definitely delicious in its own way.
