Little Goat Diner////Went to Little Goat for a quick dinner, and it was good but not great. It's casual and quick, and the service was very fast. For food we got the This Little Piggy Went to China, which was the best with a unique take on a breakfast sandwich and I liked it a lot. We also got the Korean Chicken Tacos, which were okay, nothing that special. The Bloody Mary was the same, good but not amazing. Little Goat was good and the food was good, would get the This Little Piggy Went to China again, but there are better places in the area that are more unique.
