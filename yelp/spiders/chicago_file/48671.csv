Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Although this restaurant gets a high grade, i do not think it deserves it. First, the taste is just okay. I tried another Spanish restaurant in downtown before, actually that one is better than this and is less crowded. Also be carefully about the tip reference they give you!!!! I split my check with my friend but the tip reference was calculated on our whole order. We all gave the number on the reference without doubting the number!!! It was so disappointing to dinner there and I felt I was cheated. I would never go there again!!
