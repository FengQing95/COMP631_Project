The Purple Pig////One of my first meals on my trip to Chicago and it did not disappoint. The food was absolutely delicious and the service was great. Our server was very informative and attentive. The milk braised pork shoulder was easily one of the best dishes on my entire vacation. A must get. Along with the hamachi collar. The mixture of textures of the fried collar with the juicy meat inside along with the red onion relish made for a delicious bite. The bone marrow was solid and the broccoli was delicious. The environment is fun and vibrant with a mixture of people just getting off work, people on dates, and tourist stopping in for a bite and checking it out.
