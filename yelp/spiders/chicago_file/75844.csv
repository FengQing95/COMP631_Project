Little Goat Diner////I ordered 'This Little Piggy Went to China' and wasn't completely blown away but it did satisfy my breakfast craving. I really liked the sesame cheddar biscuit- it was buttery on the inside and had a great crisp/ crunchy shell. There was a sausage patty with two sunny side up eggs on top and it was topped with a chili garlic chive sauce. My problem with the dish was that there was too much sauce on it. It was a little bit overwhelming, to be honest. Otherwise I did enjoy my breakfast. I also had an americano for breakfast and it was a nice big cup but I didn't finish. The waitress was thoughtful enough to ask me if I wanted to take the rest to go. I thanked her and took the rest with me on my walk to the french market. Overall, I did enjoy my dish and would be willing to come back, however, I did think it was a bit expensive considering it wasn't the most unique in flavor or size.
