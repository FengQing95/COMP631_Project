Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute of Chicago...Even though I moved to Chicago two years ago, it was my first time going there. Yeah yeah, I know I know. In my defense, it always seemed too crowded with tourists whenever I was around. Anyway, the place is really great like countless others mentioned. They have hhhuuge collection on almost everything. But I especially liked the miniature interior designs of the past. The designs look so meticulous and intricate, I can't imagine how many hours spent building them. I easily spent almost 3 hours there, getting lost on time warp. I would recommend everyone to come here ready to spent at least 4 hours. I would recommend anyone coming here to get at least some information on the works displayed in museum because it would help greatly appreciate it. Again, AIOC is such a treasure of Chicago. Can't wait to get some free time and go back there to explore more awesome work of art.
