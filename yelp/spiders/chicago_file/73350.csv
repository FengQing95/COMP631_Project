Little Goat Diner////My family and I were in Chicago for a week to celebrate our daughters 9th birthday. We had eaten at Boka the night before we visited LGD, and I must say that our experience at the diner was just fantastic and such a welcome, and honest surprise. We are from Detroit/GP and don't have a shortage of restaurants presently, but nothing that matches , in my opinion the exactitude of simplistic perfection as this place does.
