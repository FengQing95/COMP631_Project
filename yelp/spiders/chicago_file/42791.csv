Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I was satisfied overall with the food, but certainly not blown away.  The stuffed mushrooms were amazing, but everything else kind of meandered around average.  The biggest disappointment for me was the pacing of the meal.  I realize that tapas just comes out as it is ready, but we had almost our entire order come out within just a few minutes of one another.  We blinked, and the meal was over.  If I go back, I would definately hold back my ordering so that I could have a little more control over the pace of the meal.  If 3.5 stars were an option, that would probably fit this place perfectly.
