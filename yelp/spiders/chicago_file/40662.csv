Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Have never had tapas before but I liked it.  I had to keep an open mind going in because it was going to be something different. Loved the mango sangria, and we ordered about 7-8 different plates and they were all good.  The waiter was great and after finding out that my daughter suggested going there while we visited form Michigan, he bought us 4 desserts. I would definitely want to go again the next time we're in chicago.
