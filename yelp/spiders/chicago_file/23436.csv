Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When Lou Malnati's was recommended by local friends, we had to go. Our waiter, Collin was very attentive and recommended everything we ordered. It sooo delicious! I definitely recommend the spinach artichoke bread and any deep dish pizza. It will not disappoint!! Also, high praises to our server. Collin was awesome and we really appreciated him.
