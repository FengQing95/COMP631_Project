Smoque BBQ////The first time I went to smoque I ordered a pulled pork sandwhich and the owner gave me free brisket also to try and mac n cheese. The second time I didnt have enough money for what I wanted (forgot most my money at home...opps) but they gave it to me anyway! Its such a friendly and warm enviroment that is so welcoming I would recommend this place to anyone!!! try it out!!! :)
