The Purple Pig////So glad we came! Heriberto took good care of us. He was very attentive, he had great suggestions for food and desserts, and he one when to bring stuff out since we ordered around 11 plates or so. We were really happy he took the time to chat with us, despite it being super busy on a Friday night.
