Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////On our most recent trip to Chicago (in December) Lou Malnati's was on our list of places to dine. Our first trip to this particular location was on a cold and snowy Chicago night. It so happened that the power was out so there were no pizzas being cooked that night. Before we left Chicago we stopped by Lou Malnati's and picked up one large deep dish combo pizza and one large sausage and cheese thin crust pizza.
