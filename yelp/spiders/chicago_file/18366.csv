Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was an overall unfortunate experience (but the rest of Chicago has been quite enjoyable to check out)! First, I was told there would be a 35 minute wait. Over an hour later, and after witnessing multiple parties of two who had been seated before me but had arrived after me, I approached the hostess and was told that I was next for a 2-top (I was dining alone). Why were the parties of 2 who arrived after me seated before me?!? At that point, I still thought it would be worth it. Then I received my pizza and wished I'd ordered room service at my hotel instead. It was warm, but not enough for the cheese to stretch at all. Table service left much to be desired. What a disappointment!
