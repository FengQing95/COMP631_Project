Au Cheval////For the last 5 weeks, my roommate and I have been on a quest to find Chicago's best burger.  Au Cheval was our first stop, and while I am not prepared to declare the search over, I have concluded that Au Cheval is my favorite so far.  I had the burger medium rare with whichever toppings the kitchen puts on by default, plus the optional bacon and fried egg.  The very first bite immediately transported me to burger heaven.  The cheese is a somewhat sharp cheddar if memory serves, perfectly melted and full of incredible flavor.  The bacon is cut so thickly that it is practically a ham steak, and it too was delicious.  I had never had a fried egg on a burger before, but I sure am glad that I did this time.  All of the ingredients complemented each other perfectly and, in combination with the obvious care put into preparation and presentation, made for a symphony of flavor that I will not soon forget.  I'm trying not to revisit any of the places on my journey until I feel the quest is complete, but in the case of Au Cheval, I may not be able to resist making an exception.  Do yourself a favor and eat here soon.
