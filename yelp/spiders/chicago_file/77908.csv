Little Goat Diner////Visiting this place is such a fantastic thing to do, especially when you are looking for beautiful space where you can spend your time with your friend or family. Everything here at Little Goat Diner was so fantastic, their employees was very patient, kind, informative, and friendly. Their waiters literally know how to explain each of every food at their menu, and they even suggest some dishes to their customers. Some of their craziest dishes on the menu surprisingly fall flat compared to the simpler dishes, they also have okonomiyaki which is so popular to many people, and it was so tasty and incredible. Their place is so nice, clean, and you can feel the great atmosphere they have in their place. It is so comfortable spending time there, friendly employees, great vibe, incredible food, overall was so amazing. I am so glad that I have experience their great place, will definitely go back again soon and explore their menu, will also recommend and introduce this Little Goat Diner to all the people I know, for them to also experience all the things I have experience when I came there. Thank you guys! Keep up the good work! See you soon. Kudos!
