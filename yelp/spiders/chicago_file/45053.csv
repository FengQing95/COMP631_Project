Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food was great. There wasn't too much of a variety though. For $18 a person, it was kind of disappointing. It would suggest going if you want to see what all the hype is about, but there are certainly better restaurants in Chicago you could be going to for a better experience.
