Little Goat Diner////This is my first yelp review and I am writing this because I was simply disappointed with the experience I received tonight.  I should first say that I was most excited to dine at Girl and the Goat, but when I arrived, they were closed due to a private party.  I thought that this would be a great opportunity to give Little Goat a try.  When I arrived, the host team was friendly and inviting.  I was quickly seated and upon looking over the menu, I felt a bit overwhelmed.  I was confused as to which part of the menu I should start at.  I thought it would be a good idea to choose something to get the experience started.  When the server finally greeted the table, my guest ordered a diet beverage.  When she returned, a while later, I opted to order the Chopped Salad and the Mac & Cheese.   When the Mac & Cheese arrived, it was anything but hot.   When the Chopped Salad arrived, it was buried beneath a mound of shallots.  As I continued on with the salad, I had discovered more onions.  This time they were pickled, which is fine.  I enjoy pickled onions.   Moments later, I ordered 2 Sammiches.  The first was the BBQ Pork.  The second was the Korean Burger.  I took a bite of the Korean Burger and I thought it was mediocre, at that.  I then jumped over to the other side of my plate and took a bite of the BBQ Pork.  I savored the bite for a moment and then I realized a very familiar taste.  I opened up the sandwich and to my dismay, there were more onions.  This coming from an onion lover, I thought this was TOO MUCH.  I moved them aside and attempted to finish my dinner.  I wasn't as satisfied as I thought I would be.  It didn't help my experience that I had to ask 3 of the 4 times for refills for my diet soda.  When the support staff came to fill my water, he asked me how my dinner was.  I told them the truth.  I replied, "it's just okay."  As I finished my dinner, a manager approached the table.  He wanted to find out where I was in my experience and offered to send something out that I would enjoy.  I turned down the gesture and wanted to just wrap up this experience.   At the very end, the server offered me dessert.  I had room for dessert and would have stayed, but I thought it would be best enjoyed at home.  Upon paying the bill, I had a Girl and the Goat gift card that I had wanted to use.  She came back only to notify me that they DO NOT accept this card.  It would have to be used across the street, is what she said.  As I signed the credit card slip, I looked to the bottom of the receipt.  It simply stated...Thanks.  Come again.  I wondered to myself, Would I??
