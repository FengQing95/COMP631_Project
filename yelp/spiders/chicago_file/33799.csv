Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As soon as we walked in, it felt like going back into the prohibition era (and I mean that in the best way possible). It was laid back and classic...in a dark and beautiful mysterious way. They played jazz throughout the evening, which played a prefect part to the relaxing mood atmosphere. My boyfriend and I came here for our one year anniversary. And have to say such a great choice. To start, we had the crab cakes with a savory aioli. I had the 10oz filet mignon with a side of a baked sweet potato. My meal was absolutely delish!! My BF had the 16oz bone in filet mignon with a side of Mac n cheese. I took a few bites of his mac and mmmmmmm yummy. We shared a Chicago-style cheesecake and topped that off with a cup of cappuccino. It was an amazing and great experience! We cannot wait to go back!!
