Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Had an amazing 3 year anniversary dinner here a couple of weeks ago. Made a reservation in advance- you will definitely need one! Interior is dark, cozy and very 1920s themed. Our server was phenomenal. Very attentive, quick and helpful. To start, we had the king crab platter (worth the $$), and the mixed greens and apple salad. We then split the bone in ribeye, truffle Mac and cheese, and the Brussels sprouts. Everything was so good! Ribeye was cool perfectly. Lots of flavor! For dessert we did the chocolate cream pie. Definitely a must!! It was more like a ganache- very rich!!
