Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I don't understand the appeal of Lou Malnati's pizza. The crust is blah at best, the sauce just so-so. It's something that I've been served at corporate events a number of times and always come away wondering why they didn't get one of a number of other local chains instead. This definitely isn't my style of pizza.
