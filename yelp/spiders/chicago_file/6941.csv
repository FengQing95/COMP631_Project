Art Institute of Chicago////I can't cover everything they had at the art institute, but they had a surprising gathering of paintings from artists like Monet, Manet, O'Keefe, Picasso, Van Gogh, Kandinsky, Dali, Miro, Renoir, Gauguin... and that's about where my art knowledge runs out. They have the famous Seurat Sunday on La Grande Jatte, Nighthawks by Hopper, American Gothic by Grant Wood. There were so may other artists with interesting work, I could have easily spent another 3-4 hours wandering through the halls.
