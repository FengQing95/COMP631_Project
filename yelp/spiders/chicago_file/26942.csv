Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As soon as we were seated, the kind waitress confirmed our pizza. It took another hour for the pizza to arrive. What was the point in me ordering earlier only to have to wait another hour for our meal to come out? We ordered the "The Malnati Chicago Classic" and it was... okay. It was layered of crust, sauce, sausage patty, cheese, and tomatoes. We asked for garlic as an additional add-on. I think if I had not asked for garlic, the experience would not have been "A-OK" per Yelp standards.
