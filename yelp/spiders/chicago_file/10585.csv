Art Institute of Chicago////My first time here, I spent all day exploring the various Impressionist collections.  But on the way out, I realized I had not seen nearly 30% of the remaining rooms.  One room in particular caught my attention.  It was a massive room containing ancient sculptures and relics... what shocked me was just how cluttered the room looked, there were so many art works, all of them incredible and beautiful, yet lost in the clutter.  Such is the size and encyclopedic nature of this museums extensive collections.  Yes, the Art Institue provides a great way to spend a nice afternoon, but you will certainly need more than one afternoon if you want to see everything!
