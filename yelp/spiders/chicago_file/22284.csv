Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I am a fan. THERE IS SO MUCH CHEESE. This little baby may look small but it sinks like a savory rock in you tummy. Get ready to eat. I like this place because they are fairly quick and it is NOT oily. A lot of other places manipulate their flavor into "good" because they put a Sh*t ton of butter and oil on the food. Nope, not here. just sauce, cheese, and a crispy and soft crust. I may not go again because i personally dont like pizza as much as i should. however. it was pretty good.
