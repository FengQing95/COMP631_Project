Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've always absolutely loved this place, and my most recent experience even further amplified my adoration for it. They gave us free gift cards, merchandise, AND covered our entire meal after one of their waitresses accidentally spilled a drink on one of my friends. It was a complete and total accident, and nobody was upset, but they made sure to do anything they could to mitigate discomfort on our end. I would've recommend this place to anyone prior to this incident, but this just confirmed how great it is. Best customer service ever!
