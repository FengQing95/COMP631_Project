Smoque BBQ////The food here is great! I have had the chopped brisket sandwich, the pulled pork sandwich, and, of course, the baby back ribs. All of the meat is super tender. I had the ribs to-go, but they still had the smokey smell when opening the box! The BBQ beans, fries, and cornbread are all really good too. The cornbread has corn kernels inside. The cole slaw is a bit vinegar heavy, but I still eat it.
