Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Other Yelpers said service was not Bavette's strong point, so I was a little worried because I do really value good service. But contrary to those reviews, as soon as we walked through the door (7:00 reservation on a Sunday), everyone was super friendly, from the hostesses and our waiter, to the food runners and the busers. So either Bavette's management read those negative reviews and did something about it.. or we just got really lucky!
