Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////first time at deep dish... was delish, but i m not sure i want another one in a long time because it was heavy and quite filling... if your new to chicago and want to have the deep dish experience, you must go check this place out and make your own interpretation... place gets super busy by the way; we went at an awkward time between lunch and dinner and didnt have to wait..
