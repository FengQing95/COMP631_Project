The Purple Pig////I ordered the potato salad, grilled broccoli, chicken thighs, and corn bread. First, my group was seated at the community table. The hostess total me I could only sit in the seat She wanted me to sit in. (Girl please!) I had to speak to someone else to seat where I felt most comfortable at the community table while making it easy to seat other guests. Other than the hostess chick service was great.
