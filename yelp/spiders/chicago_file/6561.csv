The Purple Pig////They are located right on the Magnificent Mile and beloved by locals and visitors. When I dined here about a decade ago, they were in a different building just next door which has turned into a Chick Fil-A. Â Now the food is even better than I remember. It's definitely a spot that can be for a special occasion and the food will be a bit pricier, but well worth it. I'd add the Purple Pig to anyone's "must try" while in the city.
