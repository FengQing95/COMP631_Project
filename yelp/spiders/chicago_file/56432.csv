Smoque BBQ////Service, by the way, turned out to be an unexpected surprise. When I was undecided between St. Louis and Baby Back Ribs, the unassuming mustachioed manager on the floor guided me to the former. And when the counter girl rang us out without beverages after mistakenly telling me they didn't have diet fountain drinks -- before I noticed that the fountain machine had Diet Coke clearly labeled -- Mustache Guy quickly gave me two cups.
