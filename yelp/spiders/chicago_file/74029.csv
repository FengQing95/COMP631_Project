Little Goat Diner////This has always been a favorite of mine. While the staff can be a bit distracted from the constant onslaught of hungry patrons, they try their best to accommodate during dinner time rush. Nonetheless, even with a reservation booked, we spent 20 minutes in their wait area before securing a nice window booth near the front. I imagine if you're okay with family style seating, you would find a seat sooner as a small party of 2-3. Despite the wait, we really enjoyed the food. Amongst the four of us, we divided 4 different offerings: the bang mi burger, the kimchi burger, the tonkatsu sandwich, and the traditional Chicago-style dipped fare (the most popular dish that I've unfortunately forgotten but I'm sure s waiter can recommend.) of all our entrees, the tonkatsu option was definitely the most generous, looking like a giant stack of two sandwiches. I also highly recommend the milk stout shake. Be adventurous! Apart from a mix-up with receipts, the rest of our experience was lovely.
