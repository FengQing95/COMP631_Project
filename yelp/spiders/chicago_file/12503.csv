Art Institute of Chicago////I appreciate all forms of art. I enjoy documentaries and books about all history. So, naturally The Art Institute of Chicago was on my museum bucket list! I wasn't disappointed, I spent three hours being fascinated about every single exhibit and painting. This place in AMAZING!
