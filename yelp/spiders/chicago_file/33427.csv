Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////3. The wait staff was mediocre. Â As we said above, they didn't check in with us, didn't offer us bread, didn't set the utensils (they just threw them in the middle of where we were sitting) and when we were given the bacon that came with pepper, didn't point out the pepper until we'd eaten the entire dish (they'd placed the pepper off to the side). Not exactly rude, but not professional by any means.
