Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is a pretty good place for groups (as long as you have a reservation). I went there a couple of weeks ago with some friends and we had a good experience. When we arrived, we were seated quickly because we had a reservation, and overheard other people coming in around the same time being told that there was a 3-hour wait!
