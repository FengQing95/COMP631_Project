Little Goat Diner////Decor is nice and good setup however, service and food  are not up to standard for a menu that is  ala carte  and for the prices ($10-$13 breakfast items, hash-browns $4). Ordered Brandade  Belly Benedict and hash-brown with grumpy goat cheese, Brandade was flavorless, biscuit  greasy (actually swimming in oil) and  2 small pieces of pork belly . The hash-browns  were greasy with a burnt flavor.  Coffee was good .
