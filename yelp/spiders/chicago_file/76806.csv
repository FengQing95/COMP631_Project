Little Goat Diner////Stopped by for breakfast on a Wednesday but made a reservation on open table just in case there was a wait. When we arrived it was busy but still plenty of seating. The hostess stand however was not doing a great job of managing things. I waited behind one other person but a group of 3 got in front of us both and the host seated them first anyways. After taking his sweet time seating them while not addressing either of us he turns to me first but I kindly let him know the girl next to me arrived before us. The restaurant was not really busy yet we were greeted (or not greeted) by a semi frazzled and not too friendly face. But my ranting aside, the food was good and the decor felt fresh yet comfortable.
