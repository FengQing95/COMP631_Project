Little Goat Diner////My sister and I made it our mission to try Little Goat for brunch.  First of all, who doesn't like the cute little goat spinning on top of the building?  Don't let me catch you saying no.  It's adorable!  Second, I am not lying when I tell you this place gets packed.  My sister and I waited about 45 mins to an hour for a table.  Don't fret people, just leave your number and they will text you when your table is ready.  Go ahead, wait next door and have a cup of coffee.
