The Purple Pig////I don't really know what the hype about this place is. My friends and I came for lunch and had to wait in a ridiculously long line, so my expectations were really high. I like how they do family style here and bring out the dishes as they're made ready. The food itself was super salty in my opinion. We tried dishes fellow yelpers recommended, but none of the dishes met my expectations. Our bill was well over $100, but none of us were full and content.
