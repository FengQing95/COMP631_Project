Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My hotel recommended their competitor, but yelp steered me to Lou's.  We ended up going to the competitor the next day, and it felt like going to a Ruby Tuesdays by comparison.  It felt like a tourist trap, whereas Lou's felt like the real thing.  It also tasted much better.
