Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My boyfriend and I had the best time here. We went to celebrate for his birthday and heard so many great reviews about this place that we had to come check it out ourselves. I definitely recommend making reservations as they get booked pretty quickly. I made a reservation for us to sit in the parlor. Which is a nice intimate atmosphere downstairs. We end up ordering sizzling shrimp scampi for an appetizer. It was amazing. For the main course we ordered honey glazed salmon and dry aged bone-in ribeye. For our sides, we ordered buttery mashed potatoes and elote style corn dip. Everything complimented everything well. I absolutely loved the elote style corn dip. I almost ordered another to go lol but was so full. A fun fact, if you love au chapel burger you can also get it here since its the same restaurant group. I would have to say this is one of my favorite steakhouse thus far !
