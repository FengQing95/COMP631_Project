Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Part two, the food runner that brought our food to the table spilled my drink all over me. Accidents happen so that is not the issue. The issue is the spill was left on the floor until we were finished eating. The server, Samantha, even came back to the table and didn't say a word or get it cleaned up. The guy at the opposite table slipped. Then the buser came to clear the table and looked at me like, how did I make such a mess. Final straw, they didn't even remove the drink from the bill that was dumped all over me. Horrible,horrible, horrible, customer service with mediocre deep dish pizza.
