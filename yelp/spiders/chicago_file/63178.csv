Smoque BBQ////They have a couple of sauces, and here comes a complaint: one is called a Memphis style sauce (thick , fairly sweet tomato), the other a Carolina sauce which means there's vinegar involved.  They decide which you'd prefer based on your order; you wouldn't use the Carolina red with chicken... but what they don't do is let you decide how much of either you want to use.  They put a shot on your order and a little plastic cup with what they think goes well, and you've got to go back and ask (and ask again if you want more) for any extra.   Why not put two containers on each table and let folks serve themselves?  It's got to be cheaper than buying thousands of those little plastic gizmos, and there'd be fewer people trying to get back to the counter.
