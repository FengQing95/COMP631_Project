Smoque BBQ////Overall though... it wasn't anything we'd rave about and probably wouldn't go out of our way to revisit Smoque if we were in town again.  For us, we don't know how Smoque has such raving yelp reviews.  Maybe it's really good BBQ for Chicago... but I know for my bf, he's had the best BBQ ribs at Phil's in San Diego, CA and Dinosaur in NYC.  But Smoque in Chicago just didn't seem to compare.
