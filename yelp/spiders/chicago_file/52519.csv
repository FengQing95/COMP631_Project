Smoque BBQ////This place is so good, I've had the brisket sandwich before but wanted something healthier when I went there today. Instead, I got the small salad (which was huge) with chicken in it. It was really good, and had lots of chicken, sunflower seeds, sun dried tomato, and cucumber. I got BBQ sauce for the chicken and used a teeny bit of the ranch, and it was perfect! I had to hold myself back from ordering cornbread, it's probably awesome though. I've had the mac n' cheese before, and it's really good as well. They were super quick and everyone was smiling and friendly.
