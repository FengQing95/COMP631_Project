Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The buttery crust is a fan favorite and deservedly so, but what makes Lou's so delicious is it's minimalism, a paradoxical assessment of deep dish pizza.  They limit your pizza toppings and it's the right direction.  Savor the quality ingredients instead of sensory overload of too much cheese (Giordanos) or overwrought tomato sauce (Pizzeria Uno).
