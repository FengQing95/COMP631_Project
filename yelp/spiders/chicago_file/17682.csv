Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was personally my favorite pizza in Chicago so far. The Classic deep dish size small was good for two people. The sausage was delicious and the cheese could be pulled about 1- 1 and-1/2 feet! Why three stars? This was the worst Customer Service I have ever seen in all 50 states. They were the rudest staff. I heard them audibly talking rude judgmental comments about a group that just walked in. They were short were their answers and unapproachable. We ordered carryout and they said 30 minutes which is totally understandable, it has to cook. We waited for an hour and a half and my wife kindly asked them if it was done. They lady said "if it was done you'd have it in your hands now please wait over there" in a sassy tone. My wife was surprised this place was still in business with how rude the staff was. After an hour and a half we got our pizza and it was cold like it had been sitting for awhile. If we visit another Lou Malnati's, we will visit a different location.
