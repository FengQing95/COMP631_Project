Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our appetizer was a shrimp and bread dish (I'm blanking on the name) that was very flavorful and was an excellent starter to a much larger meal. I ordered the dry-age NY Strip cooked Medium-rare and it came out perfectly cooked with our accompanying sides of fries and Mac and cheese.
