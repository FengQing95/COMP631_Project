Little Goat Diner////It was worth the wait.  Too much to choose from on a fun menu (Cereal Killer, Sammiches, Simple/Healthy/Hungry Goat).  Kids both had the grilled cheese/fries off the kids menu, I had the shrimp and grits, he had the Bandade Belly Benedict.  We also ordered two sides of Gunthrop Farm bacon...cuz we like bacon.  It was a lot of food - and we ate all the bacon because it was thick and crispy.  Martinelli apple juice (kids), cream soda (him), coffee black (me).  The coffee was dark and robust.  I usually take sugar sub and milk w/my coffee, but the rich flavor of the coffee was good on its own.
