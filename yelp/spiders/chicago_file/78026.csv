Little Goat Diner////Having fallen in love with okonomiyaki in Japan, I was pleasantly surprised by how well Little Goat delivers this lesser-known Japanese dish that's basically a savory pancake of cabbage, flour, and egg - mixed with a generous amount of mayo and sauce. I wish there was more cabbage to give it some crunch, but I like that it wasn't too-heavily sauced.
