Little Goat Diner////Fried Chicken: My favorite item, even if it was a bit salty, served on a bed of delicious mashed potatoes. The chicken is cooked perfectly and the skin is just the right amount of crunch without an excess of oil dripping from it like you'll get at less competent establishments. Even the slaw they serve with it is good.
