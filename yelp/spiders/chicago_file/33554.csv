Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband and I went here for dinner and felt like it was slightly overrated. We had the goat cheese appetizer (pretty good) both got a salad- mistake they were huge! We tried the crab avocado which was really good and the trout caear which was also pretty good. For an entree we shared the bone in dry-aged ribeye which for $65 wasn't spectacular. It was pretty fatty even for a ribeye, and the bernaise sauce was just okay. We had the corn and pomme frite sides which were also just okay. We wished we would've skipped the Caesar, ribeye and sides and gotten crab. Chocolate pie dessert was good, service and atmosphere great- but for steak we would go somewhere else for the price.
