Little Goat Diner////Caution: this place gets packed quickly, especially after a Blackhawks game (we found out after we were seated and a swarm of hawks fans dressed in post-game attire).  We were were taken care of immediately, and our waitress was extremely kind.  I proceeded to order the smoked pork and toffee milkshake.  Imagine a salted caramel milkshake with the bacon-y smokiness and fatty taste, it was unbelievably delicious.  For dinner, I ordered the sloppy joe, something I never eat, but it was goat meat, with a Rosemary slaw and pumpkin bun, I had to try it.  Even though my last sloppy joe was eaten during a 5th grade camping trip and blocked out the experience of eating that, I really enjoyed the Goat Sloppy Joe.  The flavor was not too overwhelming, and the veggies were fresh and added a nice contrast to the spiced decadent goat.  The pumpkin bread was very subtle and was an interesting combination instead of just using regular bread.  I am glad to say I tried a pork milkshake and a goat sloppy joe, and I would like to come back here to try the other delicious food they have to offer.
