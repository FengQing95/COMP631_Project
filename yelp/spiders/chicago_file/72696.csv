Little Goat Diner////I thought it was JUST a diner. I thought it was irrelevant to Girl & the Goat (the menu is completely different and it is essentially a diner), but this place did not disappoint. It borrows great food concepts from it's sister restaurant, but with a diner-twist. This is not your average plate of pancakes and bacon.
