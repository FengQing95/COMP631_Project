Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's blew us out of the water tonight!  There was not a single thing we did not enjoy, between the ambiance and the food, everything was perfect. The BYO policy is awesome, bring your own bottle but you need to share a glass with a table around you, no problem, enjoy!  We started with east coast oysters, then had the baked goat cheese which came out piping hot with the best seasoned Texas toast ever!  I had the filet mignon and my hubs had the pork chop, my steak was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. The potatoes and corn paired perfectly with our meal. The whiskey ice cream with fudge was to die for!  There's a cute basement lounge you can enjoy as well. Benjamin rocked as our server, thanks for your recommendations and advice.  Amazing, can't wait to come back!!
