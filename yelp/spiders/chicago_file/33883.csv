Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I got the 42 day dry aged ribeye cooked medium rare, and honestly, it was one of the worst "nice" steaks I've eaten. It came out pretty much rare and I knew if they put it back on, all the flavor and juice would be lost. It was super dark in the basement and the service was far from exceptional. It was overall, an average steakhouse in my opinion.
