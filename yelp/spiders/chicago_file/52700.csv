Smoque BBQ////Smoque BBQ was a random find for me. Nobody told me about it, and I didn't find it on urbanspoon or yelp. To be honest, I can't remember how I stumbled upon their website. Anyways, regardless of however I found this spot- there was no way I was going to pass up on a BBQ place. It was a few minute drive from Chicago downtown, so my friend and I decided to check it out.
