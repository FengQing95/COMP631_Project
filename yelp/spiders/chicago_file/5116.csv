The Purple Pig////Food here is served tapas style and if you are two I would recommend ordering 3 to 4 dishes.  My friend and I ordered 5 and it was a little much but we were just so tempted by what we saw on the menu.  The highlights for me were the milk braised pork shoulder and the ricotta gnocchi.  First off I loved the sauce that they served the gnocchi in and they were so light.  In my experience most restaurants make gnocchi too dense but the Purple Pig got it right.  Sadly we were too full to order dessert but believe me when I say I wanted to so badly.
