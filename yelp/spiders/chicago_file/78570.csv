Little Goat Diner////I will say that despite the fact that the menu mentioned the French toast having egg, I completely forgot about it by the time we received it. Come to find out, it was inside the toast. So good and complemented the sweetness of the toast and syrup so well. Having said that, I think if I had to choose the Okonomiyaki was my favorite.
