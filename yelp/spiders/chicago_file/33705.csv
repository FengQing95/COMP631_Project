Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////There really are not too many words that can express how unreal this place is.  The service is unreal, drinks are outstanding, and food..... well the food is a experience your just going to have to figure out on your own.  The ownership, Management, Servers, food runners, bussers are extremely knowledgeable and extremely polite.  I am big on restaurants in Chicago and as of 2015 out of all the restaurants in Chicago Bavette's is my #1 favorite restaurant.
