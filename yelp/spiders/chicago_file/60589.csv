Smoque BBQ////Brisket chili: A special that I've had the last two times here- hopefully it will become a permanent menu fixture. Personally I prefer pinto beans to the large kidney beans that populate this chili, but the brisket is so good you kind of forget that you are eating chili and not just foraging for meat gold.
