Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First the good stuff:  I am a long time Chicago area native, this is my favorite deep dish.  Love the crust(I like the regular better than the buttercrust upgrade).  Always order a sausage, mushroom, onion - but like some of the other reviewers, don't like the way they have the sausage as one large piece the same diameter as the pizza.  The flavor is great, so we order it with "sausage crumbles" to take care of the too much sausage ratio.  The salad was good, really enjoy our meal every time!
