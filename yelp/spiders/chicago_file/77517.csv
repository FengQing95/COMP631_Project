Little Goat Diner////The portions are pretty big for a single individual some of us shared so it made it easier on our stomach. The consistency between the same dishes order at the same table was off. The little goat who goes to china was super salty for one of us and the other dish of the same item was just right. I'm not sure if they were made differently or not, but something was not right.
