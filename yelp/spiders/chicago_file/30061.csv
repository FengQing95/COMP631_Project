Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////cheesus crust. If there's ever a tomatoe shortage I know who the culprit is. Food was alright but I thought I ordered a pizza and a salad not a tomato with lettuce and a tomato with toppings. There were tomato's on everything. My salad was covered, my pizza had tomato sauce and full slices. We're good on the red veggie/fruit.
