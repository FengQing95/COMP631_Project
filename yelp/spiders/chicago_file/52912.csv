Smoque BBQ////I had been hearing great things about the new BBQ joint, Smoque,  but also heard it had been really crowded since it opened.  I decided to wait a few months before attempting to go since I don't like crowds or waiting for food when I'm hungry.  We happened to be in the area recently.  It was a weekday and around closing time and thought it was a perfect opportunity to finally try it.  It wasn't crowded at all and it only took about 15 minutes to get our order.  We tried the brisket, St. Louis ribs, pulled pork, macaroni, baked beans, and corn bread.  Wow.  It was all very good, but I especially loved the ribs.  I love ribs, but the smoky smell and flavor of these were unlike any I had ever had.  I found myself daydreaming of these ribs and decided to try them for a party about a month later.  We catered from Smoque and had the same items as above plus the coleslaw.  Everyone loved the food.  My husband picked up the food and I highly recommend getting the styrofoam containers to keep the food warm. The food stayed very warm until it was ready to serve about 2 hours later.  Don't throw away the containers though.  They charge an arm and a leg for them.  Eating this food made me go out and get my husband a smoker for his birthday last month.  I'm hoping he can replicate  some of the flavors of this place.
