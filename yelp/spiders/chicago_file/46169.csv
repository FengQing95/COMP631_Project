Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Excellent spanish cuisine, true to the art! We came on a Sunday night and it was packed, just goes to show how good the place is. We had the octopus, bellota ham, steak and blue cheese, patatas bravas, pork-wrapped dates, and all were delicious. Never bland, or uninteresting, but with a good zing and just the right amount of spice. We also had a pitcher of the seasonal sangria and it was quite refreshing, not too sweet and, again, not run-of-the-mill. Highly recommended.
