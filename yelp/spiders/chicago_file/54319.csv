Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I wish I came with a bigger group so I could have tried more things on the menu, but 6 tapas for 4 people was plenty for us already. I was pretty obsessed with their roasted dates with bacon and apple vinaigrette (so juicy and flavorful...did not even know I could like dates), meatballs with sherry tomato sauce (I love meatballs, and don't think sherry tomatoes are anything special, but whatever they did with this combo made it so delicious), and spicy potatoes with tomato alioli (just all kinds of amazing, definitely fancier than your regular home fries lol). The other things didn't wow me just because of my personal preferences (not crazy about blue cheese, goat cheese, or seafood). Feast your eyes on these pics from our meal:
