Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We waited about 30 minutes on a Friday around 7 pm.  The restaurant was pretty small so there was a constant shuffling of bodies between the front door and the host/bar.  We ordered our pizza when we put our names down and I'm glad they offer that.  You could be there all night if you wait until you're seated.  The bar is very small but busy and it's hard to get the attention of the bartenders, let alone find a seat.
