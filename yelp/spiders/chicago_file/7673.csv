Art Institute of Chicago////What a great museum and it's so big. We were there for 3-4 hours and still didn't see everything. They've got a good variety of things. It's so beautiful, too. I like it better than any of the museums I've been to in LA. The view of the city was nice, too. Everyone in the museum was very helpful to point me to what I was looking for.
