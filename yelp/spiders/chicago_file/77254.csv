Little Goat Diner////The more casual sister restaurant to Girl and the Goat. A diner that is so much more than that. A photo booth while you are waiting, one side is a coffee/ pastry shop the other serves full meals. We had to have reservations for lunch. The goat chili was recommended by the server, and they should know. I was hesitant but went with it and was so glad I did. Excellent, elevated grill cheese, mac and cheese and craft cocktails. Not an inexpensive linch but enjoyable nonetheless. $89 for three of is.
