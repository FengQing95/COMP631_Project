Art Institute of Chicago////The moment I stepped into the room full of nearly nothing besides El Greco paintings, I knew this museum would forever hold a place in my heart as one of my favorites. The holdings here are in the U.S. unmatched, save for the Metropolitan in New York, and I love that it's in a city that (from this visitor's perspective) is so frickin awesome but generally forgotten because it's stuck in U.S. no-man's land of the Midwest.
