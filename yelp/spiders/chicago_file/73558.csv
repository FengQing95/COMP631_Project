Little Goat Diner////This is a disappointment as we are both fans of Girl and the Goat and Duck Duck Goat. I'm shocked at how well this place is rated. My cousin had the All American burger and said it was alright. My other cousin had a sandwich that he said was basically an Italian beef that you can get anywhere. Do yourself a favor and eat at one of the many other places near Randolph.
