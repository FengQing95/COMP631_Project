Little Goat Diner////Best brunch of my life!  We had the indian flatbread and the french toast with chicken.  Both dishes were out of this world.  Price, portion, atmosphere, service were all perfect!  While I wish they took reservations, I like their texting program so you can see where you are in line and how much longer you have to wait.  Very thoughtful restaurant!
