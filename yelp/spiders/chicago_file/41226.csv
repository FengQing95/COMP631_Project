Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Delicious and tapas style. Came here two weeks ago for a friend's birthday. We were a group of 8 and ordered almost everything on the menu including 3 pitchers of sangria. Not overpriced at all and every single thing we ate was amazing. If I had to suggest just a few things: the scallops, mushrooms, spicy potatoes, and eggplant salad.
