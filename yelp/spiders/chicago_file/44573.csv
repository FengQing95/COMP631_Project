Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food is solid, consistent, and good. Highlights: paella, stuffed mushrooms, spicy patatas bravas, costillas (short ribs), pincho de solomillo (beef skewers) etc. The wine flights are very mellow... they pick thin wines. We found their sangria to be weak. The real winner here is the dessert pinxtos. Single bite cake. Why not?
