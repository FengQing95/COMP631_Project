Art Institute of Chicago////The special exhibits are incredible, nothing I'd ever seen. They have some incredible examples of Chicago architecture, a personal favorite of mine. And so many pieces of art...my feet hurt from all the walking, but I'd go back in a NY minute to this incredible Chicago museum.
