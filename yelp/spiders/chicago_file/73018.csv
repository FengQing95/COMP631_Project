Little Goat Diner////Menu was extensive and food tasted amazing. Made a reservation and went there for dinner on a Friday evening. Service was good although the restaurant was packed. We had the reuben, sloppy goat, fried chicken and smoked fries. All were amazing and I especially loved the smoked fries. I would recommend Little Goat to anyone who is looking for an unique brunch/diner option.
