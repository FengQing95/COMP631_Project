Smoque BBQ////1st stop on a recent culinary tour of Chicago.  In town for three days staying at the Chicago Hilton.  Grab the blue line to Irving Park where I meet my brother who drove in from the west suburbs.  Light rain, and the Cubs were at home, so fortunately there was no line as described in other reviews.  Can see why locals line up.  We ordered a pulled pork platter and a brisket platter.  Platters came with slaw and choice of two sides. Brisket was delicious, pulled pork was excellent.  After having experienced the pulled pork at Smith's luau in Kauai (whole hog cooked 24 hours in an earth hot stone pit) I have yet to find an equivalent anywhere.  The sides we ordered were Mac&Cheese, Fries, Peach Cobbler, and the brisket chili.  Most notable was the brisket chili.  Was lucky.  Noticed that they had just finished slicing brisket, and they had put all the scrapings in the brisket chili pot prior to serving my portion.  Prices from my perspective as a New Yorker were a bargain for barbecue.  Would spend at least 40% more for the same platters in the city.  One of the reasons I love coming to Chicago is the BYOB, which we took advantage of at Smoque with their blessings.  Will save the 5th star for our next trip when we try the ribs.  The rib standard for me thus far is Rendez Vous in Memphis.  Next stop Hot Doug's for a snack.
