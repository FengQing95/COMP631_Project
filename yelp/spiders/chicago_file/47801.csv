Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our service was good, the food was delicious, and it was well timed. Stand out dishes we thought were the lamb kebobs, meatballs, bacon wrapped dates and the endive and blue cheese salad. The last dish seriously I want to eat an entree size portion of it right this second it was so good. We also tried the sangria of the day, pomegranate, and it was amazing.
