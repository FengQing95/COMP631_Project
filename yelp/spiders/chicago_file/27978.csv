Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've had the opportunity to try out Lou Malnati's numerous times throughout my life and everytime it feels like I'm just eating to quench my hunger, not that the food is good. Lou's is about as average as you can get. I'm not a fan of the crust either, it's a razor sharp brick that poorly tries to imitate Home Run Inn's butter crust and it takes away from the entire experience. By far the deep dish is their better pie. The sausage layer it has actually saves the day in some cases.
