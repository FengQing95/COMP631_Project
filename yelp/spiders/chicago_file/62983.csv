Smoque BBQ////As we were leaving at 11:50am, a huge line started to form. We had beaten the lunch crowd. I also got to see Carlos in action. He not only welcomes guests and cleans tables but he is the enforcer too. Some guy was trying to save a table even though his party was at the back of the line. He very diplomatically informed the guy that he had to get others seated who were in front. I love that!!! Good for you Smoque for defending the rights of the hungry people needing a spot to eat. You have got this down to a science.
