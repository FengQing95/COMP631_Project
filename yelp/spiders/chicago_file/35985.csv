Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////An hour passed. The bartender asked if I wanted to order dinner. I mentioned that I was waiting for my table and asked if she would mind checking the status. In a few moments a gentleman approached. With numerous apologies he explained they had, indeed, lost me. He said my drinks would obviously be taken care of and pointed out several tables and told me to take my pick. I chose a large booth and settled into the deep red leather seat.
