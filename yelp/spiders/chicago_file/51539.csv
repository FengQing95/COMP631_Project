Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Excellent!! Our service was friendly and efficient. The food was so good and moderately priced. We tried the spicy potatoes (awesome), the fried green peppers (weird, but tasty), the Brussels sprout salad (best salad I've ever had), and the tomato bread(my personal favorite!). We will return again!!
