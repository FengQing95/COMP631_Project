Smoque BBQ////Ummm.... I'LL HAVE SOME MORE OF YOU PLEASE!!!! =D We decided to FINALLY try this place after my neighbors catered their annual memorial day party from this place. My family ordered the combo ribs, sliced brisket, texas sausage, & our sides were mac & cheese, brisket chili, french fries, cornbread, & peach cobbler for dessert (thanks to our neighbors, we've OD'd on bread pudding).... Â Bless me father for I have sinned by cheating the poop out of cheat day.... Oh, we'll be back....
