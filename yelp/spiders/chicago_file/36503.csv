Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I had the petite duchess filet, and added the bone marrow and butter.   The bone marrow was 100% worth it,  and while the butter was nice, it wasn't necessary.  My filet was perfectly cooked (medium rare) and in combination with the marrow tasted like butter. I debated getting the bone in filet, but it just seemed like too much food, which is why I opted for the smaller cut.
