Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Third, and most importantly, the food was excellent.  We started with a wedge salad.  Cold, crisp lettuce with the perfect amount of creamy dressing (I would have preferred blue to ranch, but that's just preference and I knew what I was getting when I ordered) with a hint of dill and what the frig?  Two slices of thick cut bacon?  Best wedge salad ever.  For entrees we got the shortrib stroganoff and the bone-in dry aged ribeye.  The stroganoff was delicious.  Noodles cooked perfectly, the sauce accentuated the mushrooms and meat instead of covering them up, the meat was tender.  Really well done.  And the steak, while not the best I have ever had, was still excellent.  It was done perfectly to order.  Nice crust, juicy, tender meat, seasoned well.  I did not use the béarnaise, but I did use the seasoned salt blend that was provided, and that stuff is magic.  The asparagus and bacon sides were on par with the rest of the meal.
