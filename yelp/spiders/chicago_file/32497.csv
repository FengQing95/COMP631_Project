Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Yum!! First time trying Chicago deep dish and it was great! Really loved the sausage layer on the pizza - I like that they're not just meatball size and you have some in every bite. Just a heads up it takes about 30-35 to prepare the pizza so it'll be a bit of a wait. We got here around 12 and were seated indoors, not a lot of ppl in but by the time we left almost every table was occupied.
