Art Institute of Chicago////Like any museum, the Art Institute is a massive hall of mazes that you can easily get lost in, but beautiful mazes at that. Now even for someone like me who is not really into looking at art, even I appreciated the famous works of art that were housed inside --- Picasso's Old Guitarist, Grant Wood's American Gothic, Gustave Caillebotte Paris Street: Rainy Day, Edward Hopper's Nighthawks, Georges Seurat's A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte --- just to name a few (and yes, I had to look those up, but I DID recognize them while I was there even if I didn't know the artist.) Since I'm not an art expert, I can only summarize that there were various exhibits for all to look at and by the time you get to the end your head will probably be spinning with names of artists you cannot even pronounce.
