Smoque BBQ////Smoque is outstanding.  Just go now.  Our favorites are the chopped brisket sandwich, the ridiculously good, best we've ever had fries  AND mac and cheese, and my partner loves the ribs.  I even had a salad there a couple of times, and it was surprisingly fresh and fantastic (kind of unexpected for a "meat" place).  Nice outside seating now too, and BYOB.  Seriously great BBQ place.  Best in the city. Go.
