Smoque BBQ////My favorite food spot when visiting Chicago. This isn't a ritzy place but the food is amazing and probably the best BBQ I've ever had. My boyfriend and I shared the baby back ribs, french fries, cornbread, and coleslaw and we were stuffed with happiness. Their BBQ sauce was on point, and everything truly had a "smoquey" flavor.
