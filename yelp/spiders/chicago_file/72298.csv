Little Goat Diner////If you love fried chicken, you know there is nothing better than the crispiness of fried chicken right out of the fryer / oven. By extension, there is nothing more tragic than the sogginess of fried chicken that has been sitting for just a bit too long. And for someone who loves the savory / sweet contrast, I found that the dish did not have enough of either.
