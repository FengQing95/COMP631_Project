Smoque BBQ////We've been getting regular takeout from here since the lockdown and I have to say, these guys do a fantastic job packaging their food to go. Must-haves are: the St. Louis ribs, the vinegar-y coleslaw, the cornbread, and my favorite - the gumbo. (Pro-tip: order by phone and get the quart-sized slaw and gumbo sides -- those are good for several small adult lunches over the course of the week.)
