Art Institute of Chicago////I usually go a few times a year to the AI. Just recently saw the Impressionism, Fashion, and Modernity exhibit. One of the most thrilling exhibits in a long time that I have seen - Featuring 75 major figure paintings by Caillebotte, Degas, Manet, Monet, Renoir, and Seurat. Could spend hours in these galleries alone.
