Little Goat Diner////What a food experience!!! Oh my. Tonight went to little goat with a private group. We used the private room upstairs with the open kitchen and terrace. The atmosphere is so quaint and cozy - we loved it! But nothing could have prepared us for the culinary journey we were about to embark on. We tasted flavors pairings we could never have imagined. Tarragon butter, scallops, tuna, goat empanadas, salted caramel NY strip, sole with Mediterranean yogurt, all topped off with chocolate pavlova for dessert. Every bite was an explosion of flavor. My review can't do it justice, you'll have to try for yourself. You won't be sorry! Yum!
