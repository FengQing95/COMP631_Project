Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////About the pizza itself, I was not impressed either. I've had Giordano's and Pizano's before, and I enjoyed both of them so I was expecting this one to be even better. But this pizza was just so average in comparison. First, it was lukewarm when it came out. Second, it didn't even look that thick. The flavor was fine, but it was nothing special.
