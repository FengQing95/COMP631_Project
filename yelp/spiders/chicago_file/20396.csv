Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Very delicious! We came to compare it to Giordano's. Verdict: Giordano's in Navy Pier is better.  However, I did really like this place. I would still come back. We got a free appetizer since we joined their email club, which was awesome. The pizza was less expensive than Giordano's. I would so come back. Service was great. Wait wasn't that long for a table at 8pm on a Sunday evening.  Must try both everyone!
