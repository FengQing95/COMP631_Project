Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When the pizza came, the server served it to us on our plates. These pizzas are generous with cheese, so perfect for a cheese lover! The server was patient and greatly accommodating. She recommended us items on the menu to get since it was our first time in Chicago trying deep dish.
