Art Institute of Chicago////With tired feet and several hours in the museum under our belt, we were satisfied with our time at the museum as we headed towards the exit before they closed at 5pm (8pm on Thursdays). Â But not without a visit to the gift shop, where I read more about Grant Wood, the painter of American Gothic, and saw a photo of his sister and his dentist (his models for the couple in American Gothic) beside the painting.
