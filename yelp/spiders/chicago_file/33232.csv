Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This might be the best restaurant in the city of Chicago.  The martinis and appetizers are out of this world.  The tab runs high, but you get what you pay for at this spot.  I went here for a work outing and couldn't have been happier with the choice.  The beef stroganoff and cherry foie gras were the best i've had.
