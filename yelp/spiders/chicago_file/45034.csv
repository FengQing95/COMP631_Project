Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Food is always delicious .  this is my favorite Mexican tapas restaurant in Chicago.  The menu has a wide variety of tapas which include great vegetarian options for friends.  Me and my friends have been here for more than one occasions. .  the peach sangria pitcher is a great option with smooth and crisp peach flavor and fruits that are soaking in the sangria which are enjoying to eat.  The fish tapa was delicious with nice interior flaking an crispiness on the outside.  The Bacon wrapped dates seem to be a classic and have a unique taste to it with the crispy Bacon and sweet date flavor and makes a great combo.  The empanadas are delicious as well.  The service is always great.  A great option for a dinner date as you can share many plates for a reasonable and affordable price as well, and too it off with the sangria.
