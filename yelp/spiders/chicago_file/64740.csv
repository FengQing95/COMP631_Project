Smoque BBQ////Everyone tried the brisket, pulled pork, baby backs, St. Louis ribs, chicken, mac & cheese and cornbread for sides.  We did not try the Texas sausage. You can also 'add a taste' for $4-$6.00 which is great for sampling.  Chicken was juicy and moist, DELISH - Brisket came in as the winner, runner up's:  pulled pork & St. Louis ribs.  Although these were not fall of the bone ribs, they were tasty & meaty, but I wanted them to be more tender.  The spice rub is not overpowering, the meat is not 'overly smoky'.  Love the rub and you could go without any sauce.  Pulled pork was tender & tasty.  Sides were great as well, but you come here for the BBQ.
