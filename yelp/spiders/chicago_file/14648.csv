Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////You go in, tell them what you want and then you go grab a drink or 8 and when you sit down you don't have to wait for your pizza to cook cause this thing is a solid 3 feet high and packed with 17 pounds of ingredients. OK so maybe I'm exaggerating a little bit, but what I will not exaggerate about is the portion size. PLEASE TRUST THE MENU. I thought I was a big eater until I was humbled by this pizza. My friend and I opted for the 4 person serving. We ate it all under the assumption that the leftovers wouldn't taste as good the next day. Just because something is true doesn't mean you should do it. I got food wasted and walked around the river walk trying to hold in everything.
