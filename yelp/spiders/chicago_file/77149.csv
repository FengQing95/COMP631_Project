Little Goat Diner////The food was good and aesthetically pleasing but the flavor was a bit off. For example, I got a special item for that time called a ropa, this tasted okay, but the flavor was too sweet for its own good. In all honesty, I wouldn't come back here. But if your in the area stop by the cafe and get the hot chocolate which was very good.
