Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is my third trip to Chicago, and my first chance at going out for a classic deep dish pizza. We ordered the combination appetizer and a small deep dish (The Lou) with the butter crust. I could have had the appetizers as a meal on it's own! Skip the appetizer, go with the pizza.
