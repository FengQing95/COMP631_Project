Smoque BBQ////After ordering my boyfriend and I were seated very quickly, but I was squished between a pair of Chicago police officers and an overweight couple. So this was annoying and awkward. Holding a conversation was difficult being in such close proximity to the other people, and being bumped by the man next to me multiple times made it even worse. Now I know why they can seat people so quickly- no one wants to stay and eat when it means you are forced into dining 3 inches away from complete strangers.
