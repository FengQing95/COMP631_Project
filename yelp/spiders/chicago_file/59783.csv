Smoque BBQ////The place was packed but it was a real orderly operation with a guy finding a table for you while you waited in line. So clever. I got the pulled pork sammich while Hubster had the chopped brisket. We both got mac 'n cheese as a side since we spied it at other tables and it looked great.
