Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////After dining at Gilt Bar and Maude's Liquor bar, I paid my first visit to Bavette's last night. My boyfriend and I had a 10:15 reservation for drinks. I started out with a Mint Julep. We had the peppered duck and goat cheese terrine. I'm typically weary of duck dishes but this was wonderful. We finished the evening with the ice cream sundae and two Jameson shots with a spiced pickleback- amazing! I was just as impressed with Bavette's as I have been with the other Hogsalt restaurants. The atmosphere is quieter and upscale with grandiose chandeliers and cozy booth seating. It's safe to say I'll be back.
