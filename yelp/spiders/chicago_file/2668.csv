The Purple Pig////I love the unique gated entrance into the restaurant, they have a covered, outdoor seating area with heat lamps, and the inside is very cute. The tables are a bit close to each other, though, so when you're stripping off your heavy winter coats, scarves, mittens and hats it's a bit of a tight squeeze.
