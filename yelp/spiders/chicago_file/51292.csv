Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Let's get one thing straight from the get-go.  Pan con tomate means Bread with tomato.  It doesn't mean bread with tomato, arugula manchego, anchovies, iberico or whatever other Spanish ingredient you can think to put on top of it.  It means bread with tomato.  The success of such a dish depends on having high quality super ripe tomatoes, combined with bread that has been toasted after being brushed with a scant amount of olive oil and just lightly rubbed with a bit of garlic.  When you have pan con tomate on the menu and you bring out this abomination that has all this extra bull s*** on it you embarrass yourself.  This is not Spanish food.  I wanted what I ordered, and what the menu said it was.  Simple refreshing bread with tomato.   The kind that is so good that you marvel at how something so simple can be so tasty can be so elegant and delicious.
