Little Goat Diner////Amazing food that doesn't break the bank. I haven't been to Girl and the Goat yet but I have a feeling I would like this place better. I came here for brunch with some friends and it was super easy to make a reservation online. The interior is really clean/modern looking and provides a nice ambience. There is even outdoor seating. For the food I tried the fish tacos which were amazing. Everything about it was unique from the chickpeas to the slaw to the tortilla shells. But it worked really well and was delicious without tasting heavy or greasy. I also tried the summer shrimp salad which I would get again. It was very light and refreshing and fresh, but definitely still filling. Â I would love to come back here!
