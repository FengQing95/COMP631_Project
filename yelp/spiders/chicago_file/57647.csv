Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Favorite tapas restaurant! Never a disappointment. Tried almost all tapas from their menu. Last time we actually ordered sea food paella, it was very good! Sangria is one of my favorite drinks and at Cafe they do great job making it and have a good variety. Our server gave us great suggestion when it came to desert.
