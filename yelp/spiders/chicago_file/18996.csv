Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When we entered the jam-packed restaurant on North State Street a little after 9pm on a Friday night, put our name on a list for a table and pre-ordered our pizza at the counter. After a short wait, we were guided to a seat and a few minutes later our delicious half cheese, half pepperoni deep-dish pizza arrived. It was SO FREAKING GOOD. So good in fact, that we had the left-overs for breakfast the next day!
