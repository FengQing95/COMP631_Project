Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've lived in Chicago for about five years now and am a bit ashamed to say that I have only now begun to seek out Deep Dish pizza.  My first step in this direction was a recent stop in at Lou Malnati's.  First things first, I am a big pizza hog.  Anytime the choice comes up, I'm all over it like white on rice.  I can't get enough of these meaty, cheesy, full of goodness pies.  I did have some reservations for Lou's though because while I love pizza, I'm not a huge fan of pizza sauce.  I know I know, its crazy and I should consider seeking help.  We sat down after being told it was a twenty minute wait on a very busy night, which was absolutely fine because of the free samples of pizza they were handing out at the hostess stand.  We are eventually seated and order our pizza, the classic deep dish with sausage and decided what the hell?  Let's get the buttery crust as well.  About twenty minutes later our pizza is served and we are feasting on a very well made pizza.  There wasn't too much pizza sauce on it and the sausage was really good.  The buttery crust was a very good addition to the pizza, I recommend it.  The trip proved to be cheaper than any of us expected which is always a big plus.  I will definitely be back and I'm now convinced I should continue my quest of further discovering deep dish pizza.  Thank you Lou.
