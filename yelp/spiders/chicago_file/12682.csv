Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I recently got to visit Chicago for the first time to attend the Chicago Underground Film Festival. We held out on eating pizza while we were there so that we could try this place. I've been to Zachary's in Berkeley, so I have an idea of what Chicago style pizza's gonna be. Yeah, we had to wait for awhile, but as tourists we had plenty of time to burn. We got to sit outside, a big plus, since it was a warm and summery night. We ordered the deep dish buttercrust with mushrooms, spinach and olives. So we finally get our pizza and let me tell you, it was truly delish! It was a bit runnier than I thought it was going to be, but I didn't care. The sauce was so tasty, not too sweet or tangy as some tomato sauces tend to be, but just truly melded to perfection. Ok, so I live in San Francisco and sorry, Zachary's, you lost on the sauce. Zachary's sauce is too California raw tomato-y for my taste. Definitely a super hearty meal that I couldn't eat everyday, but a special treat for special occasions!
