Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came here for lunch on our last day in Chicago and we were not dissapointed. I had been to another location, but this one was a bit better. They crisped the pizza perfectly here and it was extra cheesy. We ordered the classic deep dish, but also ordered a pepperoni thin crust which was also really good. To satisfy our sweet tooth, we ordered their chocolate chip pizza which was so darn good. It was a chocolate chip cookie cooked in the deep dish pan, topped with vanilla bean ice cream and whipped cream (please note this is enough to share between 2-3 people). Overall, our experience was good and I would return to this place without a doubt.
