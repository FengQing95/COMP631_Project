Little Goat Diner////The menu is diverse and has something for Â everyone. We started with the crab dip that was out of this world! Real crab meat, cheesy, and hot..what more could you ask for? I got the Apple cinnamon pancakes that were delicious and well-priced! I even took home leftovers (anyone who knows me knows that never happens). Everyone raves about the hashbrowns but to be honest I didn't like them. They had a weird oily aftertaste, but everyone else was on the bandwagon.
