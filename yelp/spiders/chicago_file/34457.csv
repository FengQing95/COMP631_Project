Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Wow! Loved this place. My boyfriend took me here Friday evening for my birthday. It was delicious, very romantic and just gorgeous. Service = A. Really good, unobtrusive, smooth, perfectly timed. Never rushed. We ordered the duck and goat cheese terrine appetizer. Do this! I have to admit, it doesn't look super, super appetizing. My BF commented that it reminded him of Fancy Feast, ha! But it tasted wonderful, and the apricot/mustard jam was to die for. I got the petite filet mignon and BF got the lamb t-bone. Both excellent. He said his was a bit fatty, but it tasted spectacular with the rosemary. We split a loaded baked potato. Oh, and I had the BEST martini of my life. Literally. A vodka dirty martini with bleu cheese olives. Glass was huge, and yet she still brought a carafe with probably 2 shots more of the "extra" that didn't fit in the glass. Amazing. No one does this. Super classy. My BF got a lovely glass of wine. When the bill came, our drinks weren't on it. We mentioned it to our waitress (because we're honest people) and she was super sweet and just said thanks for telling me, but don't worry about it. Again, classy move. Needless to say she got an even bigger tip than before. Anyway, loved this place. Would definitely go back for special occasions (cuz it ain't cheap, baby). But SO worth it.
