Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////As far as service goes our waitress was nothing special but not horrible, except for the fact that she seemed to think her customers were idiots. She repeatedly tried to explain everything about the food and what Tapas was after we told her we had a great deal of experience with this particular form of cuisine.
