Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I found this place while searching for Chicago deep dish pizza. We arrived just after 7 pm and were seated immediately. We were able to quickly place the order for a Classic pizza (which takes about 30-40 min to bake). We also ordered a house salad, which the waiter made sure would be big enough for two to share.
