Little Goat Diner////The Little Piggy Went To China: The biscuit, egg, pork, smoked blueberries all tasted GREAT.  The chili garlic chive sauce is directly out of Girl and the Goat and I didn't care for it. I think Lao Gan Ma is great, FlyByJing is great, Momofuku is great.  This chili sauce is not very good and doesn't really lend itself to tying everything together.  If the sauce were different, I'd get it again.  otherwise 3.75/5
