Art Institute of Chicago////But, once we got there, we realized that we did need to do a few things in between meals to work up our appetites, so we found our way to the Art Institute. And, we were really glad we did! The collection was extremely impressive, and the gallery had done a really excellent job with the displays. American Gothic was no more impressive in-person, but the Seurat was awesome to see up close.
