Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////To start off, our table started off with burnt and stone cold bread.  I was a bit put off by this, but nevermind, we weren't here to eat bread anyway.  It was paella week, and we ordered the special valencia paella, as well as the bacon wrapped dates, the garlic shrimp, the goat cheese with bread, and the lamb skewers.  We also ordered a full pitcher of the special pear sangria.
