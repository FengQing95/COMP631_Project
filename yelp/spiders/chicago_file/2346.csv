The Purple Pig////The Purple Pig is one of the premier foodie places to visit in downtown Chicago and I'm glad I finally decided to try it. We went for lunch on a Saturday and there was a two hour wait. Don't worry because you can first put your name down and they will call you about 15 minutes prior to when your table will be ready. In the meantime, do some shopping or get some popcorn for a small snack!
