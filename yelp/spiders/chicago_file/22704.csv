Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I wanted to like this place and maybe it was because I got a personal sized pizza, but honestly, my pizza tasted like a microwaveable pizza. I got pepperoni and green peppers and they served it to me on a plate, I wanted it in a traditional deep dish pan. First strike. Second, the crust was crispy, but there was barely any cheese! Quality control check number one, failed. The green peppers were huge chunks and uneven pieces, quality control check number two, failed. The one positive: the mozzarella sticks with marinara sauce were delicious, hence the two stars. Service was okay, but never had my drink refilled the entire time I was there. Overall, never coming back here. Super bummed. :(
