Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When we sat down around 8:45, our server confirmed the order we already placed and said our 'Classic Lou's Pizza' would be ready shortly. Fast forward over an hour later, still no pizza. We sat there watching pizza after pizza walk by our table. At 10pm, our server finally said she was getting the manager involved and assured us our long-overdue pie would be out in a minute.
