Little Goat Diner////This place is definitely crowded, but with a couple day's planning in advance, you can easily secure a seat for yourself and some friends. I was actually able to book an 8pm dinner table for myself and three friends on the day-of; upon sitting down, you can immediately immerse yourself in the fun-filled environment and decor. The menu is a bit overwhelming, but not to worry, because the waiters were very well-versed in their recommendations. The nachos and salsa with guacamole were probably the highlight of the dinner, despite it only being a group appetizer. The flavor of the dips exquisitely accentuated the baked crispiness of the chips. Wow, what a dish! The Little Goat sandwiches are what we had really come for, and my friends and I were definitely not disappointed. Filling portions came with an array of sauces and dips for the curious palette. Overall, I was very fulfilled by my meal -- and at a low price-point too! Probably one of the highest-quality diners I've had the pleasure of visiting!
