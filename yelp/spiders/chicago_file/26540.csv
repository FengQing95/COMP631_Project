Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were visiting from out of town and had to try this famous Chicago style pizza Lou's was walking distance. Katie was our server, very polite and efficient. We ordered the spinach stuffed bread not knowing what to expect. It was delicious. We got a medium sized pizza. More than enough for the 2 of us. That cheese was delicious. Im not a fan of the deep dish type crust but non the less the pizza was good and so was the butter crust
