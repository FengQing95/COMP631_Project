Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////They were also very, very friendly concerning my gluten free needs.  Sometimes, places make me feel bad about asking about what items are gf. (Which seriously offends me btw, I didn't choose to have celiac disease).  The waiter, Daniel was amazing about it and would even tell me when there was malt on an item.  Most places think it is just wheat, but he even knew about the malt and barely side of gluten as well.  Props to our waiter.
