Smoque BBQ////Crazy good y'all! A little out of the way but totally worth it. Probably the best pulled pork and brisket I have had out.  I am very picky about BBQ. We liked the 2 sauces mixed together. Get the Mac and cheese and peach cobbler. Stop at the Walgreens and get a six pack. It is BYOB. Friendly staff. We got lucky-no line.  I would have totally waited.
