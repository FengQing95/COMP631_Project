Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great atmosphere, great beers on tap and in the bottle and an awesome introduction to Chicago style pizza. Only mistake I made was issuing a personal size which is not served in the skillet. Order the small size if you are looking for a small portion. Even if you don't finish, it's worth having it served in the skillet.
