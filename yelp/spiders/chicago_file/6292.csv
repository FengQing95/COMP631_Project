The Purple Pig////Yes, it lives up to the hype! My family of three shared the crispy pig ear, chicken thigh kebabs and braised pork belly for lunch. Every.single.ingredient in each dish was well thought out and complimented each other to pack in the flavor. Our LO could not get enough of the crispy pig ear dish, especially the kale.  The chicken kebabs were perfectly cooked and seasoned. And the pork belly was the best pork belly I've ever had! Honestly, I've been craving it since! Herberito was our waiter and he was super friendly and informative. They didn't have sangria in the drink menu, but he did his best and it was good! Everyone was wearing a mask (besides diners at their tables) and they even took our temp upon arrival.  They also made sure to space out the customers. It was a memorable foodie experience and I can't wait to come back!
