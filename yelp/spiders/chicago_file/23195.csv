Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered a medium sized pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, with extra cheese deep dish. The pizza was delicious. What I remember most is the plum tomatoes on the pizza and how juicy they were. My husband and I were only able to eat 3 1/2 of the 6 slices. That's how filling this pizza is. Our table was not 100% cleaned properly but I guess with all the business they do in a day the table will have a few extra crumbs on the side and the floors will be a bit sticky. I give 3 stars for cleanliness.
