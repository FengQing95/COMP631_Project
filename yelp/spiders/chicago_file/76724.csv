Little Goat Diner////I ordered the 'This Little Piggy Went to China" which had a sesame cheddar biscuit with sunny side up eggs, szechuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce and blackberries. The "szechuan" should've given it away for me. The flavor is very similar to spicy wontons. Also had the tempura mashed potatoes, which was interesting and not bad.
