The Purple Pig////Everything we ordered on the menu was absolutely fabulous. We ordered the tuna tartare which was so good, and an absolute must try if you are coming here for the first time. Next, we ordered the meat and cheese board with 5 options. The selection was good, I only wish there were more of the crackers that came with the board. Third we had the bone marrow smear which wasn't the highlight of the meal, but definitely worth trying. Fourth we had this amazing freshly made pasta! We tried ordering the special that was on the menu, but since they sold out our server recommended her favorite instead, which looking back I don't believe was listed on the menu, it came with a browned butter sauce (see photos). Last we had the bread pudding for dessert which was the perfect end to dinner. We were told the cheesecake is their most popular, opted for the bread pudding because our meal consisted of a lot of cheese already.
