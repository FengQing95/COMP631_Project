Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Be prepared to yell because the noise level of the back room is off the scale.  Only 2 tables empty so it was pretty full and the low ceilings provided awful acoustics.  Otherwise, clean, a little on the bright side, and lots of sports jerseys framed on the wall.  2 TVs straddle the corners of the room keeping a watchful eye on the diners.
