Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I came with a mixed group of international business partners, and found that they really appreciated Spain's more 'eastern' tradition of sharing plates.  We were a large group, so we ordered a  good mix of tapas & large dishes: bacon-wrapped dates (not as good as Toro in Boston, but good), sea scallops, serrano ham, sausages, and calamari. Then we got 1 of each of the brochetas (like a metal skewer that hangs from a pole on the table).  This was nice a great way to share with the others, and the presentation was great.  After all of that meat,  we shared the seafood paella (note: we were 8 people).  We drank sangria throughout and it didn't disappoint.
