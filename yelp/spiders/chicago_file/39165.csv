Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We each got a steak, which were also the best we've had, and a bunch of sides. The elotes really stood out. We also got the truffle mac and cheese. Â Will definitely be back as soon as possible, we recommend to everybody and think it is the best meal you can get in the city.
