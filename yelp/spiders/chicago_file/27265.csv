Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I wasn't dying of hunger so my partner and I ordered a small "Lou" pizza. The pizza is big enough to feed two kinda-moderately hungry adults. Each person will get two slices. The Lou pizza is a deep dish pizza with spinach garlic mix, three cheese mix, and sliced tomatoes on time. I would give the pizza 10/10 for its aesthetics and amazing cheese pull. However, I wish the pizza was more flavorful. The spinach mix just tasted really salty to me. However, the tomatoes on top helped to cut down on some of the saltiness. The tomatoes could have been jazzed up more by using something other than sliced tomatoes you can find on an average burger. I wanted the crusty to be buttery, flaky and crispy. However, it just tasted like slightly soggy cooked dough. Maybe, I tried the wrong pizza (?) I am not sure. However, I am haven't given up on Chicago deep dish so I am looking forward to a different pizza joint to try out next time.
