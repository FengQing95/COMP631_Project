Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I really wanted to try deep dish pizza while here in Chicago and this is the first place I decided to try and I honestly left disappointed. It wasn't great pizza and if anything their spinach garlic bread thing they had was the best thing I tried. The server was so nice and amazing!! 5 stars there but the pizza wasn't great. Very very few options on customizing pizza and they only had two specialty options. So limited options.
