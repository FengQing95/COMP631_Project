Little Goat Diner////Loooove this place. Was dying to visit little goat and Â it did not disappoint. Went for Sunday brunch. Shared a carafe of mimosa and got the Asian ton Katsu sandwhich. Boyfriend got the corned beef hash. Was all around delicious. Would love to go again and try some of their other menu items. Especially some of their delicious looking sweets. Please open one in la!
