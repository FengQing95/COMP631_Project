Little Goat Diner////My favorite place for a sit-down meal in the downtown area! The espresso is out of this world - the iced latte is a must. Fat Elvis Waffles are a classic with delectable peanut butter butter. This Little Piggy Went to China is perfect for anyone who loves variation in flavor. Undeniably savory sausage and sweet blackberries = perfect. Hop over to the bakery for a to-go coffee and any bagel with the apricot cream cheese. Whole meal is worth the price!
