Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute of Chicago is in my mind meant to be a fine establishment given they show prestigious art from across the globe. I am very fond of the art they display and have never been disappointed in that regard, however I can't say as much for the staff. I am a student at Loyola University Chicago and get free admission into the institute, so whenever I have some free time I like to travel to the museum even if that means I only have twenty minutes to quickly glance around, just for the heck of it. Every time I've come, I've had an awful interaction with the staff behind the ticket desk where they are incredibly snippy with me and just so clearly show their anxiousness to get home. While the institute itself is very nice, it would be drastically better if the staff were not so rude and would learn to not take out their day's irritation on their customers.
