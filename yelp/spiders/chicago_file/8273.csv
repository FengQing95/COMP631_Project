Art Institute of Chicago////Right now it's sad b/c it's all under construction - even though they're just adding on a new Modern Wing apparently the whole museum has to be covered in sawdust!  I can't wait for that to be over with because I feel like I've missed out on some things because they're being held in storage until that wing opens.
