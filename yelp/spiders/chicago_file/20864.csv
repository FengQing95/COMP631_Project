Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////What made this different from say, Giardano's, is that it's thinner and much less cheesier than their pizza, with more tomato sauce and a more buttery crust. So if you want a big thick cheesy pizza, you may want to try other places, but if you want a flavorful balanced pie you should definitely try this place. Also, a size Large here is much smaller than a size Large at Giardano's.
