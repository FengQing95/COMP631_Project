Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ordered the thin crust deep dish sausage pizza through goldbelly and when it arrived the pizza's were completely thawed out. They came in a Styrofoam container but there was NO ice packs (too cheap to add a few ice packs) This caused at least part of the crust to soak up condensation and ruin part of the crust as it was soggy. The crust is odd and not in a good way, sausage was tasteless, cheese was like rubber and the sauce was good but nothing special. Quite small diameter, a lot of money for a small pizza. As my wife said and others too, this is not pizza, more like a quiche or casserole. Would never order again. The walk up & order at Costco pepperoni pizza is far better and just $10.00 for 18" Large or 2 bucks for a large slice.
