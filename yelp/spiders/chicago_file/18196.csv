Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visiting Chicago, of course we had to get deep dish pizza. After careful Yelp research, we chose Lou Malnati's. There were 5 of us so we ordered a large Chicago classic. 4 of us were full off a slice so that leaves 4 slices right? My boyfriend ate half the pizza by himself... Impressive or gross, I don't know. Anyways, the pizza was good. Lots of meat and cheese. I think there should've been more sauce because it was on the dry side. I was disappointed by the crust. I thought there would be more flavor but it was so plain. The server was friendly and attentive. Next time I'm in Chicago, I'll have to see if there's better.
