Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////After living in Madrid, I am always on the lookout for a good Spanish restaurant.  I've been coming to Babareeba for years, and the reason I keep coming back is because this is far and away the best paella I've had outside of Spain.  The paella valenciana is a good choice if you're new to it, but all of their options are delicious.  I judge every place claiming to be a tapas restaurant by their patatas bravas (spicy potatoes), and Babareeba's are among the best I've ever had. Their dates wrapped in bacon, octopus, goat cheese in tomato sauce, and tortilla espanola are all amazing also.  The red sangria is great, and a few pitchers for a group are always a good way to start of an entertaining night.
