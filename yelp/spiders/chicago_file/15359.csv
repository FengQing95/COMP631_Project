Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time eating here and my daughter's introduction to Chicago deep dish. We were not disappointed! We got right in around 6 with just the two of us, and our waitress was great - just chatty enough and good with kids. Ordered a small pepperoni deep dish which was just enough for me to eat 3/4 of and her to eat 1/4. We both loved the cheese and pepperoni, but the best part is the crust! Somehow it's thick without being super dense. Definitely will go again.
