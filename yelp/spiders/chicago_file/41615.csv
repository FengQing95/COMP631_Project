Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////YUM!!! came here for a low key birthday dinner with the roommates. the wait was at least 1 hr to 1.5 hrs when we got there at 6:30pm on a friday night so we opted to eat at the bar instead. this place is huge and really loud. definitely tough to hear anybody you are talking to even if you're sitting next to them. the food was delish! we ordered the crab and shrimp dip, beef empanada, chicken kabab with corn/chick pea salad, calamari, bacon wrapped dates, and the spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms. we also ordered a pitcher of the black raspberry sangria. it seemed a little bit expensive for tapas but it was tasty so i can definitely overlook the price. a reservation would probably be a good idea for next time especially on the weekends. =)
