Little Goat Diner////Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the "This Little Piggy Went to China" and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it's essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn't stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing.
