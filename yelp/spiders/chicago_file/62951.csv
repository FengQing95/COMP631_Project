Smoque BBQ////I have eaten at Smoque more than once - every single time I go to City Smiles next door, I eat at Smoque after. Thats right. I pay money to get my teeth cleaned by professionals (City Smiles has a death metal dentist on staff 5/5) I eat enough ribs to satiate even the most grotesque of appetites.
