Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////3.5 star review.  Good Chicago deep dish - perhaps not the best I've had but solid.  The house salad with red wine vinaigrette was average.  Service was attentive.  We were quoted a 45-minute to an hour wait so we went ahead and pre-ordered our pizza, per their system.  We were delightfully surprised to receive a text about 15 minutes later saying they were ready to seat us.  The one thing that was not to my liking was the noise level in the dining room.  It was ear-piercingly loud, at times, which really detracted from the overall experience.  I will say that a party of six people was seated next to us and when they left, the noise level improved but was still loud.  I'd go back but I'd probably prefer to try a different place over Lou Malnati's.
