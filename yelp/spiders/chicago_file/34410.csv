Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We picked Bavette's for our anniversary dinner because 3 Year Traditional Gift = Leather = Steak. We had a 9:15 reservation. We arrived on time and we were told that they were waiting for a few tables to clear. So we sat in the bar. And sat. And sat. We ordered cocktails, which were tasty. But it took quite a while to get them. We finally were sat at our table at 9:50 ... as if our reservation had been at 9:50. In other words, no apologies, no comped drinks or starters, no "thank you for waiting." Nothing. So already I was irked. I expected better.
