Smoque BBQ////I can't believe that I haven't reviewed this place yet. This is the BEST BRISKET i've ever had in my life. This is coming from a Texan. When I moved here from Texas, I assumed that I would only have good BBQ when I went back home to visit family but this place is amazing! I make the hour hike over here for the fatty, perfectly charred piece of brisket that always makes its way to my plate when I get here. I haven't been in a few weeks and thats a shame. See you next week smoque!
