Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Had the best time at Bavettes for our anniversary dinner!  The server was very nice and knowledgeable.  One thing is that he misunderstood us and gave us a much more expensive steak than the one we ordered.  (Oh we'll) Loved the interior and the bar so much.  Reminded me partly of a Parisian cafe and partly of a speakeasy type place.  It was very dark, which actually worked well, because even thought the place was packed, it didn't seem like it.  Sharing the wine was a really fun and nice community experience - this and the bacon is where the 4th star comes from.
