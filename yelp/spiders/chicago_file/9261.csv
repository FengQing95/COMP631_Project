Art Institute of Chicago////This is such a large museum you will always have something new to see. We visited the Floating World which is ancient Japanese prints. We gained a new appreciation of the simplicity of this work. We also saw the textiles of Islamic Art and a special exhibit on prayers around the world. A different kind of sensory pleasure can be found in the museum cafe on the lower level and it's not to be missed.
