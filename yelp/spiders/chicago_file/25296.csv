Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have gone to Lou Malnati's for their delicious deep dish pizza each of the two times I have visited Chicago. During both of my trips, I tried various other deep dish pizzas (Giordano's, Gino's, Pizzeria Uno), and I have to admit that Lou Malnati's has my favorite all-around deep dish pizza. They win be over with their delicious Buttercrust and perfect combination of cheese, sausage, and tomato sauce in their Malnati Chicago Classic deep dish pizza. Their trio of dips and pizza chips is a great starter if you're into hummus and artichoke-type dips.
