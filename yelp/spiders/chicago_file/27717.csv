Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had a meeting at work and ordered up Pizza from the Wells Street location, it arrived within an hour, was hot.  I suggested to my boss that he order from Lou's, they open at 10:30AM and that worked great for our lunch meeting.   It was a last minute decision by our guy in charge to order pizza.  So our fairly large order went to Lou's, I figured they could handle it.  They did.
