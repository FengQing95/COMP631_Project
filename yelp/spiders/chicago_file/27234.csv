Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's hands down has some of the best Chicago style pizza one can find.  The crust is absolutely amazing, it has the perfect crunch.  There isn't too much cheese but you wouldn't want any less.  The sauce is excellent; but, personally, i don't care for chunks of tomato's in my sauce so i prefer to leave those out.  Now, The Malnati Chicago Classic™, made with Lou's lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on buttercrust, It's authentic Chicago!  This pie is good, but not you need to get small sausage pieces otherwise you will end up having some pizza with your sausage, it's just a little overwhelming Lou, calm it down over there, we don't need any more heart attacks from the excessive amount of greasy sausage.  Now, don't take this the wrong way.  The pizza is to die for and i absolutely love it, just get light sausage and you will thank me later.  I am a big fan of their bruschetta as well so give that a whirl next time you stop by.
