Art Institute of Chicago////Beautiful and well curated museum.  It captures the best of art and what America has to offer.  The price to enter the building is pretty steep but when you come in they definitely showcase the very best.  It was obvious that there is much love given to each and every display.  They pay homage to Chicago with many many artists that have architectural flair.
