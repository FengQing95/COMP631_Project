Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Not worth the wait!  There are many other outstanding steakhouses in the City that have better service.  Waited for months to get a reservation.  Our waitress was pleasant, but as far as "fine dressed", her shirt was hanging out and most of the servers looked sloppy.  My son and daughter-in-law ordered  their largest steak to share.  They did not give her a plate or silverware, although it was clear when ordered that they were going to share.  We had to ask, and they acted as if it was a chore.
