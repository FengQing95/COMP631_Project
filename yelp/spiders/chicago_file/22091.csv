Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They delivered it to our hotel room so we never got the dine in experience. We ordered the traditional deep dish Chicago pizza both times. The cheese was amazing! The butter crust... drooling!!! We also ordered calamari and that wasn't as good but I blame it on delivery. The sauce it came with was yummy. Next time we are in town we will be dinning in.
