Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The atmosphere here is amazing(low lit, flickering candles); its perfect for a romantic night out.   The service we received was nice but a little over bearing.  I don't want someone to refill my water every time I take a sip and interrupt my conversation every few minutes.  I also felt really uncomfortable (not with being at a fancy place-- this girl knows how to dine) but with the staff staring at you the entire time you're dining. It was a bit off putting.
