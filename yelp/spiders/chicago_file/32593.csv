Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I never judge a place on atmosphere (Im all abut the food). That said, this place is cool looking and has a nice vibe.  Drinks are very good as well.  However, the love-fest pretty much ends there.  Service was extremely slow, even for our drinks.  Very inattentive throughout with little personality to offer. As for the food, its started good with the duck terrine and goat cheese app.  Entrees and sides all were good but not one made me think it was a standout dish that I needed to have again and, for a restaurant with this kind of acclaim and price-point, let alone the competition out there, its all too bad.  Fried chicken was tasty but its still fried chicken.  After a few bites you really cant eat much more of it.  The short rib stroganoff was tasty as well but good is just that. I can get "good" all over the city. The steak frites was "good" as well.  Desserts fell in that same category with the whiskey ice cream and choco cream cake.
