Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We both ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic pizza with a side order of three-cheese bread.  No wonder the low carb diet doesn't work for me!  Anyway, Malnati's famous "Buttercrust" did not dissapoint!  It was absolutely delicious!  The sausage was so tasty and the tomato sauce and cheese were just right.  It was the perfect pizza.
