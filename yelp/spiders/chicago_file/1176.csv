Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I have just flown in from California and was craving a really good pancake. I've been used to IHOP's pancakes but was pleasantly impressed with the quality of Wildberry's and can even say that they are better than the ones I am used to. I hope Wildberry branches out to California because I know that I will miss them when I leave Chicago.
