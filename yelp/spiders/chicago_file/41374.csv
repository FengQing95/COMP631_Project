Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I chose this place over Cafe Iberico. Delicious pintxos. I watch a lot of Spanish movies so I've heard of a lot of Spanish foods like pintxos, tapas, gazpacho, paella, but it is my first time trying Spanish food. Â The waitress answered all our questions and we had a lot. My mom and I both sampled a pintxos. I had the goat cheese croqueta pintxo and she had the deviled egg, bacon and mustard. For tapas, I had the rioja-braised short ribs and mashed potatoes. It's a small plate, but very filling and delicious. The meat is very tender and the mashed potatoes have some kind of cheese on it.
