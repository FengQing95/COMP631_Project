Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've heard a lot of good things about Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, so I was excited to see if it was worth the hype! We started out with a pitcher of the black raspberry sangria, which was really refreshing and yummy. We ordered 7 items to share between the 5 of us there, and everything is served tapas style. I would say we ordered the perfect amount of food for our group.
