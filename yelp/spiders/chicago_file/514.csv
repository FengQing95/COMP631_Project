Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Went here for breakfast with a friend this past weekend - the place was packed (Saturday morning) but we didn't have to wait long for a table and the service was speedy. The food was excellent and the portions were just right. I'm a skillet-man myself, I get them wherever I go for breakfast and at Wildberry I had the Mexican skillet and it was excellent, a lot of tasty chorizo and a lot of kick to it which I enjoyed. Definitely recommend this place, great breakfast spot in the city.
