Little Goat Diner////We were seated at our table a bubbly Australian waitress with a lot of tattoos served us, she was great friendly and knew the menu very well.  I asked for a few recommendations she recommended the "goat almighty". It's a $20 goat burger topped with pork, fried onion ring, cheese, and steak.  I was hungry thought I could tackle a hearty burger until I saw it .  This sandwich  was massive, you need a fork and knife.  While it was large it was actually manageable. Flavored were great, spicy, and the goat was not gamy or anything like that.
