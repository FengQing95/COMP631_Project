Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Again the pizza is great, by far my favorite Chicago deep dish. Â I will give you another shot Lou, just hopefully not with the same waiter! The most aggressive part was when the food was delivered and he insisted on cutting and serving the pizza out- he barely gave us time to decide what to eat- it was an intense experience!
