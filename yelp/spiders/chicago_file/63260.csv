Smoque BBQ////The service was good.  The atmosphere is casual barbecue like.  And the food is off the chain good.  The hot food is hot and the cool/cold food is cool/cold.  The cole slaw has a light non mayonnaise dressing so that you can actually taste the slaw.  The ribs come bare and piping hot cooked to perfection with a side of barbecue sauce for those who needs.  I ate them both ways and the ribs were good.  They had a slight smoked flavor but they were tender and flavorful without overpowering the meet.
