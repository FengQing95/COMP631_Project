Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Driving into Chicago from Ann Arbor, all I could think about was having the cheeseburger at Au Cheval.  There's so much hype about it, not to mention being called the best hamburger in America by Bon Appetit!  We arrived for lunch there at 2:50P, not realizing, although it's clearly indicated on the website, that the kitchen closes from 3-5P.  We had to order everything we wanted immediately, including dessert!  There was a bit of pressure to order, but our waitress was still very nice about it.  I ordered the double cheeseburger (3 patties on a double - bonus) and the crispy potatoes with duck heart gravy.  The burger was juicy, sloppy and delicious - everything you hope a burger will be.  I've had plenty of great hamburgers, and it might not be the best in America, but it's certainly very near the top of the list! And the crispy potatoes with duck heart gravy and a perfectly fried egg on top was very rich and comforting.  I almost felt sorry for my friend who ordered the chopped salad with bacon, egg and ranch dressing.  But when the salad appeared with two beautiful strips of bacon criss-crossed over the top of the salad, I would have been in for that, too.  She said the salad was good, but the lettuce appeared to be mostly iceburg.
