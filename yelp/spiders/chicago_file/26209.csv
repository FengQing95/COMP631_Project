Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Being from the Northeast I had reservations about the Chicago style deep dish pizza, but my meal here made me a believer. The ingredients were all of high quality In the crust itself was delicious. Â I still prefer New York style pizza, however if I had a place like this near my home I am sure I would eat their from time to time.
