Little Goat Diner////Yum. I've been here countless times. Brunch, dinner, bar, booth, pastries. I've done it all. I haven't loved everything I've had, but most things are quite good. I especially like to stop and have a drink at the bar. Their bartenders are super friendly and know what they're doing. Favorite food items are the Sloppy Goat, Machos Nachos, and the Mac 'n Cheese. One thing I didn't really care for was the Biscuits and Gravy. I'm tough to please on that front though.
