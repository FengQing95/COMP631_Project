Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I ordered the veal chops and my financee had the fried chicken.  Both of our dishes were cooked to perfection.  I recommend the veal to almost anyone, my financee doesn't like veal and she loved the chops.  Fair warning the fried chicken is not like normal fried chicken.  There is no bone, I believe it was all white meat but breast only and no bones.  So it isn't what you would traditionally think of as fried chicken.  The breading was nice and spicy, check it out!
