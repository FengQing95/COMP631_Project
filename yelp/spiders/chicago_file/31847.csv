Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I went to this location on 10/11 and gave my number for a table. We were seated pretty quickly, and a hostess approached us and remembered us for the table instead of sending another text. Our server was so great. I wish I could remember his name!! Our order came much faster than expected, everything was made perfectly, and we had a great time!!! Thank you! This location was also super clean.
