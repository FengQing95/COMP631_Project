Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////You can never go wrong with a Lou Malnati's deep dish pizza. The Chicago Classic is my favorite with extra cheese, sausage, tomatoes and Â butter-crust. All their food is delicious, from appetizers, salads, entrees and desserts. Their service is very good, with a pleasant staff that is eager to please.
