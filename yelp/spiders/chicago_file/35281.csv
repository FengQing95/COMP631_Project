Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Salad: Wedge salad based off our waiters recommendation. I would go back just for the salad. The star of the salad is bacon and honestly, it's the best bacon I have ever tasted. It's so good we both started laughing when we tried it. If you aren't going to order the bacon on the side, I would order the wedge Salad.
