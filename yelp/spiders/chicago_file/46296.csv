Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The place was crowded and had a very lively (loud) atmosphere.  It probably would be great for a group of friends.  The decor was appropriately Spanish.  I think we were not very hungry, and we ordered two tapas and seafood paella for two.  The tapas were mediocre, and the paella was just poorly made.  One of my neighbors actually is a cook for Cafe BaBaReeba and I went to talk to him (since it was my first time in the restaurant, and I wanted to say hello).  I asked him about the paella.  I commented that the paella was dry to the point that it was as if it were "crunchy."  I asked him whether that if that is the way they normally prepare it or maybe I got a bad preparation.  He said that it was normal, and he doens't know why they do it that way.
