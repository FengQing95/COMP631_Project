Smoque BBQ////Like most chefs, I don't really like chicken, as it is almost never prepared right, but I went nuts and ordered a half BBQ chicken; my fingers and toes crossed, praying to the Lord I don't believe in that they would know how to cook it and what did I receive? Â A succulent, juicy, crispy skinned miracle!
