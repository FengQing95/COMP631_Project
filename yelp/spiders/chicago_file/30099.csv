Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Called in our pizza at 10:00 and told them we would be arriving at 10:30 to grab a table! Got their at 10:30 was seated right away, ordered the bruschetta while we waited for our pizza to cook, the bruschetta was AMAZING! The ingredients were fresh, we devoured this. We ordered a medium half cheese half deep dish. Both sides were very good, I liked the cheese better though!
