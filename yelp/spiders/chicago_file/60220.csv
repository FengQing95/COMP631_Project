Smoque BBQ////I've been a big fan of Smoque ever since it opened, and despite all of the barbecue restaurants that have followed behind, Smoque still is the tastiest with the best service. All of the main dishes are favorites, and the sides -- especially the mac 'n cheese -- are winners. Get there early, because although it's been around for a few years and all of the other imitators mentioned, lines can still be long.
