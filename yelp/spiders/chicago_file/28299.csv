Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Had a 55 minute wait wasn't too bad because it was Â such a nice night. They told us we could order ahead of time before we were seated because pizza takes 30 minutes in the oven. We ordered early and also wanted appetizers but they said we had to wait to order when we sat down for that because they are way faster than the pizza. We're seated about 10-15 minutes after that, ordered our apps waited a good while and the pizza ended up coming before. Wouldn't have ordered the apps if we knew the pizza would come before because none of them compare to the main dish and none of us were hungry for appetizers once we had a slice down but the wait for the pizza was worth it!!! Get the buttercrust pepperoni deep dish! Soo good
