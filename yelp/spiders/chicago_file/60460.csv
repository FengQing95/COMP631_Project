Smoque BBQ////I ordered the 1/2 brisket (sliced) 1/2 pulled pork sandwich and a side of mac and cheese.  The meat is a little hard to describe...it was soooooo tender and yet not mushy.  Super tasty!  The mac and cheese was so good also...I'm glad the portion was modest, as I probably could have eaten a gallon tub of it, no kidding.  The few bites of coleslaw I had I liked, also...very crunchy and not too wet.
