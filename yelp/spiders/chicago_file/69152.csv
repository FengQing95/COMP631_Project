Little Goat Diner////I ordered a Rosemary Daly cocktail and a Korean Burger with goat and split some fries. The fries were great, but the drink didn't taste like a mixed drink at all... it just tasted like sugary lemon water. Not even a hint of rosemary. A big bummer, especially considering it cost $10.
