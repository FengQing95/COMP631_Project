Little Goat Diner////Amazing that a chef's rep is all it takes. I don't quite understand all the accolades here. Two words come to mind. Overrated and Overpriced. Jammed for lunch on a Thursday. Had reservations and was seated immediately. I took the servers suggestion and ordered the white fish tostada. Flavorful, but disappointing. Basically several bites of fish and some slaw. Ordered the chunk of bread. $4 for 4 slices. It was good and I liked the toppings but just can't get used to paying for bread. To get in the diner mode, I also ordered a chocolate malt shake. It was good but not $8 good. Also I would avoid for a business lunch as it's loud. I really wanted to like the Little Goat, but I see no reason to come back with so many other options in town.
