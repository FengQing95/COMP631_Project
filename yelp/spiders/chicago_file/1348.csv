Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Visiting Chicago for a couple of days downtown, and saw this highly reviewed on Yelp so decided to give it a try. At 9:00 on a Thursday morning, the line was out the door, but was told a 15 minute wait, which seemed reasonable (I can only imagine what it's like at a peak time!). Once inside, my waitress was terrific, EVERY plate coming to neighboring tables looked great, and my only dilemma was what to order off their huge menu. After talking with my waitress, decided to go for the Berry Bliss French toast, and was it absolutely fantastic!! Moist, fresh, sweet, coffee replenished several times despite the crowd...words like awesome and amazing are certainly overused, but this time they fit. Expect to wait a bit, but if you are a fan of great breakfasts, just go!
