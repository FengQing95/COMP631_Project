Art Institute of Chicago////I have been here several times since I moved to Chicago. Every time I have a visitor or there is a free day I go. Usually it so busy that you have to walk through the exhibits pretty quickly. This day, I was able to take my time and honestly I did not like what I saw. Of course the exhibits are beautiful, but at times it was hard to appreciate their beauty when there was a layer of filth and dust on everything. The most embarrassing moment was when we walked by a vent upstairs and a whole layer of dust came off of it and created a huge, grey dust bunny in the hallway. We called an employee to see it and they seemed to shrug it off. I would have immediately called someone to clean it up! Next time you are here, you will see what I mean. How embarrassing for the museum and for Chicago!
