Little Goat Diner////One of my favorite spots on Randolph. The decor is upscale diner and the food is off the charts. I've been to Girl and the Goat which is obviously also amazing, but this offers a slightly less expensive option to experience Stephanie Izard's masterpieces. I pretty much always get the Reuben when I go here as it's one of the best I've ever had.
