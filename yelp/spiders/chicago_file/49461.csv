Smoque BBQ////I had  the sliced brisket platter with black beans, mac & cheese, and fries.  The black beans were OK.  I found the mac & cheese to be fairly ordinary (didn't like the crumb topping, though).  The fries were good, but I can get better fries at Susie's about a mile away.  Cole slaw was underdressed, which I liked.  Cornbread was forgettable.
