Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Drinks top notch, decor, service and food first class all around.  Even though known for steak, we wanted to try something different on the menu. My wife ordered the roasted chicken and the baked sweet potato  as her side. Sounds boring right? Not in the least! Close to the best chicken around- seasoned perfectly to golden brown and not one piece was dry.  The sweet potato is also highly recommended.  I ordered the short rib stroganoff.  Downright delicious and worth every bite.  Used the bread to scrape up the remaining velvety sauce on the plate.  Come hungry to this place so you can fit as much as possible. Not pretentious either, which is a big bonus in my book.
