Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////We were referred to this place by our hotel. The wait said 25 minutes which turned to 10. Plenty of people waiting to eat there. The service from everyone in the restaurant was amazing! The food was probably top 2 that I've ever had and I love food. Had the los altos eggs benedict and my wife had the florence. Signature Bliss pancakes were also amazing! Must eat in Chicago! Simply Amazing!
