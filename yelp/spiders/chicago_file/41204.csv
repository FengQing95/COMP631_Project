Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This meal was one of the best I've ever had. I went in a little hesitant about trying Tapas but to my surprise it was a great meal! Everything had so much flavor and it all tasted so fresh. I loved everything I tasted. Our waiter was really attentive and our food came out two plates at a time which was a perfect pace. I live right by this place so I will definitely be back for more!
