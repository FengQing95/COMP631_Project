Little Goat Diner////Visit #3 - Brought the wife and the half breeds.  Brandade and Belly this time.  Not great.  Just cause you put some Korean related things on the menu to "spice" things up doesn't make it good.  I've had kimchee with everything in my life, and this wasn't in the try again list.  C'mon Izard, you are killing me.  I wanted to try the Korean breakfast thing, but then I remembered that I grew up eating Korean breakfast...which is basically the same as Korean lunch and dinner...you just eat it at 7 AM instead of 12 PM or 7 PM.
