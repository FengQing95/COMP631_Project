Little Goat Diner////Okay, so I finally made it into the Little Goat for a late lunch. A friend and I decided to come her and it sadly it's not super easy to get to via public trans, but we made it there nonetheless. There was a 75-90 minute wait at 3pm on a Sunday. I suppose it is a Sunday, but that's quite a long wait for mid afternoon to Â me. I guess that's what happens when you go to a Stephanie Izard restaurant (Girl and the Goat tends to be hard to get reservations for unless you schedule way out).
