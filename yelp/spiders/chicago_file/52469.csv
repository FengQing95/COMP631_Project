Smoque BBQ////Amazing BBQ--the best I have had in Chicago, hands down! The meats are expertly smoked (have tried pork and beef brisket) and the peach-cobbler is out of this world delicious (and I'm usually not a big peach cobbler person).  I cannot properly stress how good the peach cobbler is.  The cole-slaw is just-right, the fries are excellent, the beans are actually incredible (what is in them??).  I actually haven't had the mac and cheese because the portions are so small (my only complaint about this place) but I hear it is delicious nonetheless.  I wish I lived closer or it was more convenient for me to get here and if that was the case I would come here at least once a week.
