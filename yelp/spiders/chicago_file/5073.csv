The Purple Pig////This restaurant is outstanding!! The service is good. The food is excellent. I had the squid ink pasta that was spicy, yummy and excellent. It was perfectly balanced with a glass of the Janis Picpoul. My husband Â had the pork shoulder which was melt in your mouth . The appetizer was excellent - The bufala mozzarella and for desert bread pudding. Everything was spectacular. We be back next time we are in Chicago
