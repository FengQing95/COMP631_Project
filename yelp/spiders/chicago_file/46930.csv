Smoque BBQ////Gotta Tell You How Impressed I am With Smoque. Prior To The Last Time We Ordered Always Get The Brisket, It Was Dry ANd Not Tender. Called To Order Dinner Last Night And Explained About The Food Last Two Times. My Girlfriend Picked Up Same Dinner And It was Excellent.And On Top Off That Did Not Charge Us For 1 Other Dinner. This Is How A Business Is Run And I Give The HIghest Compiment To Them. We Will Always Be Back Thank You Again For Exceptional Food And Service
