Little Goat Diner////Awww...Little Goat. I like it here.  I like the "give us your phone number and we'll text you when your table is ready"...I liked the big roomy booth with the distressed leather...I loved the menu.  We asked our waitress what her favorites were and she gave us some amazing choices - the french toast, the goat chili, the choco taco sundae.
