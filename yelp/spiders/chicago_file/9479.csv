Art Institute of Chicago////There are many famous, iconic pieces here - Grant Wood's American Gothic, Chagall's American Windows, Magritte's Time Transfixed, Edward Hopper's Nighthawks, Dali's Venus de Milo with Drawers, Picasso's The Old Guitarist, and many more to enjoy! I must say that Nighthawks was my favorite - this painting just "speaks" to me, and I love it every time I see it or a reproduction.
