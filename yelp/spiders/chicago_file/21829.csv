Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As a native New Jerseyan, and frequenter of NYC, I feel confident in my knowledge of proper pizza. That being said, Lou Malnati's was the absolute worst pizza I've ever had in my entire life. That honor used to belong to the Little Italy section of Cleveland. I have no idea where these positive reviewers are from, but they clearly don't know pizza. Don't waste my time with "But it's Chicago style." No. Just no. I was given a plate of crust with a cheese and sauce swamp on top of it. To top it off, it had no taste whatsoever. This putrid pie was complimented by tremendously slow service. I occasionally wake up in the middle of the night with PTSD episodes of this horrible horrible pizza.
