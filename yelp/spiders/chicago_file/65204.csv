Smoque BBQ////So hungry and excited to try one of the most popular restaurants in Chicago, my friends and I stopped here for lunch and drinks. It's BYOB so we brought a few bottles of Stella to accompany our ribs. Between 4 people, we shared 2 racks of ribs, a platter of beef brisket, and a platter of pulled pork + sides (mac & cheese, fries, and a salad. Total was $50ish. The food came out pretty fast and we digged in (after a few pictures for social medias).
