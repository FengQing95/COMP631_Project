Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For appetizers, we started off with the Peppered Duck & Goat Cheese Terrine, which I thought was life-changing. A year or two ago, I would have never ordered anything remotely close to this, but I put my trust in our server, Erik, and couldn't be more glad I did! It was creamy, rich, cheese-y and altogether freaking marvelous!
