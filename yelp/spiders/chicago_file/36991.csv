Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the service. I've been there twice, both experiences being completely different mainly because of the server. First time I went, the server was great. Attentive, knowledgeable about the menu, friendly - everything you'd expect. Can't say the same about our second experience. Our waitress was abrasive and barely came to our table, which was weird because she seemed so attentive with other tables with older patrons. I assume that a table with a young couple wasn't worth it to her. I ordered the whiskey ice cream for dessert but it was clearly tasted like vanilla. After a little arguing, she finally agreed to bring me the whiskey, but not without a few eye rolls. Worst part was that one of the waiters spilled wine all over my boyfriend. The waitress apologized but was almost annoyed by having to apologize for it. Given that it's a nice restaurant, we were half expecting to a least be comped for the wine, but nothing. It's a shame about the service cause the food really is delicious and always on point.
