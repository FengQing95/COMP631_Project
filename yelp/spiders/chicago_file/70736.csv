Little Goat Diner////We ordered the cheeseburger, fries, fish tostadas and the burrito. The cheeseburger was cooked a perfect medium, the lettuce and tomato were fresh. The fish tostadas could have been better -- it had a nice crisp shell and the battered shrimp was somewhat unseasoned.... it was OK. The burrito was excellent, even though it didn't really look like a burrito at all. I was intrigued by the fried pickle sandwich, but I had to pull a Chris Rock when I saw it was $10... "Ten dollahs? Good lawd thats a whole lotta money!", in which the waitress replied, its the cheapest sammich on the menu. Hmm, true.
