Little Goat Diner////I finally got to try Little Goat! Yay! I made reservations to ensure we had a table without having to wait like everyone else *cough suckers cough*.  Our waitress was very friendly and helpful with the menu since it was my friend's and my first time here.  I couldn't decide between the breakfast menu and the sammiches since who doesn't love breakfast foods for dinner?  I ended up ordering the Los Drowned and my friend had the Sloppy Goat.  I really liked my sammich and would order it again even though it's nothing exotic.  Los Drowned had braised beef with Havarti, avocado, pickled peppers and onions, and spicy mayo (wasn't spicy fyi) on a hoagie.  The braised beef was so tender and juicy it just melted in your mouth, and the pickled peppers and onions added a nice crisp contrast that was refreshing.  I probably should have known from the name "Los Drowned" that the sandwich would be messy but it didn't click in my head..whoops.  Both sandwiches are super messy so if you're planning on having a first date here, make sure your date doesn't scare easily or order something you can eat with a fork and knife (it may also be that I'm not a proper lady and can't eat without getting messy...which most likely is the case).  We also split a side of the smoked fries which were awesome!  The pieces were really small, kind of like odds and ends which was disappointing but the flavor itself was great.  They tasted like BBQ chips but in the form of fries.
