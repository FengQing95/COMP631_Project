Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our experience at Bavette's was wonderful. We arrived this past Saturday for our 6:30 reservation and we actually found street parking right in front of the restaurant, that was a good sign that we were going to have a great night. We were seated promptly and were attended immediately. For our appetizer we ordered the garlic shrimp which were wonderful. After the bread and the shrimp my husband and I were already getting full but very excited for entrees. I ordered the traditional filet mignon with the baked potato (which was enormous) and he ordered the classic ribeye. We were both gushing over how incredible everything tasted. I added the roasted garlic sauce and every bite was sensational. The reason I did not rate the restaurant 5 stars was because our waitress was a bit slow towards the end. She got pretty swamped with the bar it seemed like she rarely check up on us anymore. I asked for the drink list once we had our entrees and she brought it to me right away but took a while before coming back to see if I wanted to order the drink. Once I did order my husband was going to ask for something as well but once I told her what I wanted she just ran off and didn't even bother to ask him if he would like to place a drink order. Other than that this place was wonderful. We had the lemon meringue pie as dessert and left there very, very happy. I would highly recommend this place to anyone.
