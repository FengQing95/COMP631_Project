Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've been a couple of times and it's pretty good. Love the filling; they lay out the sausage in a thick layer and smother it in cheese. A lot of people say they come for their special buttery crust, but I actually am not as big of a fan as I had hoped. I prefer a bit more flakiness than a crispy, cornbread type crust.
