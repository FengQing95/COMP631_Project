Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I love Lou's!  When I lived out of state for six years, I missed Lou's Pizza the most, but thankfully it can be ordered and shipped to anywhere FedEx delivers too!  Now that I am back in Chicago, it is my go to pizza place and when we have guests in from out of town, we always introduce them to Lou's so they can taste true Chicago-style pizza.  Thank you Lou's for always being the best!!
