Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered the The Malnati Chicago Classic with pepperoni on top. The crust actually resembles some type of pie crust. Right above it is sauce and sausage. Its much different than I thought as the sausage is one large piece the same diameter of the pizza. Above that is the traditional toppings of cheese, sauce, and pepperoni. It was pretty amazing, but after two slices it was hard to eat more. The amount of sausage is what kind of threw me off. I would have preferred less as the ratio from meat to cheese, sauce, and crust was just not right. The food quality was great, but it was not 5 stars for me.
