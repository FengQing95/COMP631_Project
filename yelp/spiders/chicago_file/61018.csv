Smoque BBQ////Finally a place that lives up to the hype! This was a last-minute dinner decision, and I was really surprised to find the place packed, and I mean PACKED, on a Thursday night. We pretty much had to wait out the door, but surprisingly things kept moving. 30 minutes, and many edited dinner options later, I finally decided to go with the Brisket Platter with the BBQ Beans and Peach Cobbler. Holy yum. Full of flavor and delicious-highly recommend.
