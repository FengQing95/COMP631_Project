Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's is my favorite Chicago style pizza and this my favorite location.  The staff is friendly and service is fast.  Understand that a Chicago pizza takes about 45 minutes to cook so pre-order if their is a wait to be seated or order and appetizer if you are hungry.  Go for the pepperoni, it a classic and the best pizza they make.
