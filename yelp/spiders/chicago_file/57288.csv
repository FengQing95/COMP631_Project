Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I came with one of my girlfriends to do some restaurant week shenanigans. We made a reservation for 4:30 on a Saturday and thank goodness we did...the dinner rush soon hit it's peak after we were seated. I appreciate the front desk workers for honoring the reservation even though parking was a nightmare, which caused us to be 20 minutes late. The only reason I took off a star is because there was a very long wait between courses, but I don't even really want to take a full star of because it was busybusybusy. Our waitress was the bomb, and even though our food was taking a while and she was running around doing tons of other things, she was extremely pleasant and on top of making sure we got everything we ordered. The way they work in there is like an extremely organized chaotic dance. You have the guys balancing 294929494 different sized plates on a single tray....one-handed....holding it over their heads and carrying them away every 5 minutes (meanwhile I can barely walk and talk at the same time), the servers who are rushing around with various orders without bumping into anything, just particularily great service that specific night from what I noticed. The food was all great. I could go on and on about each dish we had, but I'm still recovering from the food coma, so I'll just include some pictures and give you my word on how good it all was.
