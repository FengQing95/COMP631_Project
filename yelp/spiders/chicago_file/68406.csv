Little Goat Diner////This is really a 4.5 star review. I really liked Little Goat, we went for dinner but ordered lunch type stuff mostly. The bread of the day was Bacon Gouda and was super good. We got a grilled cheese sandwich that was pretty good, but a little heavy on one particular flavor. Also got a Los Drowned, which is like a french dip sandwich but with a bunch of extra stuff on it. It was very very good, if a huge mess to eat. We got two desserts, Choco Taco and a Blueberry Pie milkshake. Both of those were fantastic too. The service was very good, and the place is done very cooly. Sort of a swanky hipster version of an old american diner. My only complaint about the environment might be that it was very loud on a Sunday night, we pretty much had to shout to hear each other across the table. We will definitely be back, because their breakfast/brunch menu looked really interesting too, and they have some cocktails and beers that seem worth trying too. Great place, at a very reasonable price, and you can actually sometimes get a table without selling off a child or favorite pet. We'll definitely be back here.
