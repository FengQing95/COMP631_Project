Smoque BBQ////Wow, Smoque was jumping on the evening we went. The line was almost out the door on our arrival and went out the door shortly after. For this venture we ordered the sliced brisket, texas sausage, rib combo (1/2 baby back, 1/2 St. Louis), mac and cheese, fresh cut fries, cornbread, and the pecan bread pudding.
