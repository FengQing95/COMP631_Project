Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We also had some other items. These dishes had more subtle flavors, which were partially lost on me because my cold muted the flavors. Anyway: from the Hors d'Oeuvres, we got the Fois Gras. The combination with blackberry was quite interesting. From the sides, we got the pommes frites and the wild mushrooms. The pommes frites with the garlic (truffle?) aioli are one of my favorite Chicago staples. The wild mushrooms came in a surprising variety. We also had the crab-stuffed avocado, which was, like all the other dishes, very good.
