Smoque BBQ////The St Louis ribs were perfect and moist with the meat barely hanging on to the bone. I opted for the brisket over the pulled pork and I couldn't have been happier with my decision. Like the ribs, the brisket was equally as succulent and tender. The meat coupled with the savory Memphis style BBQ sauce was simply perfection on a platter.
