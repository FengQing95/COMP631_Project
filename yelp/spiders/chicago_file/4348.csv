The Purple Pig////This was also another restaurant I was highly interested trying. Party of 2 on a Thursday night, wait was about 90 minutes. This place is very tight, particularly inside. We were seated right in front of the cooks where they prepare their food, so it was a nice view the whole time. They have a very extensive menu so it can be difficult to decide. Fortunately, our server was incredibly helpful.
