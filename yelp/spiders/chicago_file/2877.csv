The Purple Pig////You know that meme where that guy is salting his food? Well, I imagine it was like that in the kitchen yesterday x5. Last time I came here was over 2 years ago and it was delicious. My cousin wanted to try this Chicago staple so we went here with a group of 4 yesterday evening. The consensus was unanimous. Our palate are on the saltier side and 4 out of 6 dishes here were overly salty or tarty.  For being a michelin "bib gourmand," the restaurant does not live up to expectation. As some reviews have noted on here, consistency is probably an issue.
