Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of my favorite places in Chicago! Delicious assortment of tapas for a really good price and amazing sangria! Some of my favorite dishes are the Â cheese stuffed mushrooms, the paella, and the roasted goat cheese. The service has always been pretty good when I have been here and it is a really great place to take a large group because of the sharing style plates and variety on the menu. Make sure to call and reserve it is usually pretty busy.
