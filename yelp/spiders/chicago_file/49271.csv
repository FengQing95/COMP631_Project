Smoque BBQ////Just OK BBQ....I was not impressed with the meat or the sauce but I tried it because of all the hype received in the reviews. The ribs were the best thing on the menu. The brisket and pulled pork lacked seasoning and while the pulled pork also lacked moisture. I give it three stars because the service was excellent but the food still leaves a lot to be desired.
