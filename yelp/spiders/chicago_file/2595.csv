The Purple Pig////Food: OMG, these are the places that make me wish for a dining companion because there were SO many crave-worthy dishes coming out of the kitchen. I started with the cauliflower dish ($9)- generous serving, perfectly grilled and tossed with cornichons, parley, and just the right amount of salt and lemon. Perfect textures, brilliant flavors, this dish was genius! For round two, I took my new bff server's suggestion and ordered the octopus ($17). I can see why this is a staff fave. The octo tentacles were huge, tender, flavorful. It came with charred green beans and tiny potatoes. Another winner!
