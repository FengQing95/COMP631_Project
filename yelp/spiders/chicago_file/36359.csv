Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For our mains, I opted for the Short Rib Stroganoff and my fiancé went with the Filet Mignon Petite Duchess Cut.  The stroganoff was amazingly rich and creamy with chunks of short rib that just melted in my mouth.  I would order this again, and again, and again!  Mike's filet...serious perfection.  The thick cut of meat was a perfect medium rare all the way through.  I don't even know how you go about cooking such a thick cut like that!
