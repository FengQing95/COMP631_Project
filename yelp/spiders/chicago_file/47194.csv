Smoque BBQ////I used to work in the restaurant business for 9 years and I have eaten here at least a dozen times, and have never had less than a five star food experience. It makes me irritated to read reviews where people are searching for something to criticize in this place. I understand BBQ is a very subjective experience, but nothing these guys do is mediocre. If their biggest sin is long lines, I can live with that. This place uses quality ingredients in everything they make. All of their sides a truly homemade from scratch-no food service prepared product here. Real mac-n-cheese (crusty on top), homemade cornbread, beans from heaven, crisp vinaigrette coleslaw,  peach cobbler is amazing.  In my opinion, their prices are too low for what they do with food.  Let's hope they can keep up these high standards of food production. These guys could have sold out long ago, but have stayed true to their high standards of quality! Keep up the great work!!!
