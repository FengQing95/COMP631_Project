Art Institute of Chicago////In an attempt to save some money, we considered our options for our long weekend in Chicago, and pre-purchased our admissions to the Art Institute of Chicago through the Chicago Go Card - you either need a printer, or to download their app to use it though.  With two or more attractions you get at least a 20% discount.  You do, however, have to let go of the freedom to make your decisions on the fly, and to commit to the activities to actualize the cash benefit.
