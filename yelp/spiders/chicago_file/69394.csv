Little Goat Diner////This place oozes "Chicago".. Intended to meet family here for dinner, but last minute changes ended with me riding solo. I got a bar seat and ordered the biscuits and gravy, with a side of hash browns.. In short, I came in hungry and left with half my food uneaten. The biscuits and Â gravy were oddly sugary and the hash browns just did not taste right. However, I was at the bar next to the order kiosk and was able to see first hand how they handle food and the orders, and at that vantage it kind of makes you feel like you are apart of the staff. The place is ran like a navy ship. I saw so much food go out that I wanted to taste.. I may have just ordered the wrong thing (for me) and will be giving this place a second chance when I find the opportunity.
