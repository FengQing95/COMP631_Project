Little Goat Diner////The place is perfect for groups because of the sheer size of the dining room, just be sure to gauge your timing so you aren't showing up with 8 people at top traffic time. They also have a little bakery/bar next door that's great for waiting and drinking good beer if you happen to get stuck at dinner rush hour. Get drunk, and all of sudden your table is ready. Yeehaw!
