Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I went to Bavette's with my boyfriend to celebrate our anniversary, and it was a great experience! I had made the reservation way in advance (like several months) which I've heard is necessary for this place, and it showed. We went on a Wednesday night and it was full to capacity.
