Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So i never had real deep dish before coming here and I wasn't disappointed. The wait wasn't bad at all and we were lucky to sit at the bar while we waited for our table. But there was a group of ladies standing behind us who would not stop complaining. They were saying the bartender was ignoring them but they only been standing there for like 5 mins...In a fully packed restaurant... Really?!? They ended up tipping him like a dollar so we gave him extra tip..
