Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm from San Francisco and was excited to finally get to try authentic Deep Dish Pizza in Chicago! I only have Little Star, Patxi's, Chicago Fire (Sac Town) and BJ's to compare to. After contemplating between Pequod's and Lou's, I decided to go with Lou's since I have a friend who went there in October and recommended it highly.
