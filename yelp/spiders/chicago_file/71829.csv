Little Goat Diner////Food: GET the NACHOS to share.. You won't regret it and I mean business when it comes to my Mexican food. I would come back for that and the lattes alone. Super fresh chips and generous toppings. Had the Bulls eye French Toast which I wish I had gotten the sauce on the side to lighten it a bit after filling up on the nachos. The egg in the center was a pleasant surprise to see gush out as I reached the center of the toast. Fried chicken wasn't bad but I miss the bone-in style moist fried chicken that comes with other breakfast options elsewhere as I was hoping for a chicken and waffles type meal. Overall still too sweet for me but I am a savory brunch dish person I am learning. Hash browns were great as a fresh delicious side too (prepared with cheese.. Can't go wrong there right?!) Sausage side was also amazing. Loved the house made hot sauces (chipotle and the spicier habanero option were both good!).
