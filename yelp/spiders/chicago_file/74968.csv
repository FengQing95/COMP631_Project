Little Goat Diner////--- Here's where the problem lies. I've always said the Mac & Cheese orrrr Mashed Potatoes could either make or break a meal. This one didn't break it, mainly because I didn't even finish it all. Fortunately the burger was just so extreme that the Mac & Cheese was almost irrelevant. But I never forget. It was white cheddar cheese with some crispy breading on top? I'm not really sure but it wasn't great.
