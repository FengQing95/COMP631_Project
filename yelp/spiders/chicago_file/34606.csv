Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We picked the garlic shrimp for starters and all i can say about this delightful little appetizer is "yum!"  It's a bit juvenile but the shrimp were perfect.  Second Old Fashioned and we asked Ben for his favorites on the menu, as far as appetizers went.  He suggested the peppered duck and goat cheese terrine and the Main Lobster.  We went with the lobster but I will be back for that goat cheese goodness.
