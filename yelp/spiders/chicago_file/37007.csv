Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Being my first time in Chicago and with so many steakhouses to choose from, I am beyond happy that I chose to go with Bavettes! The ambiance of this restaurant has a true chicago speakeasy feel to it. Absolutely breathtaking once you walk in, I was so mesmerized! We got seated downstairs which feels more intimate than upstairs and the noise level is a tad bit lower, which is what I prefer anyways. For cocktails I ordered cognac sazerac which was literally a straight neat cognac drink. So if you like taking shots of henny like me, this drink is the one you want to order! For starters we had the smoked salmon caesar salad, main entree we shared the ribeye chicago cut with maitre d' butter cooked medium rare and for sides we had the wild mushrooms and butter mash potatoes. The steak was cooked to absolute perfect perfection with a nice crust on the outside. The butter on top was literally the icing on the cake. The flavor of the sides were perfect as well, although the wild mushrooms were just a tab bit too salty, but you just cant stop eating it! Service was top notch and our waitress was very knowledgable about everything on the menu and about the restaurant itself. We asked if they will ever be expanding to the west coast area, specifically So Cal, but she stated they have one in Las Vegas and So Cal should be the next destination. The owner of Bavettes is also owners to many different kinds restaurants and lounges. We also celebrated a birthday last night, but the dessert was not complimentary, but no biggie. Love this place regardless!
