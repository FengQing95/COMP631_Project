Smoque BBQ////Some old man in a Smoques shirt came up to me and asked me "Can I help you with something???" but his tone was more like I was causing a problem and not because he wanted to "help me" and all I was doing was standing up at the counter waiting for my side dish. (hmm do I look like a troublemaker?...ok dont answer that hehe)
