Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The atmosphere is cozy as you enter. If there is a wait, the bar is nice and there is a comfortable couch and chairs. Once seated, the wait staff was attentive without being hovering. The two cocktails we had were really unique and tasty. While enjoying these, we were served the best warm sour dough bread ever. Had to stop myself. We ordered the burgers and are really glad we did. Mine was with the think cut bacon which was actually a half inch slab of bacon in top of truly scrumptious beef. The fries and side of charred broccoli were done perfectly. An amazing meal and experience for our anniversary dinner. Thank you Bavettes.
