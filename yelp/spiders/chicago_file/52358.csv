Smoque BBQ////We had a a full rack of ribs, the pulled pork sandwich and the chopped brisket sandwich.  Everything was delicious.  My kids picked the ribs to the bone and my wife and i swapped sandwiches.  The side dishes were good too.  Everyone commented how tasy the fries were and the kids could not get enough of the peach cobbler.
