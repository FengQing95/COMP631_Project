Little Goat Diner////The shrimp sandwich is pretty awesome.  I like to think of it as a shrimp taco on a super tasty potato bun.  It's got a fried tortilla the size of the bun, avocado, pickles, pickled slaw, and a shrimp salad.  I think the bun is a little too much and it may be better if there was actually less bread so the ratio of filling to bread was a little more even.  But even so, it was lovely.
