Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food was hearty and soulful.  As a caesar salad aficionado who believes that there isn't much you can do to improve them, the whitefish caesar was exceptional - the whitefish slivers and snowy drift of delicate parmesan cheese created a savory masterpiece.  My husband and I both enjoyed their steak frites, and is there anything better than bearnaise on a fall evening?
