Art Institute of Chicago////Besides the Met, this is my favorite art museum in the whole country. I could spend days in here. The collection is absolutely wonderful. Just being in here make you feel creative and appreciative of all the great artistic minds that have lived on this planet. I wish Los Angeles has a museum at this scale that I could spend a weekend in every month.
