Smoque BBQ////I was really excited to make my first trip to Smoque after reading all the accolades it's received. I was concerned about how long the wait would be on a Friday so I got there around 6:15 with two of my friends. Fortunately, the restaurant was only 50% full! When you walk in you let the guy know how many people you have if you're eating in and he'll tell you which table is yours. Next, you order your food at the counter and you get a number which they'll call out when your food is done.
