Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////We were sat within a few minutes. The hubs ordered a chorizo and egg skillet. Not unlike what he would normally eat anyway. That was delicious. I was torn between the fig, scallion, bacon, havarti omelet and the one with sundried tomatoes with basil and feta. The waitress suggested the fig and so I did. With egg whites. I got the tiramisu pancakes as a side. Within 2 minutes of biting into our food my daughter projectile vomited and I rushed her to the restroom while the hubs got our check. Hahahaha. When couple of bites we did have were great. The sweet and savory omelet was huge. The hash browns were simple but delicious. Butter and salt make anything taste amazing. Â The portions were huge and I ate my dish for lunch and dinner that night. The tiramisu pancake didn't have that coffee taste that I enjoy but it did have the mascarpone. Much more dense than the fluffy cheese in an actual tiramisu.
