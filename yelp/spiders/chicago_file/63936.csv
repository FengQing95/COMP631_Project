Smoque BBQ////Cons - my biggest con was the the brisket was over cooked.  It was just falling apart if you touched it.  Also it had zero smoke ring on it and there was hardly any bark on my slices.  Also, not a fan of the cole slaw.  But then again that's totally cause I prefer mayo based coleslaw instead of a vinegar based one.
