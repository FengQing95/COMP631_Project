Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My siblings and I went for dinner after my sister strongly recommended it as one of her favorite steak houses. As soon as you walk in, you're surrounded with dark wooden walls, chandeliers and big leather chairs. We had reservations for 830 pm but we got there at 730 pm thinking we'd wait but we were seated immediately. Staff was nice, attentive to us and to the tiny details of our needs and they made excellent recommendations.
