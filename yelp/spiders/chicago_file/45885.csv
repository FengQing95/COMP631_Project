Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went here for my birthday this past weekend and the food was good however the drinks were horrible. My party ordered a mojito, the smoke & spice, gin & tonic and a sangria. We also order the seafood paella and the pork paella. I would not say they were the best I have ever had but they were decent. Space is definitely an issue here, I was with a party of 7 and we had to constantly move our chairs around because the waiters kept bumping the back of our chairs or the back of our heads. I don't think anyone from the party would suggest this place to friends or be back.
