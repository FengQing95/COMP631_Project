Art Institute of Chicago////Even if you just browse through everything, 3 hours is not enough. We can here a few hours before closing and thought we had enough time to see everything since we weren't museum people and found that it was just barely enough time to see everything. We mostly got caught up in the miniature collection downstairs which was my favorite.
