Art Institute of Chicago////Anyway, plan to stay here for at least a half day because the Art Institute is full of treasures to be seen! Regardless of how long you intend to stay, you should try to come as soon as it opens and go immediately to the French Impressionism rooms because these rooms will be always full later in the day while the rest of the museum stays relatively calm.
