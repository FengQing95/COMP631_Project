Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered online for 2 pizza to be shipped.  I ordered on a Saturday at 3 pm.  I didn't get my pizza until Wednesday at 7p.m and didn't get to eat until Thursday. I read all the reviews and couldn't wait to get to taste what all the hype was about.  I rushed home from work Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday looking for the cute checkered box outside my door.  Well, it did come but but my anticipation had waned. For what i paid for the pizza....66 dollars i would have expected it to have been delivered in a more timely fashion.  Will i order again? Maybe....but never on a Saturday!!!!!
