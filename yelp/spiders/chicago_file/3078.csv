The Purple Pig////We decided (or the BF decided) on 3 cheeses to split. I chose the two tapas we would be sharing. We went with the Uni Toast and the Duck Liver Pate - all cold tapas! I think I thoroughly enjoyed all three of our dishes - but the Uni Toast was probably my favorite. It didn't have actual uni on it, rather a uni spread. It was light, refreshing, and just the right amount of briny.
