Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I got the personal sized Pan Pizza thinking it would be the same as the full size except for the size. Disappointingly it is made in a smaller pan with shallower sides that all but eliminated the deep dish one orders this pizza for. That could be improved - but the flavor in the pizza I received was spot on. No corn meal crust - perhaps this is just a Giordano's thing.
