Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////If you are visiting downtown Chicago area, this place is a must for dinner. The restaurant is setup like an old fashion steakhouse, but nothing old fashion about the food. Service was phenomenal! First we tried the oysters which were delicious. Then we indulged in the strip with bone marrow on top. Our sides were the Mac and cheese, elote style corn, and the brussel sprouts (which ended up being my favorite thing to eat on the table). We were too full to order dessert, but if I had room I would of tried the carrot cake. Also, they have a great selection of cocktails, with different styles of the classic old fashion. Would love to grab dinner here again if I am ever back in town.
