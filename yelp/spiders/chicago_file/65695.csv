Smoque BBQ////Delicious as always! I had the half slab rib dinner - St. Louis style (baby back also available for the same price). It came with cole slaw and two sides. I chose baked beans, which had chunks of brisket in it, and fries, which were coated in a barbecue spice rub. I finished everything except the fries - I always forget how many they give you.
