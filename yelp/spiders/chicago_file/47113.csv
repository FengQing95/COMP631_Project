Smoque BBQ////MMMMMMM!!  There's a reason why this place is famous.  After seeing it on "Diners, Drive Inns and Dives" we yelped it.  After reading all the good review we decided it's a must try.  So we went there at 3pm on a Saturday.  The place wasn't as crowded as I expected (yelp said this was the best time to come).  I got the brisket platter with fries and corn bread.  The bf got the pulled pork dinner with the mac n' cheese and baked beans.  We also ordered a 1/4 slab of ribs.  We wanted to try everything.  Everything was excellent.  It's byob so we brought a six pack which went great with the Southern style BarBQ.  The ribs had a great dry rub and fell off the bone.  I've never had brisket and pork this soft.  The beans had a great flavor and the baked mac n cheese with breadcrumb topping was excellent.  Fries were great and came in a big bag.  I'd suggest trying everything when you go here, you can get small orders of all the main entrees.  Our total bill was $26 which I thought was really reasonable for the quality and amount of food.  The staff was nice even though they were extremely busy.  Definitely a hidden gem worth checking out.
