Little Goat Diner////Simply delicious. After waiting for 45 minutes we were seated at the bar, and were promptly served coffee. Everything on the breakfast menu looked fantastic, but the omelet and corned beef hash won. The omelet had great textures and flavors, and for a non deli the corned beef hash was tasty. My favorite was the Stumptown coffee that was served, what a surprise when I realized they had it in Chicago! I would definitely go back. The prices were not absurd for the quality of the food, and it is a fun place to people watch.
