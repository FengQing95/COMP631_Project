Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We came here for my birthday and our server acknowledged it. She was amazing throughout the night and had some great recommendations. We started with the oysters which were super fresh and I typically won't eat them anywhere other than on a coast where they're shucked right then and there. Went with the filet which was prepared perfectly. The hubs also enjoyed every bit of his meal.
