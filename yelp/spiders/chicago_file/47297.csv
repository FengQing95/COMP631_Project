Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is great with a group. Very reasonable prices, especially spread over people, and the awesome server staff never hurries you out of your seat. The classic sangria is worth a full pitcher. Also recommend the bacon wrapped dates, seafood paella, and patatas bravas. If you check in on Yelp, you can also usually get a free dessert or side-- per person who checks in!
