Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The environment and the service are really good, severs are very polite and sweet. It is all small plate tapa, some such as beef and seafood are very yummy. I came especially for paella, the paella here is not as good as I expect, it taste a little undercook. But overall, it is a good restaurant.
