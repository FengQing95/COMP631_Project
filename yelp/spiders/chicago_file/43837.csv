Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I met up with some friends here on a Saturday night at 730pm.  It was very crowded, we didn't have a reservation, and we were told it would be an hour.  We waited near the bar for over an hour, and continually was told it would be another 15 minutes.  This went on until 945 when we were finally seated.  So yes, we waited for over 2 hours.  You may be wondering why I am giving 4 stars, but I will get there in a minute...
