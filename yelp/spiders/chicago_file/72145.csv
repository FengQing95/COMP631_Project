Little Goat Diner////We had absolutely no room for dessert. I'd say maybe next time but given the wait and the "Okay-ness" of the meal, I don't think there will be a next time. I will try co-owned Girl and the Goat across the street though since I hear that is where the real fuss is- Very excited at the prospect.
