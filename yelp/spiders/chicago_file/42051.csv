Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Very good tapas here!! My only complaint is that the spicy potatos (my favorite tapas item) are only okay here. The sangria is great - they have a ton of different flavors. The mango sangria is really good. Usually there's a pretty long wait and it can get packed, but there is a lot of bar space, and I've always been able to squeeze into a spot to have a glass of sangria while waiting. The wait isn't quite as bad in the summer when they open up the huge outdoor seating area. Definitely a place to try if you like tapas! Also it has a great Lincoln Park location - close to a lot of shops and bars.
