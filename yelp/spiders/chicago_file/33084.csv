Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////But for real. This is some of the best food we have ever had. It isn't that we're obsessed (although let's not lie to ourselves here) that we think this, either. It's because it really is some of the best from start to finish: inventiveness, flavor, prep, plating, service, whatever, froth on. Like so good that we had to really nitpick to find constructive criticism. Maybe we are easy to please. We were unbelievably pleased.
