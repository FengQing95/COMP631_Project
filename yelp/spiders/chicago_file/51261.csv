Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have to say, we waited over 45 mins for our reservation tonight and I was very frustrated. By the end of the night, not only the food was amazing (as usual) and our server max was one of the best I've had. He was so kind and recommended the BEST food. I would come back for him alone- also the manager was very apologetic for the wait and was so kind. Would highly recommend for the food and customer service - worth the wait :)
