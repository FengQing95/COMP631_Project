Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I had heard about Bavette's for months before coming and it exceeded all of my expectations. The decor is both comfortable and sexy. The service was amazing. We sat at the bar and the bartender was on point the whole time. We shared the wedge and it was delicious. The pork belly was both crunchy and sweet. We shared a 16 oz Chicago rib eye, garlic mashed potatoes, and the creamed spinach.  The steak was cooked to perfection and almost melted in my mouth. It was so much food, I was happy we shared. Finally, we finished with the carrot cake. I will travel back to Chicago just for that carrot cake. It's far and away the best I've ever had.  Cocktails were great and I thought wine prices were reasonable. We'll be back for sure!
