Smoque BBQ////My wife took me for a birthday adventure. Got too long a wait to get in. Fairly uncomplicated menu. My wife isn't big on pork, so we ordered the 1/2 chicken with slaw and two sides: Mac and cheese and peach cobbler ( we were ecstatic about having dessert for a side!) Â with a taste of the Texas sausage and 1/4 slab of the St. Louis Ribs.
