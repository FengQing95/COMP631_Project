Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We had a blast tonight! Our good friend visiting from Japan, Â wanted to try something new and we decided to take her to one of our favorite restaurants, Cafe baba reeba! And she really enjoyed it! Moreover, there was no waiting this time for our seats and the service was excellent as always. This place is still one of my favorite places to have tapas. I definitely would eat here again and I definitely would recommend them to my friends and family.
