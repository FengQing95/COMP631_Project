Art Institute of Chicago////Both our six year old and soon to be two year old loved their visit.  It is amazingly child friendly with the Ryan education center for little people to get their energy out before heading to the galleries, a nice cafe with wonderful natural light and child friendly options, and free admission to children under 14.  Both little people loved the miniature rooms and our oldest enjoyed some of her grandparent's favorite impressionist masterpieces (surprising us saying she loved this pointillist painting, she had learned about the technique in her kindergarten art class).
