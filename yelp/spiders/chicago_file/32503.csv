Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The deep dish here was the best I've ever had!! I got the standard cheese pizza but it was so much more than that. The amount of cheese, the stringiness of it, the flavors from the tomatoes and seasoning. It was a dream! Eating the pizza was like butter in your mouth in the best way. The crust was thin and crisp, the flavors of the pizza was on point. It was so filling and I'd definitely recommend coming here for pizza if you're visiting Chicago! The atmosphere was very welcoming and inviting and overall it was a great experience. There is also plenty of tables for those with large parties as well.
