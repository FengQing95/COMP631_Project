Little Goat Diner////This was a decent place to enjoy an evening meal, but didn't quite meet the expectations I had either. First of all, as some previous reviews have mentioned, I think "diner" is a bit of a misnomer. Although the interior looks like the traditional American diner, the Little Goat is far from being a local greasy spoon. In terms of price and food, they are clearly aiming for a higher quality market. The place is popular- we had a thirty minute wait for a table after arriving (although this was a lot better than the 3 1/2 hours we were quoted down the road).
