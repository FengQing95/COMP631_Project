Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The service wasn't also very attentive - busboys would drop plates on our table without removing empty plates. The tables were also so close together that busboys were precariously dangling trays over our heads as they served other tables. All in all, sometimes the food was good, but simply because the ingredients were sometimes high-quality. The presentation and service seemed to fight against the food.
