Little Goat Diner////Just had our first meal at Little Goat.  Loved it!  Tried the barbecue sandwich with tangy slaw and house fries.  Delicious through the last bite!  In addition to the food, we really enjoyed the restaurant's atmosphere and staff.  Our waiter, Ezra, was exceptional:  he was attentive, personable and made us feel very much at home.  I waited tables through high school and college, and am a bit picky about restaurant service as a result.  I was very impressed with the staff at Little Goat.  They clearly enjoy the restaurant and convey that to customers in such a way that makes dining there even more delightful!
