Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's is one of a handful of really good Chicago pizzeria's. "The Lou" (perhaps not the best name if you're used to British English, but okay...) is a classic Chicago deep dish spinach pizza, and it's wonderful. The beer list was also quite presentable. We had an Antihero IPA, which was a perfect accompaniment to the pizza. They advertise the large as for four people, and, with three of us working on it, they weren't kidding. Service was great, and the ambiance is classic old-school Chicago pizza. This was our first visit to this particular location, but it more than lives up to the brand's well-deserved reputation.
