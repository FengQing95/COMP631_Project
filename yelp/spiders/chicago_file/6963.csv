Art Institute of Chicago////One of my favorite spots in Chicago and my favorite art museum hands down. We spend almost a full day there whenever Â we're visiting home. If you've never been and are in Chicago, go. You will not be disappointed. Even my husband, who is not an art lover, always enjoys going!
