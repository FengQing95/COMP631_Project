Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I love breakfast and I really liked this place. Did I love it? No. But the food is really good just not memorable. If I were in the area and parking were a little more convenient I would definitely go back Â - there's no parking lot but there's street parking but good luck because the place is a block from Michigan Avenue.
