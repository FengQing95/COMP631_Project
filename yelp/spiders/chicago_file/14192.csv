Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Chicagoans must have a high tolerance for waiting long periods of time, bad service, mediocre food and being treated like it's a privilege to eat there. We waited for an hour to get a table and then was told that our pizza would take another hour. Are you kidding me??? Two hours to get mediocre pizza?? I once bought a Pizzeria Uno frozen pizza from a supermarket that was as good as what I got here.
