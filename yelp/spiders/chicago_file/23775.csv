Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Chose this place randomly b/c it was halfway btwn me & a friend I was meeting. Got there around 10pm on a Friday night, line was down the street. I'm visiting from out of town & was shocked. I asked some girls in line "Are you guys waiting for PIZZA?!" They laughed & said "Yeah, hour & 15min wait". I checked in but started looking on my phone for another place to go while waiting for my friend to come. 3 tables ahead of us were no shows so our wait was much shorter than expected & we stayed. SO GLAD WE DID. I HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT.
