Little Goat Diner////Update: it is really frustrating when I leave an honest review, then the manager sends me a message offering for me to return to give the restaurant another try and specifies which email to contact them at, and when I do contact them I get no response. Sending a private message does not make anything better without acting upon what was said. Otherwise don't even bother to reach out.
