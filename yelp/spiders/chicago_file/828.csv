Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I ordered the special pumpkin bread french toast. The bread was thick and moist, but not my ideal for french toast. That doesn't mean I didn't eat every bite of it, though I probably wouldn't order it again. My dining companion ordered the berry pancakes, which is what I really wanted but, regretably I decided to get creative with pumpkin instead. His pancakes were perfect. Light and fluffy and covered with fresh berries. He shared so I wasn't completely deprived, but I will go for the pancakes next time around, that is certain.
