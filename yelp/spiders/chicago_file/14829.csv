Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's was recommended to us by a few people, and I'm really glad we tried it!  We sat at the bar and our bartender Katie was very sweet.  She was definitely busy (it was 1pm on a Saturday, full of tourists wanting to drink and eat :) ) but she kept checking on us exactly when I needed something.  (I.e. I was just running out of water and she looks over and fills me up...then we're about done and ready for the check and she looks over again and pretty much reads my mind)
