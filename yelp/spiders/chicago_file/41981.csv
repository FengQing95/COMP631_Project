Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba twice now. It has a great atmosphere with awesome sangria/cocktails, along with good food. They handle large groups incredibly well but you can also have a great time with a couple friends. It is a large place that is always packed so a reservation is a must. Â Two friends and myself has a 6pm reservation on a Saturday night and it was already pretty full. We ordered a pitcher of the Black Raspberry sangria and embraced the tapas style small plates. Their menu is large enough to please any dietary needs. At the same time, it is manageable and not too overwhelming. We ordered 6 plates for the three of us, and did not leave hungry. My three favorites were the spicy potatoes, chicken empenada, and Spanish sausages. I would order each of these dishes again. One of the things I was most impressed about was how our server did not rush us out the door even though the restaurant was packed. We lingered a little bit after paying our bill and ended up opening a second tab of drinks before calling it a night. Would definitely come back again. One of the most important things in order to have a positive experience is to go with a group of people willing to share and compromise on menu items. Also, since everything is shared, its best just to get a pitcher and split the check evenly at the end.
