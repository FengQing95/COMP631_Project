Smoque BBQ////In town from Seattle visiting family. Heard about this place online. The wife and I made this our must try spot before we left town. Decided to do a carryout since I heard about the lines and with nine of us didn't want to have kids wait long. I called in a pretty large order covering the entire menu, St. Louis ribs, brisket, pork, slaw, corn bread, peach cobbler and the bread pudding! The gal told me the wait was about 35min which was great for lunch. I arrived and my order was professionally packed up in a box ready to go with no wait!
