Smoque BBQ////This barbecue is arguably the best barbecue I have had anywhere in the United States. I have been eating here since the first day they open the door and the quality has never changed. They are still serving the same perfect food that they were at the very beginning.  Sample food darn good. That and great customer service is the key to a successful restaurant.  #fine-casualdining
