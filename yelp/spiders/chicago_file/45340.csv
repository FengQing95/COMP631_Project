Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba.  I've been to other tapas restaurants, many of which were described by friends as 'the best,' but this one still remains my favorite.  It has a very extensive menu of tapas and everything is generally well executed.  Because of this, I swear I've ended up here more than any other restaurant in Chicago (tapas or otherwise) because people always want to go.
