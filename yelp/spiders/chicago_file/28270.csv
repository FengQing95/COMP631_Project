Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I went based on the ratings from Yelp!!! I wanted the best Chicago style pizza I could find!! Now I'm traditional NY style pizza chick, but I had to try it. It was very buttery, thick and saucy, I had pepperoni and was only able to eat two slices!!! Pretty good, I still prefer my NY style pizza tho. I had wings for an app, the blue cheese was better than the wings: they were ok but taste like previously frozen wings. The restaurant was nice, clean and open. The staff was friendly and services was good. I recommend visiting for the Chicago style pizza, butter crust
