Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our waiter, David M. was such a bad waiter! We ordered the the LOU and added pepperoni. When the pizza was brought out, we noticed there was not any pepperoni on it. He finally came to our table and we told him that there wasn't any pepperoni on it. He returned with his small notebook and said he didn't write it down. Instead of being apologetic for not taking the correct order, he made it seem that it was our fault that he didn't write it down and walked away. RUDE!!
