Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is where you go if you are an out of towner and want to try a Chicago deep dish pizza. Â I went here because a friend suggested it and I was not disappointed. Very delicious pizza and very nice portion. The recommended sizes to person amount is pretty spot on. I was dining with one other person; we got the medium that feeds 2-3 people only because we wanted leftovers for the plane. It would have been the perfect amount for 3 people. Unfortunately they don't have a location directly in downtown so we had to travel a bit but it was worth it. Get the Lou Malnati's special with sausage and buttery crust!
