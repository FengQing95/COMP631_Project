The Purple Pig////Year after year, visit after visit still one of my favorite places to eat at in Chicago.  My only wish is that the restaurant was less crowded - seems no matter what time I pick the wait is LONG!!  That said I have yet to finish a meal and think the wait was not worth it - this place is totally worth waiting for.
