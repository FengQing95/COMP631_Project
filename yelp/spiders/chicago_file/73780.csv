Little Goat Diner////If you're looking for something really different, definitely check out the little goat. Â  We came in seeking out a little more standard fare and didn't realize how many unique and interesting ingredients were going to be offered. I ordered the corned beef hash which was tasty & my boyfriend ordered the Spanish omelette (which came with pickled habanero peppers that totally knocked my boyfriends socks off- in a good way!) the home fries were delish with a drunken goat cheese on top which was such a treat. We loved the decor and the waitress was very nice & helpful. I'm sure we will be back to try out the lunch menu next time we visit Chicago :)
