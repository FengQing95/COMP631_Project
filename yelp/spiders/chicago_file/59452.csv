Smoque BBQ////We got the brisket and the chicken, with a side of the pulled pork for good measure. While I don't often eat gut-busting loads of BBQ...I totally would at this place, every day of the week, if I could get away with it. Delicious, perfectly prepared. The meat truly is the star of the show here; any sauce a modest second player. Â
