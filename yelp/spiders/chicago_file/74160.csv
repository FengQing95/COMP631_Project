Little Goat Diner////This is a place that gets quite a lot of attention.....We stopped in for lunch and after waiting for a bit, we were seated at a communal table in the middle of the restaurant. Not my first choice, especially in a loud restaurant, but that's what we got. Our server (Patrick) was friendly and even though he seemed to be training someone, he did a nice job.
