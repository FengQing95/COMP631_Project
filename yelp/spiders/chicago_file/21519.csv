Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my first experience with deep dish pizza and it was exceptional! I loved it! My husband and I split a small Malnati Chicago Classic and it was definitely enough to share. He thought it was really good but said he has had better deep dish pizza so I will stick with 4 stars. It was definitely worth visiting!
