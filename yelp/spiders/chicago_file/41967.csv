Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I think I needed a restaurant to inspire me to write my first review on yelp. This place was it - so awful that I have to share with others to hopefully save you a trip here. I eat out like it is my job and this was by far the worst tapas restaurant I Â have ever been to. Came on a weeknight for a quick dinner. Had a 30 minute wait and when we were seated, the waiter took his time coming around to our table. We place our order and tapas start coming out but he managed to completely forget about my sister's sangria order. With the lack of service, she didn't receive it until we were eating our last order of tapas because it took that long for one of the numerous people we flagged down to actually go tell our server he forgot about the drink! His excuse, "Oh sorry, I couldn't read my own handwriting!" Wow, I mean wow. There are so many things I could say right now but its just too easy so I will pass. I am sure you just thought of a few things yourself.
