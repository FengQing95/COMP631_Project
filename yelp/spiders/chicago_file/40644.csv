Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////i've been to most (but not all) of the chicago tapas bars. i'm no aficionado, but i was quite happy with babareeba when i was living in LP. the sangria is good, and the bacon wrapped dates were freaking amazing. the best part was the happy hour 1/2 price tapas (drinks, too, i think).. definitely a good reason to rush home from work.
