Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cute and cozy restaurant in a trendy neighborhood. I personally really enjoy the tapas style restaurant and have had some really good experiences at other tapas restaurants- but this one will not be added to that list. The food was nothing special- super heavy and greasy. I was pretty disappointed. Our service was good however. Probably won't be coming back or recommending this place.
