Little Goat Diner////Love it! Been here a few times and the wait staff are always very knowledgeable and genuine. There's usually a pretty substantial wait to be seated, but it's definitely worth it! Even if you don't like chili cheese fries, I highly recommend them here--they don't get soggy like you'd expect, and the chili is super flavorful. But the one thing you HAVE to get is the Fat Elvis waffles...you'll be in heaven.
