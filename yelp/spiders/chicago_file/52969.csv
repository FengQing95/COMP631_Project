Smoque BBQ////Ok, so this place made me fall in love with BBQ. I was so hesitant to go because I am not a BBQ fan (Weird, I know, but I dont usually like the stickiness of it). I got the beef and it was incredible. It has been 5 long months since I have been here and can hardly wait to go back. Beware that on a weekend there will probably be a line, we waited probably 15-20 minutes but it was definitely worth it. The BBQ sauce they use is out of this world, I even took the small amount I had left home so my family could try it!
