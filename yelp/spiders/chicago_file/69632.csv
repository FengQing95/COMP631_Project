Little Goat Diner////The menu employs unique preparations and interesting ingredients and the waitress (Raquel) was friendly and helpful. Cute hipster-y waitstaff uniforms. But the food?  Wasn't amazing. The smoked fries were an unusual but savory and good starter but the shrimp and grits lacked in hearty flavor what they contained in creativity.  I've had better at more than one Chicago brunch spot.
