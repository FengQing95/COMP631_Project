Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////OMG this was the best steak by far that I have ever had, and the sides were all awesome, and the drinks were all awesome, and we went with great friends, so the company was awesome, and the service was awesome, and the sharing wine was awesome. Â Did I mention I like the place?
