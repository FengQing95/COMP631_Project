Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I made reservations based on yelp reviews and the high ratings. Very classy establishment with great service. We ordered the 24 oz prime dry aged ribeye. It was a bit charred and burnt. Even with dim lighting I can tell. Worse. I can taste it. I spit it out. I've been to quite a few steak houses and this is by far the worse. I tried so hard to eat my $56 steak. The more I chew, the more I hated it. It was over cooked and dry. I was disappointed.
