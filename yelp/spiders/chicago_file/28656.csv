Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Seen this place on TV for years so I had to try it being in Chicago for a couple days. Got there just in time where we were able to walk in an sit right down. Within minutes the lobby was packed and people were lined up outside. The app calamari was terrible. Soggy oily and mushy with a jazzed up ketchup sauce. Back home on the east coast this would have been an embarrassment. Ordered a medium cheese deep dish. Pizza was good. Buttery crunchy crust with plenty of cheese and just enough sauce. Nice staff and atmosphere.
