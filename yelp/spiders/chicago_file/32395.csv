Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////we were in chicago and so were going to eat chicago pizza. Â previously i had tried giordanos so this time i wanted to try lou malnatis - also lou has an everyday lunch special in which you can get a salad or soup + personal pizza or pasta; and this is a good way to try a couple of different dishes.
