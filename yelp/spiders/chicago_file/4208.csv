The Purple Pig////1) steak - I cannot remember what kind of steak this was, but I know it was served with green garlic and breadcrumbs. This was definitely my favorite dish. The meat cut easily with a butter knife and it was so flavorful. There were about 4 slices on the plate, each slice being roughly 2 bites.
