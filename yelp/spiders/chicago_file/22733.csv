Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Out of the big 3 deep dish joint (Giordano's & Gino's being the other two), I would say that this is my favorite. I find the sauce to crust/ topping ratio to be just right. They have plenty of pre-made options but finding your own combo is what I'd recommend. Lou's doesn't do anything crazy with their pies but that's not what you're looking for when you want deep dish anyways...
