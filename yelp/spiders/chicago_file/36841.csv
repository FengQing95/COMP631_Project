Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bread/butter SO good, but tread carefully to save space for main event. Don't pass on Brussels! Bone In Dry Aged Ribeye (medium rare) was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Â Smoked Trout Caesar exceeded expectations. So did our server, Joel, who turned the meal into a phenomenal experience. Thanks Joel! 11/10
