Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Oh what a pizza pie it is.    We live in Minneapolis but order Lou Malnatis pizza online.   This is classic Chicago Pizza.   We had a seminar with Lou's and I learned we build our pizza backward.  Put the cheese down and then the sauce.  The cheese helps protect the crust.   Also, hit the pizza pan with a little oil and once it's hot out the oizza dough in and it will give it a crispy crust.
