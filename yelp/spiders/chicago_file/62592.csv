Smoque BBQ////I know a lot of BBQ fans are all about the pork, but I am a beef girl. I love the brisket at Smoque--beautiful dark edges, pink smoke line, and a tender, melt-in-your mouth center that is soooo good. Every time I order a sandwich I take off one slice of brisket so I can eat it all by itself last, so that taste will linger long after I am done eating. I can't rate sauce on my brisket because I take it plain. As I said, I am a beef girl.
