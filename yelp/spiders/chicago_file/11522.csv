Art Institute of Chicago////I used to adore AIC. I was a member for years. Now they have installed a motion detectors throughout the Museum that beep loudly and incessently throughout the building. It is an annoying distraction and serves no purpose as there are security guards everywhere. I will not return. Headphones do not work to cancel the beeping sound.
