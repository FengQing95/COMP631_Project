Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////For the food, I wanted to order some really typical Spanish stuff so we went with Tortilla, Croquetas, Calamares, and Jamon. Overall, they were really good and they were close to the flavours of my country. The only one that fell a bit short was the jamon, but it was still good. It certainly met my expectations.
