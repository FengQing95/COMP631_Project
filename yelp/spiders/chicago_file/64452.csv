Smoque BBQ////The Carolina-style sauce certainly tastes great on anything--including the corn bread--but meat portion sizes are small and it's a little expensive for what you get. I've been here twice over the past few years and I don't recall feeling full. I wish I could recall the day of week and time of day that wasn't busy, because when it was busy, the wait was very long. I'll go back this summer and try to figure out what they put in the cole slaw because it's remarkably good. The outdoor seating was not very comfortable and there were a lot of little flying pests.
