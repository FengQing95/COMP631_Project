Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////- Bavette's Spiced Fried Chicken (as an appetizer; most people would not think about ordering chicken at a steakhouse, but this was arguably the best item on the menu, as well as the best fried chicken I've ever had in my life - with apologies to Nashville's hot chicken) 5/5
