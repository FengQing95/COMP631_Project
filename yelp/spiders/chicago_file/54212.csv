Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here for dinner on the Fourth, sun-dried, haggard, slightly disoriented, and with high expectations.  Although I'm utterly disdainful of the whole "tapas" fad in the U.S., the quality of the food here made up for it.  And for the course of one glorious mouth-watering meal, I forgot that I was in a bourgeois yuppie Spanish-style theme park.
