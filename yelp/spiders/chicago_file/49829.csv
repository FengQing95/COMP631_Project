Smoque BBQ////We just ordered lunch for 15 folks at my office. I faxed the order over to Smoque and included the names of my co-workers & clients after each of their orders, ie: (1 brisket sandwich w/slaw & peach cobbler - Pattie). When I arrived to pick it up, the food was in 3 big boxes with each order bagged separately & each bag had a name tag attached. It made our life soooo much simpler when distributing the food and made sure that all of the sides were included. We love you Smoque, thanks for the delicious food!
