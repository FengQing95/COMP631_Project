Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////A few of my favorite dishes are the bacon wrapped dates, the scallops, the shrimp and the lamb. Â Their paella was also very tasty but you have to order it at the start of your meal or before you arrive as it takes 45 minutes to prepare. The desserts are also great, try the banana.
