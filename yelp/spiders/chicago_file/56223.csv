Smoque BBQ////I have been to Smoque more than several times over the past few years and I have never been disapointed.  The ribs are the best that I've ever had in Chicago, always tender.  The beans are good, the french fries pretty crispy.  The brisket is good too but not my favorite cut of meat.  The pulled-pork is good too.
