Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food and drinks were great, however I thought it was a little over hyped and expensive. The sides were great but the steaks / seafood main dishes were good but nothing exceptional. I enjoyed the ambiance and the decor inside. I think this would be a great place for a work dinner with a larger group if you can get a reservation. Â The staff was great - very knowledgeable and attentive. Hope to come back here post covid so I can bring my own wine as well.
