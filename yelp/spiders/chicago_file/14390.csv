Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Okay, here's the deal. I don't like their pizza.  I don't like deep dish in general, but I particularly, seriously, don't like theirs.  Okay, so that's my problem, why the heck do I go there?. When I have guests in from out of town, they always want to go, and they always enjoy it. I turn my nose up at the pizza and have the spicy buffalo wings, and I like those just fine, and go through a huge pile of napkins and make a mess, so all good. The crowd is bustling, once you get seated the service is generally very good, and it's a pretty fun place to go, get a pitcher of beer and enjoy watching your out-of-town guests get into Chicago style pizza. So as much as I don't like their pizza, I am still a fan for the overall noisy, crowded, fun experience.
