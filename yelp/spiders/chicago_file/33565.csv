Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////So I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars here. The ambience was wonderful but the service was lacking (busser/helper was great, server seemed to be over deployed/too many tables). Good old fashioned (multiple options) and good sides (bacon, Brussels sprouts, broccoli and fries, though fries left a little to be desired). Saw some amazing salads go by but didn't try any. On the other hand, the dry aged bone in ribeye was at least 1/3 gristle. Like both my dining partner and I actually had to spit food out at the table. I just feel like the main star of the show could have been better -- the pieces of meat that were not gristle and pure fat were delicious but they were fewer than expected. So maybe 3.5 stars with a round up to 4 for ambience.
