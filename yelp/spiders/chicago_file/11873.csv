Art Institute of Chicago////Cons: Got lost getting to their restaurant Terzo Piano, took me about 30 minutes walking up and down the stairs, but it was worth the effort, so get very detailed instructions if you are close to missing the lunch (it's only until 3pm). This is super nit picky, but I wish all the art had an audio option, since it enjoyed it so much!!
