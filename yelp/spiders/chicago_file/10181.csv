Art Institute of Chicago////Loved the location and loved the focus on American classics as well as their exhibit on wartime propaganda. Also loved the side exhibit displaying parts of skycrapers. Interesting to see how ornate parts of the building are. I enjoyed the layout and didn't feel bored b the exhibits the way I usually do. Kudos!
