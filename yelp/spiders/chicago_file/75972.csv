Little Goat Diner////The Little gout was pretty good.  This us not the place if you're in a hurry but a great place uf you are ready to be full.  All of the food I tried was great.  I had the Korean Burger with Beef and loved it.  I also had the Home Fries that I add whichbwas more than I could eat.
