Smoque BBQ////Overall, pricing was quite fair, especially when you consider the portions. All of our food plus 2 fountain drinks (and free cup of water) came out to just under $60. We used an a la card so our total bill was even cheaper at $49. We easily found free street parking. The decor isn't anything to write home about, but that's not why you're there.
