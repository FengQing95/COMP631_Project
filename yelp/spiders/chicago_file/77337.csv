Little Goat Diner////We ordered the nachos... It's made with bbq pork, I guess it's more of a preference... it was still good but I prefer beef or chicken. The Mac and Cheese was delicious! My husband ordered the patty melt. Very generous portions and made perfectly medium. The fries were crisp and seasoned well. Â We also ordered the shrimp app as well. It really didn't do much for us... It was basically just presentation.
