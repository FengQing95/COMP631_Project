Little Goat Diner////Little Goat was pretty delicious. We wanted to go out for a nice but casual dinner, so we decided to check out LG. We went to Girl and the Goat a few months ago, and it gave us full faith in Stephanie Izard to make me feel happily delicious, so we knew that Little Goat would be a great place to go.
