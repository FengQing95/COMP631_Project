Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This Lettuce Entertain You place is a solidly good choice, which is quite obvious considering the perpetual crowds.  I have enjoyed the food more in my fast couple of visits than I have in the past.  Don't know if something has changed at the restaurant in the past year or so, or if I have just gotten lucky with ordering.  But anyway, their house-made bread is really good and all the brunch/tapas dishes I have tried recently have been very nice.  Most recently, my husband and I tried their tuna tartare special, which was seasoned with shoyu (soy sauce) and some thinly sliced red peppers, and served with potato chips.  Very tasty.  The bloody mary bar is really good.  Bloody maries are drinks that I haven't really enjoyed until recently.  It's both a blessing and a curse to be able to mix your own.  This place gets really crowded at dinner, so I enjoy going there at brunch.  The service is very friendly.  I recommend it as a good, reliable choice on the Lincoln Park stretch of Halsted.  It won't blow your mind necessarily, but it's a great place to get together with friends over some good food and beverages.
