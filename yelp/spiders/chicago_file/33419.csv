Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The best restaurants are the ones that exceed your expectations. For Bavette's, the bar was set incredibly high. I've never heard a negative review. Not only did people tell me how great their experience was, but when asked what I should order, they said I could do no wrong. Everyone was absolutely right. The service was impeccable. Like all of the Hogsalt restaurants, the atmosphere transported you to a different place, perhaps a different time. The upstairs is lively and loud while the downstairs is somewhat secluded, both equally appealing. We sat downstairs and I would definitely recommend it if you are celebrating a special occasion with a small group. The first thing you notice on the table is the single candlestick that by the end of the meal will almost burned through its useful life. It is difficult to say what I liked best about their menu, it was traditional yet also unique. I opted with traditional, starting with a gimlet. For food, we started with a wedge salad and garlic shrimp. The bacon in the wedge salad made it worth it in itself. I ordered the New York Strip, medium rare. As expected, it was flawless. Cooked perfectly and a great cut of meat. What makes or breaks a steakhouse is the sides. There were too many to chose from but the mashed potatoes and spinach were unreal. Finally, if you haven't eaten enough yet, you should save room for dessert. The chocolate cream pie was incredibly light and delicious. We left satisfied and full, ready for another visit.
