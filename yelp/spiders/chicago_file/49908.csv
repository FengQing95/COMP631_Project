Smoque BBQ////On this occasion, my friend and I shared a half rack of the St. Louis Ribs and were not disappointed.  I love my Baby Backs, but there's enough of me to go around.  Very flavorful and tender.  And don't forget to incorporate the semi-sweet BBQ Sauce.  It is not the same as the vinegar-based brisket BBQ sauce.
