Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ugh I wanted to like this so bad, but it just wasn't good! Came to visit from CA and had high hopes, but it honestly just seems overhyped I've had better back home. We got "the Lou" and a salad and despite waiting 40 mins for our food to come out the deep dish was still room temperature so idk wtf that was about. Anyhow, nothing special...
