Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I had the lunch special, which is a salad and a personal pizza with a drink, plus I ordered a starter of garlic bread. The salad was a typical side salad, so nothing good or bad there. To be fair, I love me some garlic, but the garlic bread seemed somewhat bland. Definitely needed the marinara sauce on the side to help give it some flavor. The pizza itself was good, but not as good as Giordano's, IMO. On the plus side, the lunch special is available on the weekends at Lou Malnati's, which is not true for Giordano's, so if that's what you're after, then Lou Malnati's is not a bad option. If I'm given a choice, though, I'm still going to Giordano's.
