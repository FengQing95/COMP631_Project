Smoque BBQ////I can see why folks who live in Irving/Portage Park might give Smoque 4 or 5 stars, it's a nice place in an area which doesn't have a whole lot going on in terms of interesting or exciting eats. Â The spartan decor of the dining room does not bother me (though so far all my visits have been take-out).
