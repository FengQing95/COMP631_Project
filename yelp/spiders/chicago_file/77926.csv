Little Goat Diner////Little Goat Diner was quite underwhelming and not worth the hype. We went on a Friday morning -- it was busy but the wait wasn't long. Unfortunately, we waited almost 20 minutes to be noticed by a waitress (in a different section! Not even our own..). She apologized for the wait and moved us to a table in her own section. Not a great start, but ok.
