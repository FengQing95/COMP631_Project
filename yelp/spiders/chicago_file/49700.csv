Smoque BBQ////I believe most of you already know about my preference to avoid pork, which generally significantly reduces my options at B-B-Q joints. But I was able to order Smoque's chopped brisket sandwich with cole slaw and brisket chili (Wednesday's special side dish) [$8.95]. Soft drinks (Coca-Cola products) are $1.25.
