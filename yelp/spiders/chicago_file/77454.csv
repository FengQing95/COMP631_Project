Little Goat Diner////Go here. Now. Go again and again and again. Eat all of your meals here in one day.  I am so sad I no longer live in Chicago, even sadder that I could have been within walking distance of this amazing place.  I expected it to be good, I was unprepared for how freaking incredible it was!
