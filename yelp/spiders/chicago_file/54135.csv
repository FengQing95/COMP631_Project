Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Love this place. Located right in the hot restaurant strip of Lincoln park. Has a small restaurant feel but still has a lot of space! The pinxtos, garlic potato salad and tortilla espanola are my absolute favorites and I get them every time. I enjoy getting to try a lot of flavors because the plates are small and sharing is fun with a group. Big fan!
