Smoque BBQ////I did not like the feeling like I was being pushed out by people hovering for a table although it slowed by the end of my meal. This understandable due to the size of the place. Overall decent prices but over rated. Good place for people who have not experienced real Texas style or Memphis BBQ. In my opinion Honkey Tonk BBQ in Pilsen is superior and much more authentic.
