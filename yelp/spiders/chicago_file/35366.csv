Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Amazing food and service! The wait time for a table was a little long (didn't have a reservation) but we enjoyed ourselves at the bar.  Every single drink was delicious. The guys behind the bar are true artists. Food is all amazing.  They do dry-aged exceptionally well. I kind of wanted to keep this place under locking key, but I guess the secrets out.  For good reason.  High five, chests bumps, slap on the butt. Bavettes are the champions!
