Art Institute of Chicago////A world class museum in Millennium Park that has an astonishing collection of impressionist art, along with great collections of art from antiquity and beyond. They have a solid lineup of exhibitions that pass through the museum, Andy Warhol currently! The geographical connection to the city, the park, and the lake combine to have an effect that you're not entirely sure where exactly the exhibits begin, or end... it's not just within the walls of the building itself. Love it!
