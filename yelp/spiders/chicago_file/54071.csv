Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Firstly, come to the build your own bloody mary brunch on the weekends. Those who know me understand that I've had a rather fickle relationship with this much celebrated tomato based drink. Brunch, itself, is a meal that rather confounds me, but I've made my peace with the bloody after discovering the world of 'build your own.' Not arguing that the BYOBloody is the best in the city... it's simply a solid selection of side items such as kosher dill pickles, tasty bacon strips, olives and of course, celery. Zing Zang is the standard in bloody mixes, and they keep it pouring at Ba-Ba-Reeba.
