Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First off, I will start with a negative...whyyyyyy aren't you on the West Coast???  This pizza was soooo amazing.  We didn't realize how filling it would be so we started with the mozzarella cheese sticks...bad plan...they are so GREAT you eat them all....THEN, they have the nerve to bring you this unbelievably AMAZING PIZZA!!  WHAT???  Ok...they give you enough time in between to make you realize that they are actually taking time to cook a deep dish pizza...(I say this because I read a review that was unhappy about how much time it takes to get your pizza...) sit back, have a drink, (which was also wonderful btw)...and wait... THE ONLY THING YOU WILL REGRET IS THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE A LOCATION NEAR WHERE YOU LIVE IF YOU ARE FROM OUT OF TOWN...YUMMMMMMMMMM.... uhhhh ohhhh, I just saw they ship frozen pizza...k..NOW I AM SUPER HAPPY!!
