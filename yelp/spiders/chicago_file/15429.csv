Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've been to this Lou's location for both take out and sit-down and the wait was a lot better than the long lines at the Lincoln Ave location.  First of all, anything with the name buttercrust is an obvious way to lure me in.  It is indeed buttery.  While eating in, I've done several of the fried appetizers which are all greasy goodness personified.  Mmm.  I could go for some Lou's right now.  Do you deliver to my work?
