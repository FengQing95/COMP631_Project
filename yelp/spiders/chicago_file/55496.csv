Smoque BBQ////Like so many people, I saw this restaurant on Diners Drive-Ins & Dives. I went on a Saturday for lunch and the line was out the door. By the time you order and get your food there seems to always been an open table so that is nice. Its a BYOB place, which I will probably utilize next time.
