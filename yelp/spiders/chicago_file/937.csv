Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////As I slowly make my way around all the breakfast places in Chicago, Wildberry was on the list. My mom and I went on a Saturday afternoon about 9. We were seated immediately, and offered coffee right away. I had the veggie omelet with pancakes while my mom just had sausage and hashbrowns. The veggie omelet was good and the pancakes were tasty, but I agree with other reviewers. Nothing to wait in line for.
