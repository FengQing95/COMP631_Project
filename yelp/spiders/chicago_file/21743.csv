Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm a huge fan of Chicago Style Pizza! Anytime we are in town one of our first stops is for Pizza! I've tried them all! Giardano's, Gino's East, Uno, and Due! Up until today Uno was my favorite! Â Lou Malnati's has just moved into the top spot! The crust on the pizza was amazing, and we absolutely loved the lean sausage that topped our pizza! We will definitely make this one of our top spots to eat!
