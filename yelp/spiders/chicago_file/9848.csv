Art Institute of Chicago////The staff is REALLY friendly. The Morgan Library staff has to be the MOST unfriendly and thuggish museum I've ever been to in my life. I love the Morgan--truly love it--but the security guards are scary and rude. You can't even take a picture in the CAFE of your FOOD--I trust Yelpers will feel the same outrage about missing a picture of the perfect grass fed burger with Vermont white cheddar cheese or a High Tea sampler!
