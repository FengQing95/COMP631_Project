Smoque BBQ////This is the best place in the world for chopped brisket and hand-cut french fries!  So good, in fact, that I have yet to ever try anything else on the menu - I just don't need to.  The brisket is consistently juicy and delicious with a near-perfection darkening of the outside (that gets mixed in when they chop it so I always order chopped instead of sliced).  And the fries are consistently crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside.  (So many places have trouble getting a really good crunchy outside, but Smoque gets it right every time.)
