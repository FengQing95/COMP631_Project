Smoque BBQ////This place is awesome.  My wife is from the South and everywhere I had taken her for bbq was not up to snuff.  Until this place.  We love the pulled pork sandwiches, the St. Louis style ribs and the Texas sausage.  The cole slaw is crisp and not a creamy mess like other places.  As for the fries, I would go there for them even if they didn't have the 'que. On a summer weekend the line will typically go out the door and down the side of the building. There are few places I would are worth the wait, but this is one of them.
