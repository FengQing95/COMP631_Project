Little Goat Diner////Not sure what criteria is used to identify "allergy friendly" restaurants, this is rated as a good one, maybe just refers to gluten allergy.  Can't rate the restaurant because they could not accommodate a severe nut allergy nor did they seem interested in trying.  I called ahead to make sure but was given no assurances in terms of cross contamination or any precautions to ensure a "safe" meal.
