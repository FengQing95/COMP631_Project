Smoque BBQ////Best barbecue north of Tennessee. This place serves up some quality bbq for a decent price. The side portions are pretty weak for a true southern eater, and I'm waiting for the day they add potato salad to their menu. However, this place takes the (peach) cake for the best barbecue in Chicago.
