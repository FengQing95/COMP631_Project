Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Adding to the annoyance, I'm gluten-free and paleo/low-carb and they charge a buck extra for side salad. Why is that? A pile of leaves can't cost them more than hashbrowns, toast, or fruit. It's clearly not about the buck for either me or Wildberry, but we fall squarely on opposite sides of "the principle of the thing".
