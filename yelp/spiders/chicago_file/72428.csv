Little Goat Diner////Cute little spot in the West Loop but I would suggest reservations- even for lunch! We sat outside on the sidewalk patio which wasn't overwhelmingly loud. I had a scone which was fantastic and very reasonably priced and an iced latte that was more expensive than what I desired. I also had the yogurt and granola which was very sweet but the granola was fantastic! I didn't have adventurous food choices but overall thought it was yummy! Will go back.
