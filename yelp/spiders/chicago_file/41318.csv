Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////So I wrote a review of Tapas Barcelona where I stated how much I love Café BaBaReeba and realized I never actually bothered to write a review of Café BaBaReeba.  So for completeness sake I'll do it now.  Love this place.  Almost always get the plato de la casa to start off although somedays just get the plate of Serrano ham as it's the best part of the house plate.  Atmosphere is fun, although crowded on Friday/Saturday nights.  Only complaint was the best dish they had was a spicy pork dish that has been gone for about a year now.  Losing that dish was a disaster, please please please bring it back!
