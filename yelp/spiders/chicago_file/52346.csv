Smoque BBQ////Solid bbq joint, not too far off I90/94, so a good stop off on the way to the airport if you're coming from the south. Seating is managed by the host (no reservations), but I've never had to actually wait for a table, even though this place has been super busy the 10+ times I've visited.
