Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////You can't go wrong with the menu but you must order one of the paella's if you are a real foodie. But, of course, I always go with different meats when ordering tapas. My favorite was the short rib style, so tender. The sauces that came with everything had a taste that could last forever in your mouth.
