Little Goat Diner////Visiting my friend in Chicago and wanted to go to Girl and the Goat but realized we wanted lunch so we opted for Little Goat. The wait wasn't so long and we got seated and the menu was say to least amazing. It took us a bit to decide but I ended up getting the Los Drowed. It was delicious! It was so tender and the dip it came with was complimented it well. My friend got the Reuben but bring from New York. Nothing can beat a NY Reuben. It was odd and seemed like all the ingredients didn't match.
