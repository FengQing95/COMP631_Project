Little Goat Diner////Huge, varied menu with delicious options including brunch served all day. Lots of interesting twists on classic brunch fare including pork belly pancakes and Cajun crab crumpets. I had the "Little Piggy Went to China" and it was a delicious - eggs, biscuit, Szechuan sausage, and a delicious sauce. Fianc√©e ordered the pork belly pancakes and they were perfectly balanced with the slaw/salad on top.
