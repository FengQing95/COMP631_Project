Little Goat Diner////A personal favorite in the West Loop. Little Goat never ceases to amaze me with their quirky twists on American diner classics. Kimchi rueban, sloppy GOAT....even their grilled cheese has guanciale on it! Everything I've tried here has been outstanding and fresh. They're great for brunch, lunch and dinner too! Though there might be a wait, trust me it's worth it! They have one of the best rooftop patios in the city, so wait the extra time for the full outdoor experience!
