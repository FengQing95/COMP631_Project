Smoque BBQ////What Smoque does well - BBQ. What Smoque does not do well - Carryout service. I called at 7:50 last night and placed an order. The guy on the phone said it would be ready in 20 minutes. I got there at 8:13 and apparently they had not even started filling my order. I paid, then they started making my order thus rendering calling ahead pointless. At 8:28 my order was ready and sitting on the counter. After waiting for name to be called, I walked over and asked if that was my order to which the woman at the counter said "ohhh, I didn't know you were here." Ummm, you would have known if you had simply called my name or order number. That's ok, people screw up, no big deal but at least have the decency to say "I'm sorry that we're 25 minutes late in getting this order to you" or something to that effect. Someday businesses will learn that apologies cost them nothing to give, while withholding them definitely cost them business.
