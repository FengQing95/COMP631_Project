Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Well I thought I would try a deep dish pizza while in Chicago and was recommended this place by a friend. I am probably not too much of a pizza lover to truly enjoy or appreciate this kind of pizza, it was nice but really nothing to ride home about (again not much of a pizza connaisseur), however I sure didn't enjoy the service.
