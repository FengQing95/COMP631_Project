The Purple Pig////The bone marrow came out topped with this cilantro and onion mix that was tossed in some kind of oil (or maybe even the marrow juices), with some salt on the side, perfectly toasted and buttered bread, and the humongous bone that was the star of the show. The kind server instructed us to spread the marrow on the bread, toss some of the cilantro mix on top, and sprinkle some salt. My skin pricked right up on my first bite and I got the shivers, it was that good! I normally hate cilantro, but everything just went great together.
