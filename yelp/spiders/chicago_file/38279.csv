Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The fried chicken and truffle Mac n cheese is my absolute favorite. And can we talk about the house made sour dough they bring to the table? Let me die and go to carb heaven. The portions are huge, ALMOST too huge. You have left overs for days, and I'm not complaining about it.
