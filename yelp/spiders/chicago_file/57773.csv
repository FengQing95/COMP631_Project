Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Love this spot - my girlfriends and I always love coming here to get some food and drinks to catch up. Sangria flights are my favorite thing about this place. Their food is incredible -- I would never have tried bacon wrapped dates on my own but a friend recommended it and they were amazing.
