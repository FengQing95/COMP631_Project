Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place was my first tapas experience and it was amazing! Certainly set the bar high for tapas. The service is super friendly and the servers helpful since there are so many options. The ambiance is so energetic and friendly. You feed off the energy of everyone else which is always fun. This is a great place to come with a group but there are definitely different areas and feels with different parts of the restaurant. In the summer, they have a patio which is always fun to sit out on! The best part of Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba of course is the food. The plates are small - tapas sized- but all filling and delicious. The bacon wrapped dates are a must-try, a unique combo bursting with flavor. They also serve paella which is so cool to see them stir and serve. Be aware the paella is huge! So definitely more filling than the other small plates. Sangria is a must-try here as well, perfectly mixed and fruity! Great and fun dining experience that won't break the bank!
