Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////There's not much to say that hasn't already been said.  The food is delicious, albeit pricey, but the quality is there to justify it.  We went pretty early (6:30ish) on a weeknight and it was quiet to start but by the time we got our food, the restaurant was pretty busy.  We were very close to the other tables, which I didn't care for but the food and drinks more than made up for it.
