Little Goat Diner////Anyways, not to get into the details, but the service went far above and beyond anything I would have expected.  In a city where a good amount of the "trendy" restaurants treat you like you should be honored to be eating at their feet, it was refreshing to see.  The service, coupled with the fact that some of the menu items are absolutely fantastic, this place deserves a 5-star.
