Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////People always ask me where to go for Chicago deep dish pizza, and I always recommend Lou Malnatis.  If you're vegetarian, go for The Lou, otherwise, definitely try the pepperoni (which can be on the spicy side) or order sausage.  There is 2 ways to order sausage at Lou Malnatis, so make sure you know what you are getting into.  If you order sausage, it will come as a giant sheet of sausage as an entire layer of the pizza.  If you tell them easy sausage, it will come in the more traditional way of having pieces of sausage sprinkled on top of the pie.  You can't go wrong with either, just a matter of personal preference.  Either way, this is my hands down favorite place to go for authentic Chicago Deep Dish pizza.
