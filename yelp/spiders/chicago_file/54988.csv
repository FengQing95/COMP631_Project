Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Food: This is a classic tapas place - nothing new, nothing different. Very solid menu but it lacks inventive dishes. To boot, I don't think the flavors or ingredients were that good. The paella was extremely salty, the sauteed shrimp tasted like frozen shrimp from Trader Joes, and the brussel sprouts were a snooze.
