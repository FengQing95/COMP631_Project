Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Any version of the pizza is delicious.  And at all the locations.  If been to the one downtown, Gurnee, Wilmette, Buffalo Grove, Libertyville.  Never a disappointment.  I've even had them sent to Washington  to have 2 pizzas meet me there when I flew in.  And Those were mouth watering.  A little pricey 60.00 for 2 9" pizzas.  But I ate very last crumb.
