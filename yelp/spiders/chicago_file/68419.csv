Little Goat Diner////We had a group of 5 and shared part of the communal table. Our waitress was friendly, attentive, and let us enjoy our meal and his birthday without being overbearing. We were all definitely hungry, so make sure you entire party is with you when your table is called or they will wait to seat you.
