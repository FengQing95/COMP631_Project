Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is absolutely delicious and the price was not bad at all! The things that I loved were the chiorzo wrapped dates and the flan! The dates were so sweet like candy and the salty and savory chiorzo went so well with them- such a great bite! The flan was so creamy and the caramel was amazing and tasted like honey! (the flan is small/tapas sized as well).
