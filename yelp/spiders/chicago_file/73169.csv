Little Goat Diner////Give me nachos or give me death! Being from LA, i'm pretty serious about my nacho situation. Sometimes restaurants don't get the chip right! The chip is the most important fools! Its the foundation of the dish. MUST - GET - IT - RIGHT! Mr. Little Goat - Thank you for getting it right. Who knew? Pancakes here are delicious, milk shakes are great! They also give pretty good french fry as well. Can't go wrong with anything on this diner menu. Â Amazing coffee too. I'll pretty much eat anything they make. There I said it.
