Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Terrific deep-dish sausage pizza, I really loved the crust and the very tomato-y sauce!  I normally prefer thin crust, but I'd eat this any day.  But what really blew me away about my lunch today on Wells St was the service. We had a tall young blond man (I thought his name was "Rick," but the receipt says Jarrad) who was spot on, and the host staff was friendly and obviously well-trained too.
