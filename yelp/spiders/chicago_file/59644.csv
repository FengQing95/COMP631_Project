Smoque BBQ////Me and two of my friends arrived with some beers around 7:00pm on a Tuesday.  It was lively, busy, and smelled incredible.  Everything is ordered off a large chalkboard and seats are assigned only after you plae your order at the counter.  It's loud and cramped but I didn't mind one bit.  If you do mind, then you don't belong there as you have missed the point of what Smoque is about.  We're not there for the ambiance, you go for the food!
