Little Goat Diner////presentation. I was having a hard time not getting a sweet pancake and our server suggested a single blueberry pancake. Awesome! Got a taste for it, but glad I didn't get a full order. It was probably my least fav of the bunch. We also tried the tempura mashed potatoes. This was a unique dish that had a tasty Asian flare.
