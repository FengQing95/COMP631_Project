The Purple Pig////A Chicago dining hotspot and honestly one of the best restaurants I have ever eaten at. Period. Be warned they do not take reservations and this place is very very popular so if you come anytime close to dinner you will surely have a wait before being seated and I can only imagine waits get very long on weekends.
