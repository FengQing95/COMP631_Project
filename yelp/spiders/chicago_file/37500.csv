Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food was amazing but the waitstaff and manager on duty treated my party quite poorly. I came in with a few friends for a late dinner two nights ago and the staff indicated they needed to get some "bread in our bellies" before allowing us to order wine. Of course we were not sober but no one was being boisterous or even close to the point of needing to be cut off.
