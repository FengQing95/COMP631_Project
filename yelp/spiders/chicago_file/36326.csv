Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Probably one of our favorite restaurants in the city.  Love the BYOW option.  The gimlet on the rocks is the best I've ever had.  Steak frites is a great deal too!  The stroganoff has been good as well.  Really nice ambience - when you walk in it almost feels like a speakeasy.  They play really great hip hop music in the basement seating too.  Awesome vibe down there - really vintage and classic 1920's Chicago feeling.  Get the goat cheese appetizer too!!  It's incredible.  The shrimp and the Brussel sprouts are great too.
