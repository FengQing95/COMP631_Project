Smoque BBQ////If it weren't for the hype it MIGHT have gotten five stars, but for all the hype I was expecting something truly amazing.  Don't get me wrong, most of the items were quite good, I'd say the brisket was at the top and the pulled pork was also quite good, but the baby back ribs and some of the sides let me down a little.  A good place worth going to, but not sure it is worth a trip too far out of your way.  Saying that, I do need to get back to this place...
