Little Goat Diner////Overall a good brunch experience.  The service and ambiance were both good and my friend and I both really enjoyed our food!  I had the bulls eye french toast, which was delicious, and I can't remember what my friend ordered but he liked it a lot!  We had reservations during the week and had no trouble getting in, but I don't know how it would be on the weekend.
