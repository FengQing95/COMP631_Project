Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been here three times.  The first time on a double date w friends.  The service was great the food was ok (had a belly aches so I didn't eat much.). I went back a couple of weeks later with my guy and the food was pretty good, service was good as wells so I assumed this would be a consistently good dining choice.  I was wrong.  I went here on a Sunday night with a friend.  Who happened to bring a back pack for some God awful reason.  Anyway they seated us in the most out of the way ridiculous seating in the back of the restaurant (it wasn't crowded.). The service was sub par in that we had to ask the waiter for help repeatedly or catch him versus him being attentive and checking in.  We ordered the stuffed mushrooms (good), chicken empanadas (decent) octopus (salty- I've had better) and the beef short rib (so full of fat I sent it back!). They did graciously replace the rib but come on!?!  I really didn't enjoy this dinner.  The food was subpar and there was no presentation of the food...they basically threw it on the table.  Last time they announced the dishes and presented them for all to see.  Maybe my friend's  backpack resulted in poor service.  I have no clue but I won't be returning anytime soon.   Oh the Carmel pudding desert was great.  Should have taken a pic of that beef rib...you would be shocked.  Lol
