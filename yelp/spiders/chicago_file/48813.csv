Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been to this place a bunch of times and am so excited to give it 5 stars. The brunch, the bloodys, the sangria, Â the happy hour...its all amazing. The only time I had a bad experience here the waitress had the manager come over and comp us a round of drinks and our appetizer. Honestly, it is one of my go to spots and I cant get enough of it! Its hard to pick a favorite item, but I am a big fan of empanadas and these ones are unreal!! 5 starts to a place that really deserves it, keep it up and see you soon!!
