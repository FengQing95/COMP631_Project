Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The service was fantastic. When we sat down, the waiter greeted us, talked about his favorites, and discussed the idea of tapas since we had a newbie with us. We decided on the white sangria after much discussion. After the first pitcher was gone, we couldn't decide on what sangria to get next. Our waiter brought over a sample for us to try to decide. He was very helpful, attentive, and made sure that we were happy customers.
