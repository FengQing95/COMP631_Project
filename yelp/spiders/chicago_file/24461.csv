Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As you're all well aware, I had the distinct privilege and pleasure of dining at Giordano's just one month ago, and I gave the establishment a rave review but noted that I could not comment on the global debate as to which Windy City deep dish pizza spot reigns supreme. As fate would have it, an oncology conference brought me back to Chicago this weekend, and with it, an opportunity to sample another fan favorite. I decided to try Lou Malnati's because, among other reasons, my good friend from New York had spoken at length about the quality and taste, describing with such fervor how she abruptly awoke in the middle of the night many months after going in person, compelled by some otherworldly force to order a stifling quantity of Lou Malnati's frozen pizzas, not at all bothered by the shipping cost to NYC. Based on this review alone, I had to try it.
