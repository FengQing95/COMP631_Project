Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////btw... if you're ever in South Shore, there is nothing, nothing(!!!) like Italian Fiesta (thin). It will literally blow your mind! I swear, they must've made a pack with the Devil in order to make pizza that good! From other reviewers it seems they maybe inconsistent... but I have never found that to be the case. Â Every pizza I've ever had from them as been excellent. I must say that most of my Italian Fiesta experience took place in the 70s & 80s ---- In the last 20yrs I've eaten their pizza fewer than 10 times because I'm rarely in S. Shore, but friends who live there tell me it's good as it always was and it was certainly good during the Bear's Superbowl party in Jan'07).
