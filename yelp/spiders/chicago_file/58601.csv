Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I got together with coworkers (meeting in person for the first time!) here and we had such a great experience. The Sangria was flowing, the tapas were delicious and perfect for sharing/eating multiple courses spread out, and it was a great atmosphere! Our waiter Tim was awesome and always made sure we were taken care of without being overbearing. I will definitely be returning! Highly recommend the chorizo wrapped dates, Brussels sprouts salad, and spicy potatoes! Plus the sangria (duh)
