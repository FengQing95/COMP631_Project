Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Sunday morning, one hour wait they said.  They gave us a pager and told us it would play music if we walked out of range.  We walked a lot, kind of curious about what music would play, but heard nothing.  After 30 minutes my husband decided to go back to the hotel and check us out, while I returned to the restaurant to wait.  At 40 minutes we got paged.  They would not seat me until my husband arrived! Really? for a breakfast place?  I would have liked to get a cup of coffee and sit while waiting the few extra minutes.  Still well under the hour they gave us, he returned and we were seated.  The food more than made up for it.  Delicious coffee, wonderful omelet (goat cheese and spinach) and the fluffiest wildberry pancakes I have ever had.
