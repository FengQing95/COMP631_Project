Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////What can I say about Lou Malnati's that hasn't been said before?  The pizza was good.  It was the first thing I ate after I landed in Chicago.  We barely beat the lunch rush as we arrived right at noon on a Friday.  We were seated immediately and the service was really nice.  Our waitress was attentive.  Food was okay.  I couldn't really finish my pizza and I ALWAYS finish my pizza.  Something was just lacking in flavor, I can't really put my finger on it.  There was also a LOT of cheese.  Like, too much cheese.  How do you mess that up?  How do you have too much cheese? How do you have so much cheese that someone ends up complaining about it?  That's when you know you have too much cheese.
