Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband and I only get to Chicago a few times every couple of years... so it says something that we've booked reservations at Bavette's for both of our last two trips.  The food here is instantly and irrevocably craveable.   From the salad (oh, the bacon!) to the amazing aged steak (split this, it's HUGE), to the satisfying sides (try the corn, seriously), and finish up with a some sweets (though you'll be forcing it down by now because you'll be so full).    We loved our old-fashioned cocktails and the staff is great at recommending an accompanying wine.
