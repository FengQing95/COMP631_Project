Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Because of the wait and anticipation, especially if you've never had true deep dish pizza, your eyes might be more hungry than your stomach actually is. I would trust the menu when it says a certain pizza size feeds X amount of people. One slice is already pretty filling if you're just moderately hungry. If you're still hungry afterwards, you have a good excuse to go eat something else delicious at another one of Chi-town's many tasty eateries.
