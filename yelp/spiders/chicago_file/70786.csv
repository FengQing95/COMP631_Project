Little Goat Diner////There was only a small wait the first time and we got right in the second time.  The waitstaff was nice, but the second time it felt like we had to wait quite awhile to order which was kind of annoying because there weren't that many people there.  That's why I docked a star.  Otherwise, it was a great dining experience!  Hopefully at some point I can actually get into Girl and the Goat...
