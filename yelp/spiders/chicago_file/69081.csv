Little Goat Diner////Everything we had was solid, but not as delicious as I was expecting given the hype and the relatively long wait to get in even though we had a reservation. My bok choy slaw seemed a little bland, and my friend said the same thing about his fish tacos. Does "diner" = no zip? Maybe better to stick with with the American comfort food items on the menu than try to dishes with an Asian or Latino slant, but even the scallion pancake under my slaw was a little rubbery. The service was great. Nice atmosphere: lighting, booths, napkins, etc..
