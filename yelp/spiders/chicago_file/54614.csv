Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Dessert. 3/5. I ordered the caramelized bananas tapa. It was a nice small size - good for one person who just wants to finish off the meal with something sweet. However, it's pretty ordinary. The banana could have been warmer too. I would probably try a different dessert next time.
