Little Goat Diner////When seated we decided to order the goat chili cheese fries. The fries were pretty salty and the texture was eh- too crunchy and lacking substance. I definitely expected more. However the goat chili cheese on top was delicious! It was chunky, hearty, and had some pretty unique spices. I could see why it was 8 dollars a bowl.
