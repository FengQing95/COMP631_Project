Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Just had a delicious bday dinner here! Such a sexy dim place...it felt like we were in NY (well the people not so much but the speakeasy feel of the restaurant) As we walked in Billie Holiday (my fav) was crooning! During our 5 min wait at the bar the  drinks were  fantastic! At the table the food...OUTSTANDING! Everything came out right on time & hot! So here's what we tried: goat cheese (bread was crazy good by itself), garlic shrimp (super fresh), fried chicken (delicious), crab cake (a little to heavy on the lemon but still good), whiskey ice cream (amazing), & cheese cake (yummy). The portions were huge...thrilled we split everything! Still had doggy bags! And we had an excellent server, Michael! This joint will mos def be on heavy rotation! Well done!
