Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came here on a Saturday night, when the line was out the door and the expected wait was over an hour. Luckily, they had personal sized deep dish pizzas available for take-out, so we didn't have to wait at all, but just took the pizzas back to our hotel room! Very convenient and a good business strategy.
