The Purple Pig////Very popular place and hence rather hard to get in. But the wait for once is worth it. The menu items, which come in small portions (tapas size), are very special and not to be found anywhere else. As surprising as some of the items may sound, they all looked great (even the once on other people's plates), and the ones I could get to taste were very special, interesting flavors, and very good. No specific recommendations but would suggest to leave some space for lemon panna cotta. Casual and trendy atmosphere on the Magnificent Mile. Definitely will go back again when in Chicago.
