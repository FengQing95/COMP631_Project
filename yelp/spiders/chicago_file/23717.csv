Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We've been going to this location for years. On Saturday we went there around 1:00 for lunch. The restaurant was not full so we were seated right away. It was really  cold where they sat us and I asked the hostess if they might turn the heat up a little. I got an "are you kidding me look", and she did nothing to help. The waiter  took his sweet time getting to our table and never came back to check. We finally put in our order, but no pizza in sight. People around us who were seated later got their food, but not us. We finally got the waiter's attention and the pizza showed up about an hour after we ordered. It was semi cold. The manager came over to make some lame excuses and finally said they would not charge us. By then what we had anticipated would be a pleasant experience was ruined. We would rather have paid and gotten good service. Won't be going back to this location.
