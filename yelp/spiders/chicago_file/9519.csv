Art Institute of Chicago////There were only a few things I didn't like about the new wing. First, many of the rooms have a maze-like layout. If you're not careful you can easily miss some of the side rooms. Second, the architecture and design room has a singular entrance/exit so you have to backtrack through the room to leave; they frown on attempting to shimmy between a display case and the wall to avoid this - trust me!
