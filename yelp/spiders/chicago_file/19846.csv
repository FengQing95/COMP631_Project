Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Don't go to the touristy Giordanos! Lou Malnati's is delicious and the true chicago pizza. We went at around 5 so it wasn't too crowded yet and we didn't have to wait in a line. When we left though around 7 there was a long line out the door. We ordered the Malnati salad and the classic medium deep dish pizza for the two of us (we took a little home). The salad was good but a bit overdressed. Definitely order the dressing on the side. The pizza was delicious although in my opinion it could have been a bit cheesier! Big chunks of sausage and the sauce was thick and full of tomato pieces. We even got two frozen pizzas to take home on the plane with us. We will be returning!
