Little Goat Diner////We showed up around 11:00 AM on a Monday, and it was half empty - apparently the perfect time to be there because I have seen lines stretching down Randolph for this place.  We were initially seated at a small table that was next to a giant table full of young mothers and babies - I asked if we could sit at a booth, and the hostess could not have been nicer as she moved us. It turned out all of the babies were at a communal table, and it was funny to watch all subsequent parties who were seated near the babies request to be moved (the hostess always moved the groups).  The waiter was quite nice and attentive.  I had the omelet of the day - an egg concoction with pulled pork, barbecue sauce, and cream cheese.  I thought it was a moderately risky order, and it turned out to be pretty incredible.
