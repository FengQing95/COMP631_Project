Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered the personal size of the Malnati's Classic. Since this was my first time in Chicago, I have to get deep dish pizza. Oh man, the crust is out of this world. Its crispy on the outside and soft and flaky on the inside. I was certainly not disappointed, it exceeded my expectations. Perks of sitting at a bar: you get to meet other travelers. So great lunch place for solo travelers.
