Little Goat Diner////Thankfully, I only shared a few bites of the waffle. That way I could justify ordering dessert. The pork and toffee sundae sounded like nothing I'd ever had before, so I had to try it. And, while tasty, it was perhaps the least stand out of the dishes we tried. Not that it was BAD, oh no. It's just that it tasted largely like a toffee milkshake. The pork flavoring was subtle enough that it largely got lost amidst the other flavors.
