Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////        I don't even know where to begin with the deep dish pizza. I could easily call it one of my favorite pizzas in the world! Their tomatoes come from California, and the cheese comes from Wisconsin. It was so gooey, and just amazing! As soon as the first bite hit my taste buds, I knew I would love it!
