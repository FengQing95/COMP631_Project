Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ordered thin crust pizza last night for delivery. Had no problem at all with delivery, but the pizza was very disappointing. I haven't been back to Chicago in nearly 20 years and was so looking forward to a solid thin crust pizza. I felt like the toppings were a little lacking and the overall flavor wasn't great. Could have used more sauce too.
