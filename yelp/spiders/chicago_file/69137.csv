Little Goat Diner////I go here for breakfast and it's wonderful! My go to dish is their Bull's Eye French Toast. So good! I've actually still never been for lunch, but i'm sure it's great too. The "little goat" coffee is also excellent, which has goat milk in it. Give this place a try if you haven't yet, you won't be disappointed!
