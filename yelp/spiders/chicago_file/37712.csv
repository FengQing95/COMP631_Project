Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food is unbelievable.  I havent been to a great meal in River North in a long time and this was a great meal.  I had the salmon and of course a couple of tastings of crab cake, elote corn, and the hashbrown tater tot things...HEAVEN!  Oh sweet jesus.  They all were better than the next.  Perfect.  It was a seriously, perfectly cooked meal.
