Little Goat Diner////I was like a lazy male lion, waiting for the females to bring back the kill. As soon as the nachos were placed in front of me all I could think was "Get in my belly!" in Fatbastard's voice. They were that good. Like a midget was to Fatbastard described as "The other, other white meat," those nachos filled a void in my life I never knew existed. So yummy. So buttery. So cheesy in a goat kind of way. Â
