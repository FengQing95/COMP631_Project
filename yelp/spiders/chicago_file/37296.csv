Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Dry Aged Bone In New York Strip - (16 oz 42 day dry aged, bearnaise, steak salt) This was amazing. It was cooked to perfect and we had it sliced so it'd be easier to share. Even then there was still some meat left on the bones if you need more, but the 16oz was a great share for 2 people. Solidly executed steak.
