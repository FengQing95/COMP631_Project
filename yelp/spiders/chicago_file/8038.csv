Art Institute of Chicago////What I love most about the Art Institute of Chicago is its approachability. Â Located right at the edge of Millennium Park--in the heart of Tourist Central--it lacks any signs of pretentiousness often associated with places of fine art. One doesn't need to know where Burma is or what Impressionism means to appreciate this place and the sheer volume of work can keep even the most novice of museum-goers entertained.
