Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Perhaps I should have known better than to order a burger at a place better known for their breakfast dishes.  I was persuaded to do so by a waitress full of praise for it.  She steered me to the burger when I was torn between it and the ahi tuna wrap. She claimed she gets it for herself all the time and always orders it medium rare.
