Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Really enjoyed my food. Lots of fresh small bites that were spot on delicious. The olives were stand outs as well as the apple sherry dates.  Got for delivery, great packaging and easier to do than I was assuming.  No real misses except for the price. Absurdly expensive for the portion size. I likely wouldn't do again due to price but I had a good fresh meal.
