Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic it stood out to me because I could taste the various ingredients put into the pizza. The sauce was not too over powering and the buttery crust was delicious I didn't leave any on my plane and I am notorious for leaving my crusts behind.
