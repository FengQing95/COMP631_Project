Art Institute of Chicago////I don't know how it's possible I haven't reviewed the Art Institute yet.  I was introduced to AIC when I studied at SAIC for post-bac work (students get a free memebership) and I went there quite a lot.  This was when there was no modern wing, so yes, years ago.  Since then I have been a paying member, on and off, three or so times.  That thing pays for itself!
