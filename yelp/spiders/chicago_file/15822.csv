Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The wait time was a bit much for take-out, but it seemed longer since the only waiting area was occupied and the hosts weren't much welcoming. However, the deep dish pizza was amazing. Could've used a bit more salt and pepper. Overall, it was an amazing first time experience at a deep dish restaurant.
