Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I used to be a regular here when I lived in the neighborhood. It's been about a decade since I've dined here. Yeah I still like it, but maybe more for nostalgia. The quality of the food seems to have lost something I've the years. By no means is it bad, but I remember something a bit more special.
