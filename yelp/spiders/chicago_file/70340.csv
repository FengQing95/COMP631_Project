Little Goat Diner////The only... and I mean ONLY... thing I do NOT like about Little Goat is how long the wait is if you show up after 6pm just about any day of the week.  They don't take reservations on purpose since it's supposed to be a much more laid back, inclusive, anyone-can-eat-here kind of little sister to Girl & the Goat across the street, so play smart, people.  Go at an off time.  Like 4pm.  On a Saturday.  Sure, you won't be the coolest kid on the block, but you know what?  You won't have to wait for a table for more than ~10 minutes *AND* you'll be able to eat enough food for both lunch AND dinner AAAAND add in a dessert.  Because it's early enough to walk it off afterwards.  And their desserts are AMAZING.  Especially the blood orange meringue pie.  AHHHHHHHH... I want to go to there...
