Little Goat Diner////Came after the lunch rush and had the Mighty Goat. This burger was massive and I gotta say this is one daunting looking burger. For the meat loving carnivores, this one is for you! For me it was a fork and knife experience as I would not even try picking it up. So many layers of flavors and textures in there. Sitting at the counter and watching all the various plates of awesome food leave the kitchen, you cannot help but begin planning what to get on your next visit. Post dinner cappuccino well made and a nice way to round off a satisfying meal. I'm glad that I managed to stop by and hope to visit at least once more before leaving Chicago. Come hungry and be well fed!
