Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Overall, I enjoyed my experience but thought the food was somewhere between good and okay. There's a ton of choices so come here with a lot of people so that you can try a little bit of everything. It was worth eating here and I'd come here again, but I think I'd rather try some new/different Tapas places before coming back.
