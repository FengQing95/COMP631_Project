Little Goat Diner////The waiter was totally disinterested in us. His timing was way off and he didn't offer any help re: the menu. He asked how everything was the moment the food was set down, and ignored us when we wanted the check. I ordered the asian salad and my mom ordered the fish tostadas. The salad was terrible. No flavor. I had no idea that I was essentially ordering a huge bowl of slaw with (flavorless) shrimp in it. The tostadas were ok, but not great. We also go the glazed carrots as a side. Those were probably the best thing we ate and they were just a tiny side portion. Its so so loud in this place you can't hear anyone talk.
