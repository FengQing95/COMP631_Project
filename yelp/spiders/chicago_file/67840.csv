Little Goat Diner////Not as sophisticated and trendy as Girl and the Goat, but certainly, if not almost, as crazily creative and in a good way. There's something for every palate, especially if the diner ignores the huge amount of butter, oil or grease and sodium is used to make each dish. Everything from sandwiches, to pork belly, to mac and cheese, to the oh so greasy and delicious fries are wonderful. The only ho hum aspect to the meal are the desserts, which are commonplace, yet good and sweet.
