Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We made reservations for the evening before Thanksgiving, and we were seated immediately even though we were about ten minutes early for the 6PM slot.  We chomped on fresh crusty bread with olive oil as we perused the extensive menu.  We went for the half-pitcher of The Classic White Sangria and it was refreshing.  Note that the sangria comes with paper straws, which may clog up with bits of fruit but work fine with a bit of maintenance.
