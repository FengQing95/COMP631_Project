Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When we checked in with the hostess, she told us to sit on the bench behind the hostess area.  We waited about another 15 minutes (figuring this was part of the 45 minute wait).  When my husband asked the hostess how much longer - she said were were supposed to "tell the lady" we were here for our table.  We had no idea what lady she was talking about and finally someone else helped us and got us a table.
