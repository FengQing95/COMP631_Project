The Purple Pig////Immediately after seeing it carried past our table, we knew we had to start with the tuna tartare [$24]. Its unique, eye-catching presentation revealed a generous and tasty portion of tuna, with an uncommon touch of pistachio adding texture to the dish. We also tried the popular crispy pig's ear [$19]. From sisig to liang ban mala zhu er, pig's ear is one of the most underrated portions of meat, and definitely one of my favorites due to its addictive taste, so I was excited to see The Purple Pig's interpretation. I had mixed feelings on this dish- it worked well as a snackable item and was objectively tasty and fun to eat, but I felt that perhaps something was missing, and I wish that there had been more textural contrast between the crispy-fried texture and the slightly crunchy yet gelatinous texture of pig's ears. In the end, it was tasty but this preparation didn't knock my socks off.
