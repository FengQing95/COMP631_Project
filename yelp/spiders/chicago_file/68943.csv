Little Goat Diner////This is one of my favorite spots. Whether you are grabbing an appetizer or milkshake or dinner with friends, it is a great hangout. The service is also fast and the food will never disappoint. I always get the Dairy-Free chocolate milk shake and the crab dip (served with Ritz crackers).
