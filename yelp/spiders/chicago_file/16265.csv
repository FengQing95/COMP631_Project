Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pizza: Got a 1/2 pepperoni & 1/2 sausage pizza with mushrooms and green peppers. The crust is soooooo good and buttery! and the sauce is on the sweeter side...takes some getting use to. The bf and I ordered a small and we were each only able to eat a slice after our appetizers.
