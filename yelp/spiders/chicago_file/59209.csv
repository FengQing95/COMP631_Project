Smoque BBQ////All winter long I had heard of Smoque BBQ: first on the Food Network and next on "Check Please!" When the weather started to turn, the call of barbeque was simply too strong to resist.  I started looking for excuses to travel to Irving Park to gorge myself on sumptuous barbeque.  I finally got my chance this last week.
