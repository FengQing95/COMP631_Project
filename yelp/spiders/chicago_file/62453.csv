Smoque BBQ////We went here before the lunch rush and walked right up to the register and placed our order. Since it was my first visit I wanted to try everything and they made the menu so you could by ordering "tastes" for $3 each. I ordered a full slab of baby backs and a taste of pulled pork and beef brisket. Yes I ate it all. My son got a brisket platter with 2 sides.The baby back ribs are so good no sauce is required. Whatever rub they put on the ribs would be drowned out by the sauce IMO. The pulled pork was moist and had a great flavor (the rub again ?) The brisket was lean and perfectly cooked but lacked flavor, this is where the sauce comes in handy. Next time I go I'm getting the mac 'n cheese that my son recommended to me. They cook it in it's own little tin container and it's so good. The Smoque BBQ sauce didn't work for me, but like I said it may not be needed. I love Heckys sauce. Â
