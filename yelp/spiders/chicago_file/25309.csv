Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We sat at the bar and talked with other Floridians and a wonderful woman from Atlanta. Tried the Bruschetta one if them shared with us....YUM! The deep dish pizza was fantastic! Â I still prefer a thin crust (which they do serve) only because low carb has converted me to as little bread as possible. Great place and worth several visits.
