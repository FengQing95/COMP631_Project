Little Goat Diner////We were visiting Chicago from out of state and we ate here 3 out of the 4 days that we were in town. All for the Okonomiyake. That thing is damn good! The pancake is perfectly moist! We ordered 1 to share for the first 2 times, but each had to get our own the third time. The goat chili was a good compliment to the dish. It's way easier to get reservations here. We never got a chance to eat across the street at the Girl and the Goat. It was a blessing though because I thoroughly enjoyed each meal that I had here.
