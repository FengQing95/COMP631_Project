Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went here during restaurant week and when i got inside and saw the menu restaurant week menu went out the door.  I wanted to try the whole menu.  Our server recommended several dishes and they were all amazing.  My fave thing to get are the bacon wrapped dates they are a must try.  The seasonal sangria and the red sangria were very delicious. The watermelon salad was amazing as well.  You can't go wrong with this place order anything you won't be disappointed.
