Smoque BBQ////Just insanely good BBQ. I had it a few weeks ago and can't stop thinking about it. The ribs were fantastic both with and without sauce. All of the sides like cornbread and mac and cheese were hot and tasty. My father saw this place on Food Network and wanted to try it when he was in town. We were not disappointed. I need to go back soon.
