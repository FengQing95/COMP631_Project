Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was on a visit to Chicago from the West Coast and got a chance to try the deep dish from Lou Malnati's. It wasn't the best Chicago deep dish I've ever had, but it was definitely memorable! We ordered 'the Lou' and 'the Deluxe', both really good! I will definitely want to try and stop by again if I'm ever back in town!
