Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Expensive and tasteless- that includes the food and the coffee. Â I am guessing my giant mug was mostly milk. Won't be back here again. The wait was long for food service and the bus boy threw away my kid's toddler fork that I had brought. I guess it's quick and ignorant clean up though I have to admit, after being there so long, I was itching to get out.
