Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We walked through the doors and across from the main doors was a brick wall with Bavette's imprinted on it. I was getting even more excited. The ambiance was already going in the right direction. The hostess was ready for us and told us to step through the door and to wait for someone to seat us.
