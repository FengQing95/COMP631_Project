Smoque BBQ////This place is ok. The brisket was very tender, but you really need the sauce, otherwise there isn't a whole lot of flavor there. And the sauce is hit or miss. They eyeball it when making it, so sometimes it is perfect, other times it is wayyyy to acidic. Went on a Thursday afternoon and there was pretty much no wait.
