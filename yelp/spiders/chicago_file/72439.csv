Little Goat Diner////Service: the Elvis waffles came promptly but it took another 15 minutes for the plain bagel to arrive (strange)....By the time I received the bagel, my partner had nearly finished his waffles. Wah Wah. We tried to find our server whilst we were looking for the bagel, but he had completely disappeared. Did I mention our coffees did not get filled once? Not once.
