Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'll start off by saying, the wait is real at Malnati's! I arrived at quarter to 8pm on a Wednesday night needing just a seat for me. There was a 30 minute wait. Their process is innovative where you place your pizza order first while you wait, and by the time you're seated your pizza should be ready because of the long cooking process of the crust and pizza.
