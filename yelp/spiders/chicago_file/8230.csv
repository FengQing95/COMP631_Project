Art Institute of Chicago////this museum is ginormous!!  or maybe my feet felt like it was cuz of all the walking.  there are three levels with different wings.  downstairs is the children's discovery corner where they have miniature displays.  some tiny rooms had such great detail...looked like chateau de versailles' room in louis XIV.
