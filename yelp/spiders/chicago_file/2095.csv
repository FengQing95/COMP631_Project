Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Now I've scampered through a large chunk of PA, DE, MD, and NJ, so I like to think I've had some quality brunches... However, on a road trip with my best friend, we decided to give this place a chance after reading some rave reviews, AND OH BOY... I'm so glad we went here! We decided to go all out or nothing and order four items... Espanola omelette (it was basically a glorified taco flavored omelette of goodness), strawberry cream cheese stuffed French toast, cinnamon roll pancakes, and the Berry Bliss crepes. All were fabulous and were finished between two hungry college students. However, we tried the crepe and were not a fan... Our waitress (her name slips my mind) was wonderful and constantly came by to check on us despite how busy the whole restaurant was and when we told her we didn't like the crepe, she took the plate and took it off our tab! I worked at a coffee shop for five months so I'm extra attentive to customer service and our's was wonderful. My cup was never empty and our plates were taken away and all the servers were smiling and it helped create an enjoyable atmosphere. It's been months since my friend and I have been here but we still talk about our brunch experience... It was pretty holy, to be honest. Overall, I'd recommend to ANYONE that comes to Chicago. However, we did come on a Sunday afternoon so there was an hour and twenty minute long wait... So don't show up super hungry or you might leave grouchy before you're even seated. Keep that mind. The wait is so worth it, trust me. This is my #1 place to visit when I come back!
