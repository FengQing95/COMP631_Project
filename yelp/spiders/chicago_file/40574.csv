Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This experience will come with a price tag, but totally worth it. As a side note, If you aren't from Chicago, they do charge a COVID % fee to your check. I think it's about 5% of your total but don't quote me on that. Im not sure how long places in Chicago will be doing that but just FYI.
