Smoque BBQ////You all should be jealous, I work a block away from Smoque and get to smell the wonderful aroma as it drifts through the neighborhood.  Now, I am not a bbq expert, but this food is consistently top notch.  The fact that there are lines is a testament to the fact that the Exec. Chef. knows what he is doing.  Add to that on many occasions he is walking around the dining room chatting with the customers.
