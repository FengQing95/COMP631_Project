Little Goat Diner////Quite simply, the Tuna Melt is one of the best dishes I've ever had in my life! Sourdough toasted and served open faced with flaked tuna, sliced hard boiled egg, a Mornay cheese sauce and topped with a perfect Nicóise salad of Frisée, pickled onion, olives, and blanched green beans. It was a perfect combination of flavors and textures. A steal at $13.
