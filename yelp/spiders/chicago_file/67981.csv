Little Goat Diner////Don't believe the hype, there are way better places. Waited more than an hour to pay too much for bad food. They were out of what we wanted, so we had to settle for 2nd choice. I don't understand Izard's obsession with goat. I like goat meat when prepared well, but the sloppy goat was just awful. The salads were even worse. We were completely underwhelmed by the burger. Kids' size Mac 'n cheese was half the size of kids' portions at any other restaurant. The root vegetable side was meh. All we had that was really good were potatoes--which are kind of hard to mess up. I do like the little take-out area on the side, however.  Good bread, coffee, tea, and the best $3 oatmeal-to-go I've ever had.  This oatmeal alone is worth one star--the main restaurant fall short and only gets two.
