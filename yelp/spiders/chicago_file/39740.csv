Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////On top of the incredible food, one of the best things about coming to Bavette's is that it's a BYOB. Their policy is that if you bring your own wine, you have to share a glass with another table. It's fun scouting the restaurant and picking a table to receive your "corkage fee"...or if that's not your cup of tea you can just have the waiter deliver the glass at his or her discretion.
