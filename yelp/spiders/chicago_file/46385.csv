Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have fun every time I eat at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!  You can try so many new things--different cheeses, differently prepared meats, and the bacon dates are outstanding.  The white sangria is refreshing...all the sangrias are good.  I like to take our of town guests here (and we can avoid the usual tourist spots).  They even offer gluten-free options on their menu!
