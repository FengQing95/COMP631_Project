Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I will admit, I have had dishes here that weren't that great, but that is one out of then ten dishes I loved, and I refuse to judge this place by one bad dish, even when they replaced it with another great dish for no charge and even brought desert to us for no charge due to the mishap.
