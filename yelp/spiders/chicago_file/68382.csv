Little Goat Diner////The atmosphere of the entire place is very cute, I wish the bakery part was a bit bigger with more seating and the diner is fancy, yet casual at the same time. It looked very nice so they did a great job with it. Now if they work on those diner menu items to make them more appealing to yours truly, I'll be back.
