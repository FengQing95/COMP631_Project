Little Goat Diner////I got the recommended Los Drowned sandwich. I thought it was good, not amazing. The braised beef was borderline dry and my order did not come out looking like the the other pictures. My sandwiched looked sloppily put together and then plated. The order came with just a sandwich, no sides. For a $14 sandwich, most restaurants would at least offer a small side along with the order. My boyfriend got the Reuben sandwich which he says was also decent.
