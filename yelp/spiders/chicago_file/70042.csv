Little Goat Diner////My past 2 experiences were great and I was constantly raving about Little Goat and Stephanie Izard's talent. However, this time I ordered the reuben and it was very average. It had housemade Kraut but it was pickled for too long, I had to pick mine off my sandwich. Further, parts of the corned beef were incredibly overcooked.  Our server was also pretty MIA, we had to stop her a couple times to get water refills, etc because she was not attentive.
