Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Found this place nearby the holiday inn mart plaza even though it wasn't on their list of recommendations. It was packed and you needed reservations but when I told them I was from out of town they found me a place at the bar. I ordered the filet mignonette 10 oz and buttered potatoes. The server was helpful and very friendly in spite of the heavy crowd. I was very impressed by the customer service and when food arrived all I can say is wow! The filet was cooked to perfection and the bet side sauce was the best I have had since I was in Europe! The buttered potatoes were excellent too. The price was a bit high but for the quality of food I got it was worth it. Highly recommend!
