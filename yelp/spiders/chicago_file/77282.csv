Little Goat Diner////We approve of Little Goat! After much deliberation, we went with the Bull's Eye French Toast (Rosemary French Toast, with an ooey gooey egg hidden inside, topped with crispy fried chicken, strawberries and syrup) paired with crispy hash browns, filled with white cheddar cheese. Adorable spot, great team (all smiles), and the best place to sit is at the counter where you can see everyone's order come out and *drool* while you wait!
