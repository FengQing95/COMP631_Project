Little Goat Diner////Ive been to Girl and Goat before so I wasn't really sure what to expect. I had made reservations on Open Table and it was nice that they gave you the option of standard seating vs at the bar. The diner was really cute and I noticed the little details on the plates as well as the napkins on the table. I had the okonomiyaki and my brother had the Goat Almighty. Both were really good (my brother had me try a little bit of his). I've never had okonomiyaki before but I saw a video of Chef Izard preparing it so I was definitely curious after that. It was a savory pancake and it was light and fluffy. It was topped with an egg, fried tempura batter sprinkles and sauce. The burger had 4 layers of meat. It had 1 thick beef patty on the bottom then 2 layers of the braised beef and topped with the pork. I tried both meats and they really complemented each other even though their flavors were so contrasting. The smoked fries were also very addicting considering I don't like fries! For dessert, I ordered the One Twisted Sundae and my brother got the Coffee root beer float. The Sundae had salted caramel ice cream on top of a brownie and mixed in with candied pretzels. It was really good but also very sweet. My brother just devoured his Rootbeer float so I'm guessing he enjoyed it as well! Â It was a great spot to stop in for a late lunch. I'm curious to try the dinner menu which I think is available starting at 5 pm.
