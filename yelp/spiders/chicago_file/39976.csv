Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////There are so many menu offerings that appeal to us so we tend to order plates to share. Our favorite sides to share include the elote style corn (do yourself a favor and order two if you're sharing!), truffle mac and cheese, thick-cut bacon, and the pommes frites with garlic aioli. To be fair, we don't feel you can go wrong with any of the side offerings!
