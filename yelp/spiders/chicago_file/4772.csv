The Purple Pig////Purple Pig is a tapas kind of place (so be nice and share) with very unique menu items. The most popular dish to get is the milk braised shoulder, it's very tender and flavorful. Roasted beets were a surprisingly good dish with the pistachio butter being a great complement to the beets. Crispy pig ears were a bit of a disappointment though; they tasted more like fried onions that were oversalted and the kale, egg, and whatever else didn't help with the taste either. To top it all off (or to start it all off), we got a pig platter of cured meats since we love prosciutto or chorizo sausage and the like.
