Little Goat Diner////I was greeted by super friendly staff and was directed to the menu. The to go menu isn't as large as the diner menu (which looks amazing by the way!) but rightfully so. So even with just a few sandwich choices, I was torn between all of them. I finally settled on their most popular and admittedly my first inclination and went with the shrimp sandwich.
