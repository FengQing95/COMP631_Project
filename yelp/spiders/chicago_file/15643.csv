Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our waiter took over 10 minutes to bring our menus and then another 10 minutes just to take our drink orders. After waiting over 5 minutes for him to bring me a drink, I began to look around for him. I found him in the kitchen talking to another waiter - all the while carelessly holding our drinks in his hands.
