Little Goat Diner////Had a great brunch at Little Goat on a Friday morning/afternoon.  We had reservations for 1:30 and I am glad we did.  The place was packed and there was a wait, but I am not sure how long it was.  We were there 60-90 minutes and it stayed hopping the entire time.  But, we were seated promptly.  So, make a reservation if possible.
