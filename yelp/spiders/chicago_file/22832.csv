Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came here at 9am at on a sunday and still had to wait 45 mins-1 hour to get seated.  Luckily we were able to order while we waited.  We got the the Malnati Chicago classic with Lou's lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust.  The butter crust was AMAZING! The night before I was disappointed with with Gino's East crust but this did not disappoint!  It was so cheesy and juicy!   I was in heaven!  We also got the Chocolate chip pizza.  A freshly baked chocolate chip cookie prepared in a deep dish pizza pan, topped with vanilla bean ice cream and whipped cream.  There was WAY more ice cream than we expected but we were happy none the less.  This is what chicago pizza should be!
