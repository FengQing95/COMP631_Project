Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I had always assumed Chicago deep-dish pizzas were monstrous, but I was actually surprised to find that it was not as I had assumed.  The pizzas are good-sized, but not the behemoths I had always imagined.  Don't get me wrong though - they are really filling!  3 slices and you'll be stuffed.
