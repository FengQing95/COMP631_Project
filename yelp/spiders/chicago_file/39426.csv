Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My boyfriend and I loved our experience here. All staff were friendly and kind to us. The food was incredible. The restaurant itself had a lovely ambience. We put our names in and walked the river walk (which is about a block away) while we waited a hour for our table (it was so worth the wait). We got the rib eye steak, lobster, crab cakes, cream spinach, baked sweet potato and carrot cake for dessert. Thank you Bavette for reminding us how special dinner dates can be!
