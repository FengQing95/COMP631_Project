Little Goat Diner////Bull's Eye French Toast - I would say this was the weakest item that we ordered. It was French toast with an egg in the middle of each piece of bread, topped with fried chicken and BBQ syrup. If you're into this sort of thing you may love it, but I found it to be bland compared to the other dishes we ordered.
