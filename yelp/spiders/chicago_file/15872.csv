Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Well - in person it's even better. It's hot, fresh, and the crust and sausage is to DIE for. There's something about the crust that's flaky and amazing (probably TONS of butter). We ordered a large Malanati's special which is basically crust sauce cheese and sausage. We had 1/3 of a pie left over after we all had 2 slices. I'm going to try and smuggle it back to Austin in my carryon.
