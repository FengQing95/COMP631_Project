Little Goat Diner////Decent outdoor, great for people watching. Good veggie burger, alley smoke was nice (it's a drink). They messed up and did a beef burger instead and it took a hell of a time for them to refire the right order. They comped it so that was good but damn, it took a long time. Would check it out again and just keep my fingers crossed they got it right on try one.
