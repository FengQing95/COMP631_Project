Little Goat Diner////Let me preface this by saying that I heart Stephanie Izard immensely. I'd eat whatever she cooks; she can make a hard boiled egg and I'd enjoy it (although if there's anyone that can turn a hard boiled egg into something terrific it's her). The recent opening of the "Little Goat" provided another opportunity to enjoy her cooking; I was relieved today to have finally snagged a table at this place.
