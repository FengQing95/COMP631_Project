Smoque BBQ////And speaking of portions, I thought it was interesting a friend of mine ordered the large salad, since I was surprised how enormous it was! It was so big that it could be shared with 2-3 people, depending on how much or little one wants to eat, so I'd advise ordering a small salad if you want salad to yourself. Another friend of mine ordered the fries, and I like that you do get a generous portion of fries, but not too much. Finally, how can I forget to mention the crowds? They were so much, that whenever I come back, I'll hit this place outside of their dinner rush, and likely get their food to go instead. Too little seating for all the crowds they get.
