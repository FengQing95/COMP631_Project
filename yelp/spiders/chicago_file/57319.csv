Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I had some high expectations about this place because people rave about it. But honestly it's just basic Spanish tapas. Nothing new or exciting. I mean it taste fine but you can pretty much get the same tapas at any other Tapas restaurant. But I guess if you want to be part of the "scene" and you enjoy eating at places where you have to talk really loud and have a hard time hearing what your companions are saying then have at it ! I did love the flan with the saffron caramel. That was delicious. Other than that I think the price was fair and the service was good. Also was disappointed in the lack of vegan options so I don't know why this was tagged as having vegan options because everything either had dairy or meat.
