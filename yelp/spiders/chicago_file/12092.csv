Art Institute of Chicago////My mother brought me to The Art Institute of Chicago since I was a child. Memories of being among great art go way way back :-) it always seems like time standstill when you're walking the galleries. Must see for anyone who's visiting Chicago or even for people who live here and just need a day of fine art.
