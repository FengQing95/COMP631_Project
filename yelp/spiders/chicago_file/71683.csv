Little Goat Diner////Menu: really impressed at all the fun twists on such otherwise basic and classic foods. I had the fat Elvis (with regular maple syrup as I am a vegetarian) with a side of hash browns. And my friend chose a vegetarian party melt with the tempura potatoes on the side. I was overall impressed with my waffles thought the peanut butter butter was PHENOM.. Loved my hash browns EXCEPT--- I found a HAIR in them... Towards the end of eating them I found it, so at that point I felt silly. I was going to tell the server but he came and grabbed the almost empty palate before I could stop to show him--- at that point I felt dumb saying "oh by the way, the plate you got rid of had a hair".. In hindsight I probably should have said something. My friend loved her food as well. Had we not been stuffed we may have tried a dessert, maybe next time.
