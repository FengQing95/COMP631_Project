Smoque BBQ////The atmosphere is also very much contrived.  It's something between a poorly planned lunch room cafeteria and a Chili's.  The wanna-be 'down-home' charm of rickety tables and too-close for comfort rib sucking is lost on me in a sea of table Nazi's demanding where you sit, excruciatingly blaring audibility and an overall frenzied environment.  It always seems like nobody really knows what's going on and it's not uncommon for someone to be moving tables back and forth throughout the restaurant while you're eating.  As well, it's nice that the owner walks around checking on his customers, but I am left to wonder: Is he strolling the restaurant to check on customers or is he just hoping someone still recognizes him from chillin' with TGIF-Friday's-Sling' Guy Fieri from the Food Network?  Burn.
