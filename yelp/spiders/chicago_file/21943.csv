Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My boyfriend and I were visiting Chicago from New York and figured we would try the famous deep dish pizza. The waiting area was packed but we ended up with only a 15 minute wait. We decided on calamari as an app and the Lou because of all of the yummy pictures that were posted. Our server immediately asked us for our drink order. We were sitting next to a very large party so it was quite loud but that's not the restaurants fault. Drinks were delivered quickly and the appetizer arrived in a decent amount of time. Then came the pizza. Being from NY (home of the best pizza in the world), I wasn't expecting much but I have to say, the sauce is great! The crust could've used a little more salt but it wasn't bad. We had a good experience and I would definitely go back if I'm ever in town again.
