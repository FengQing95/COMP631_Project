Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is another of Hosalt group's wonderful expressions, this being what they feel a french steak house should be - and they are 100% spot on. The ambiance is pleasant with great wood and mirrored walls and even have rich oxblood-colored leather booths. The cocktails are as great as you'd expect from Hogsalt. My recommendations here are the seafood tower and the aged steak. While this can come across as "just another Chicago steak house", it truly is more than that as indicated by months long wait list. You really will not be disappointed with Bavette's in any way shape or form.
