Smoque BBQ////When we arrived at Smoque BBQ, there was huge line spanning out of the restaurant.  We had to wait about 45 minutes to an hour to order our food.  Once our food was ordered it only took about 5 - 10 min for our food to be ready.  The atmosphere reminds me of a busy/hectic train station.  It's very loud and jam packed.  The tables are arranged in sort of long picnic table array, or in other words you'll probably end up sitting next to a couple/group that you don't know which was a little uncomfortable at first when our food wasn't ready.
