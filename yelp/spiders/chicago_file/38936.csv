Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This a perfect place for a date night or an intimate dinner with friends. The ambience is hipster cool with a little bit of old school classic steakhouse. The portions are extremely generous so keep that in mind when ordering. The truffle mac and cheese was awesome. We both had a tender well cooked filet mignon and ended dinner with an epic slice of lemon meringue. The meringue was mile high and the lemon portion had the texture of a key lime custard base. My advice is to wear stretchy pants when you go.
