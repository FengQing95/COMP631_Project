Little Goat Diner////Our waitress Raquel was great, very friendly and attentive. They definitely have the service portion down at Little Goat. The menu is pretty massive, but we perused during our wait. Gina A. was SET on the crumpets. Glad we went with her intuition, they were fantastic and came with this amazing blueberry preserve. We also went with the hot crab dip which was so tasty! We all really enjoyed this. I thought the star of our side dishes was the tempura mashed potatoes. What could be bad about fried mashed potatoes? They came in two large blocks and with a really tasty sriracha-like sauce.
