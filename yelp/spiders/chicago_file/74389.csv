Little Goat Diner////Good but not great.  My Fat Club fell flat on flavor.  The Bull's Eye French Toast portion was much smaller than expected.  I was picturing a larger portion of more traditional fried chicken.  The nachos were the star of the afternoon.  The house made chips stayed crispy and the topping proportions were on point.
