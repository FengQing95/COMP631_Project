Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our absolute go to is the steak tare tare and crab cake, for apps. For entrees we have had the filet, fried chicken and pork chop. Surprisingly I think the Pork Chop was my favorite! The staff was so incredibly kind and accommodating, based on these three important criteria: timeliness, accuracy, and consistency. But to the biggest delight was the level of service they offered every customer in the resraurant. We last came here for our engagement dinner celebration and they treated us like we were dining royalty! Attached is a Instagram snap from that night and got much praise from our followers. We highly recommend for special occasions or a random dinner for two. Both ways, you will get consistency and satisfaction from every part of tge dining exoereince.
