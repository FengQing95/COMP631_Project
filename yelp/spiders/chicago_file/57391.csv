Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Upon entering, you are greeted by the lead hostess.  She was very pleasant and we (3 people in my group) were seat in the bar area immediately.  The server was pleasant.   Since I'm not that familiar with Spanish food, my buddies ordered various entrees to share.  The menu had a lot of various selections to choose from.
