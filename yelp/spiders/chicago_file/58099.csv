Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! is perfect for special occasions. Prepare to spend a lot of money here because it's hard not to try everything on the menu and share with good company. And it's hard not to try the paellas (which serves 4). And it's hard not to order a pitcher (or three) the white peach sangria. The Bloody Mary bar is rad. The quality here is worth every penny.
