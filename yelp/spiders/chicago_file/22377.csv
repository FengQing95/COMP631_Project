Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Sadly a bad experience at the River North location. I usually enjoy Lou Malnotti's, but everything about this visit was bad to worse. The wait was well over the hour I was told, finally received the "text" after it seemed like an eternity of constantly refreshing the web address to see what number position we were and then seated outside. Ok, I admit I said outside was fine....but, that was almost an hour and a half ago, now it's cool out that it's nightfall and you see I have two kids in tow. Whatever, just want to eat and go. Corner table outside, closest to where the group of guys are smoking...are you effing kidding me??!!! I address this to our server and she kindly tells the guys no smoking there, ok, great, Thanks!
