Smoque BBQ////No Bbq place in all of Chicago can stand up to this place! The Ribs here are the best I ever had.Im serious! I had Bbq in Memphis,And Texarkana,ak.And they dont even come close to Smoque.The rub that they use is the best! You dont even need Bbq sauce.They are that good without it! The brisket is super tender,and cooked to perfection! The mac and cheese is really good.The beans are great! And my god,The slaw is the best around.For like 8 to 13 bucks each,You can eat like a king! you get half a slab of ribs,and two sides,and slaw for like ten bucks.I usually add a side of brisket for like an extra 3 bucks.And you get your moneys worth! I can talk forever about this place.The usually have a long line.But if you go later in the evening,you can get lucky and get a table without having a ton of people around you.But I usually just call it in and take it home.    This place is worth a long drive,worth a long line.Im telling you,THE BEST IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO.If you dont believe me,ASK JESUS!
