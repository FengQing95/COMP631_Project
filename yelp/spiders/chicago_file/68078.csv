Little Goat Diner////Amazing. Not your typical diner. 20 minute wait for outdoor seating on a Saturday brunch time- not too shabby. The outdoors is great but the inside is big and beautiful for a diner. The food was so good my entire table was quiet eating for a solid 15 minutes just devouring their meals. Our drinks were yummy (I had the Moscow mule $11). Not too strong and delicious. My meal was the Brandade Pork Belly with eggs. Unbelievably good. I never thought I'd love mixing fish, pork and eggs and biscuit- but every piece was so delicious I ate every bite. Final bill with tip- $30 per person. Standard price for a high quality breakfast. I'll take all my visitors here.
