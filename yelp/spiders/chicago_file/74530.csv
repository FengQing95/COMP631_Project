Little Goat Diner////Looks, smells, feels like a diner. Even the menu resembles a diner, but everything has a nice tasty twist. I start salivating just thinking about Little Goat. Their Elvis Waffles, with PB, Chocolate, Bananas and BACON is to die for. Think about all of those ingredients, mixed together in every bite. Then there's their Pork Belly, Korean Pancake, which although the belly is very rich, is balanced with some great slaw and a bready pancake. The only let down that night was maybe the mac and cheese, which was a little runny.
