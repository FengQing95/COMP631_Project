Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////kidding). Just a side note- you do not have to pay for Chicago Street parking on Sunday in this area. Anyways, I thought for sure we would wait long to be seated because the place was slammed. But then the host advised us to follow her and we were immediately seated. This place is like a maze, with so different sections. The waiter greeted us almost immediately and listed out the drink specials for the evening. There are no menus, you basically just use your phone to "take a picture" and then the menu appears. There is so much selection to choose from but my husband and I chose the Brussel sprouts salad with marcona almonds and Manchego, two orders of the peri- peri chicken, an order of the grilled hanger steak, shrimp with garlic,
