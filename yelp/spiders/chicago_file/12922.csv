Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I am not much of a pizza eater, but my hubby is so I am forced to eat it. This is probably the best pizza I have had.  We only ate at this location a few times, we mainly ordered fron the one in Orland and the one in the south loop on State Street.  They have the BEST thin crust pizza.  It just melts in your mouth.  Their deep dish is pretty tasty as well, but as I mentioned, I am not much of a pizza eater so the thin crust is about how far I am willing to go.  P.s my hubby recommends the deep dish with the butter crust.
