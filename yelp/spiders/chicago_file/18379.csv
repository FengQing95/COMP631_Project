Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our party of 6 arrived early and placed our name on the list for a table- when we did this we also "placed our pizza order" or so we thought- upon being seated we were told by the pushy waiter that he would then put the order in- odd.  We ordered an appetizer and salad also- something to note, the salads are HUGE!! Our group of 6 barely made a dent in the serving!
