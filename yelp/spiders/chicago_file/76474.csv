Little Goat Diner////- They were so busy for Sunday brunch, we checked in for our reservation a few minutes our time and they said they were cleaning the table. 15-20 minutes later, we still weren't called and when I checked in the girl looked over at the table which was clean and empty and apologized. Understand it was busy but would have been nice if they would have offered us something extra or off of our bill for the wait. We had bags with us so should have been apparent that we were off to the airport right after.
