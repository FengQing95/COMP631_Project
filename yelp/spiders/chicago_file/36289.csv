Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I came here for dinner and drinks on a Wednesday night and had a great meal.  The drinks were well made and delicious.  My first order was a Tuxedo #2; when the bartender didn't know how to make it, he looked up the recipe and made an excellent cocktail.  The remainder of the night I drank gin martinis, which were also well done.
