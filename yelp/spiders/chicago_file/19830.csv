Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you are visiting Chicago for the first time, you MUST go here. We are staying at the Beat Western in River Front and the parking employee recommended this place for a good classic Chicago Deep Dish pizza. I went here last night. The wait was supposed to be 25 minutes but we found two seats at the bar and skipped the wait! The bartenders were very nice and accommodating hence the busy night they had. We ordered a mule (custom with triple sec) and Goose IPA for drinks and got the classic deep dish pizza from the restaurant and really enjoyed it! I thought it was nice how they warned us that the deep dish would take 40 minutes and we in return ordered some more beers to enjoy the wait. The pizza was amazing. I would recommend getting a smaller size than you are used to for regular pizza because this deep dish stuff is very filling. I usually eat a good amount of food and could finish a regular medium size pizza without lifting a muscle but with this medium the two of us still had two pieces left over!
