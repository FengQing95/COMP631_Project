Little Goat Diner////Everything that I could say has already been said.  I had the Little Goat equivalent to Eggs Benedict.  The use of brandade instead of hollandaise was GENIUS.  The kimchi made a perfect counterpoint to all of that richness.  The biscuit was so fluffy and delicious.  The cocktails were tasty. I was totally into it.
