Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////EVERYTHING we ordered was delicious. We shared a wedge salad - best bacon I've ever tasted. I had the salmon and my bf ordered the petit filet mignot. Both were tender and seasoned perfectly. We shared the elote style corn, truffle Mac and cheese and charred broccoli; each wonderfully prepared.
