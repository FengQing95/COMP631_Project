Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I had the Tiramisu pancakes, and they were among the most decadent things in the history of breakfast, almost TOO much even.  Service was incredibly friendly, despite the huge crowd.  I plan on going back next time I'm in Chicago, because there were just too many creative things on this menu that I want to try.
