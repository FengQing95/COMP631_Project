Smoque BBQ////Really really disappointed after my trip to Smoque. After spending some time in Austin I was able to taste some truly great bbq and Smoque would be laughed out of town down there. I was hankering some good brisket and was dismayed to find it extremely greasy and worst of all the crust was TERRIBLE. Perhaps my favorite part of a good sliced brisket is the smoky peppery & salty outtery crust. Smoque's crust (if you can call it that) has zero flavor and no snap to it. Really shocked that this is supposedly Chicago's best BBQ in such a good food town. Great BBQ has made its way to NYC you'd think Chicago could get some of the same love.
