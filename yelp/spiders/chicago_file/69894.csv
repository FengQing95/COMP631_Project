Little Goat Diner////2.  Korean Burger - sides ala carte.  My wife ordered a Mac & Cheese side. She enjoyed the burger, which she said was way too much food and the Kimchi too bland.  She also liked the Mac & Cheese, but observed that the portion was shareable.  That said, my wife said she preferred the burgers at The Burger Bar or the Lockdown Bar and Grill (Kuma's Corner, not so much).
