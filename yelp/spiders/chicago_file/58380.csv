Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago! I took my girlfriend here to celebrate her birthday and we had an amazing dining experience. The waiter, Chad, did a great job of recommending foods and making sure we were always taken care of. The food was phenomenal. We ordered patatas bravas, beef hangar skewers, seared txistorra sausage, shrimp with garlic, watermelon sangria, paella mixta, and the butter scotch flan. Every single dish was delicious and flavorful. The patatas bravas came with a spicy tomato aoili that complimented the potatoes well, and added a nice kick of heat to the dish. The potatoes were crispy and cooked perfectly. The beef hangar skewers were cooked to a perfect medium rare. They were juicy and tender and the horse radish sour cream elevated the natural flavor of the beef exquisitely. The sausage was similar to chorizo, but better! It came with a pickled mustard seeds that added a great zesty acidic element to the dish. The shrimp was by far the best shrimp I ever had. It was cooked perfectly and wasn't too chewy. The garlic and the peppers gave the shrimp a delicious unique flavor and the garlic was nice and saut√©ed, it was tasty too. We went with the waiters recommendation of trying the daily special of watermelon sangria and we're happy we did. It tasted like juice! It was very sweet and fruity just how I like. The paella was the best part of the meal. It had so many different layers of flavor with the soft green peppers, moist falling apart pork, juicy chicken thigh, and delectable salchichon. The rice was cooked to perfection and was full of flavor. We ended the meal with the butter scotch flan recommended by the waiter. It was the perfect ending to the meal and it was a good portion for 2 people. We ended the meal feeling full, but not hating ourselves for overeating and we felt like we tried so many different dishes and flavors as well. When it came time to pay for the bill, I asked if they offered military discount and they gave me 50% off my bill! I was shocked and ecstatic! I had an amazing food experience and I will make it a priority to always visit Cafe Ba-Ba Reeba every time I'm in Chicago. I highly recommend this restaurant to any locals or tourists visiting the city. It was great drinks, amazing food, and excellent service. The parking wasn't even that bad for being in the city. I will say you will need a reservation unless you want to be waiting a long time, but I think that's a testament to how great the restaurant is. I can't wait until the next time I come to Cafe Ba-Ba Reeba! I will definitely be bringing friends and family so they can experience it as well!
