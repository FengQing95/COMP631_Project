Smoque BBQ////The first time I went to this place I saw a line out the door and halfway down the block. It was a Friday evening.  I said to my self noway, I'll come back another time.  It can"t be that serious, can it?  I finally made the treck from Hyde Park to give them another try and hopefully it wouldn't be that crowded. It was a hot steamy Sunday afternoon. No long line. I walked up to the counter and ordered a half-slab of Baby Back, a taste of brisket ($3 extra), a side of coleslaw and a side of bbq baked beans.
