Little Goat Diner////Went here for dinner with a friend (1/5) and we were told that there was an hour wait just to sit at the counter. That threw me off a bit but only for a few seconds. (I think the parking situation was more troubling to me than the wait for a seat...valet rules Randolph street). There is so much to see on Randolph that I had no problem with Â doing a little bar hopping first. We headed out to explore (have a few drinks) the nearby places for an hour and when the LG was ready for us I received a text on my phone telling me as much. Simple and effective way to be able to walk all over the place while waiting and still not lose our spot. We took a counter seat at the heart of all the action. I would highly recommend this.
