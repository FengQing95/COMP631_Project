Little Goat Diner////The breakfast/brunch menu is so interesting.  From the Fat Elvis peanut butter, banana and bacon waffles with maple syrup to the Smoked Corned Beef Hash with Eggs, there is something for every palate in this joint.  I landed on the Bi Bim Bop Breakfast Bowl which is, essentially, a low carb eater's trip to heaven.  Cauliflower "rice" topped with the world's best pickled onions, beautifully prepared portobello mushrooms, bean sprouts, pickles, red cabbage, bacon, amazing herbs and spices and topped off with two perfectly cooked sunny side up eggs. This dish was served by a very attentive fellow who really cared.  Who could ask for more?  Well, I did.  The perfectly sized mimosa most certainly contained fresh squeezed orange juice and the coffee was served at the perfect temperature, so that I could enjoy it right away.
