Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////We made it by 7:00AM Saturday, when the doors open at 6:30AM , there were ALREADY people in there, but we were seated right away. Our waiter was SUPER helpful, telling us the more famous dishes and what people to seem to enjoy more than others. I ordered the Cinnamon Bun pancakes (to DIE for) and my friend ordered the berry pancakes --she loved them as well. I had a caramel latte to drink, and it was probably the best cup of coffee I have ever had in my life. When we left around 8:30 the place didn't have an empty seat , and lines out the door. I heard a party ask for a table of 4 and they said ~2 hours. If you are going to go GET UP EARLY AND GO. Only negative I experienced.
