Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Second time in Chicago, second time at Lou Malnati's. Prepare to wait if you get gere at peak lunch and dinner hours!  Ordered minestrone soup to start (as wait for deep dish pizza is 40 mins! So had to kill time somehow!) and Buffalou's Wings to hold me over. The wings were fried, breaded, and smothered in Buffalo sauce--satisfying and solid.  My wife had the house salad w italian vinaigrette--classic iceberg lettuce, red onion, tomato and cucumber--all very fresh and crispy.  As for the deep dish pizza--definitley worth the wait!  A steaming heap of cheese piled upon veggies nestled on a buttercrust dough.  And the crust--"how dare you not eat it goodness"!  The beer and wine selection leave much to be desired.  Basically, a littany of your classic brews (Miller, Corona, Blue Moon) and generic California wines.
