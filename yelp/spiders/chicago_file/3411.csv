The Purple Pig////READ THIS! -  We decided to share a few items (usually we don't splurge but hey when in Chi-Town). We ordered  The Calamari Salad thing that came with Fregola, Radishes, Cucumbers & Pistachios as an appetizer. It had a really FRESH flavor that I enjoyed. We also got the Smashed Potatoes from the Fried Items section of the menu (though I don't see that option on the online menu at this moment). For our main entrees we ordered The Octopus with Green Beans, Fingerling Potatoes & Salsa Verde. It was good, but I felt like the beans and potatoes were just too oily and salty. The other entree we got was AMAZING!!!! The Lamb Ribs!!!!! It's not on the menu that's on their website right now, but we went only 5 days ago so it has to still be there (maybe I'm only seeing the dinner menu or something?). It was so soft and tender and perfectly juicy and sauced and yum and delish and not enough. If I every go back I will just order 2 of these and be a happy person! THE BESTTTTTTTTTTT...mouth watering right now!
