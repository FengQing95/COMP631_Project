Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My wife and I visited on a Friday night around 8pm. The place was seriously busy, and we were told the wait would be about 45 minutes. Not a problem for us as we didn't have any other plans, but be prepared to wait and plan plenty of time to eat before other plans!! They suggest ordering your pizza while you wait since their signature deep dish pizzas take about 30 minutes in the oven. They half bake it, and then put it back in to bake to 100% once you're seated. Honestly genius. We were sat 10 minutes early which was nice. Atmosphere was a bit lacking. Kinda cheesy, kinda outdated (my only reason for 4 stars instead of 5). Server was attentive and friendly, food came correct and in good time. THE PIZZA WAS OUTSTANDING. Crust buttery/flaky, lots of cheese, sauce tasted fresh and tangy... we loved it. Would definitely get Lou's pizza again... maybe just get takeout and eat back at home though ;)
