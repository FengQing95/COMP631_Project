Smoque BBQ////I was riding bikes around the northwest side the other day and a man at a bike store recommended Smoque, although I had heard about it before.  The line was out of the door on a Sunday afternoon around 2:30 and stayed that way until we left.  Don't be discouraged though, the line moves pretty quickly.  The mean was awesome-  smoked all day you could tell.  Mac N Cheese side was great and so was the cornbread.  The sweet tea was a lot better than what they try to serve at Wishbone.  Why not 5 stars? They only use the Western North Carolin BBQ sauce for the pulled pork.  I think they should have choices, although I did like the sauce.  I prefer more vinegar based but it was great BBQ and I will go back!
