Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Overrated.  I'm not the biggest fan of pancake to start off (exception: Bongo Room's red velvet)but wanted to to see if Wildberry can convert me.  First off, the wait was only 30 minutes on a Sunday at brunch hour so it wasn't too bad.  The servers are extremely efficient in doing what they do to clear the tables so kudos to them.  Now, as far as the food goes, it's definitely better than IHOP, but that really doesn't cut it for me.
