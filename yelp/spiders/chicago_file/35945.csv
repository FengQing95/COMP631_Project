Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband ordered the Bone Marrow (to start....) and I had a wedge salad. The wedge salad was incredible, but definitely for two people versus one. The bone marrow seemed super rich. I suggested my husband do an $8 bone marrow add on to his entree instead of an entire bone marrow appetizer to himself for $16 but he went with his preference over mine on that one. Looking back, I think he probably would have said that the $8 add on would have been a better way to go since we could both barely make it up the stairs when we got home.
