Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This one hurts me to write.  I was so excited to hit Bavette's due to some many favorable reviews and a deep affinity I have for all of Brendan's creations.  I was even taken there by friends who had raved about the experience.  The room was beautiful, the menu inviting, and the food was overall pretty darned good.  So you might ask -- what give Forks?  Why only 2 stars?  Here's the scoop.  The Chicago scene at times suffers from the "too cool for school" staff thing.  I come from 15 years of restaurant service and nearly 20 years as a professional person dining out.  It takes a great deal to wow me and my tolerance level for poor service is 'zero.'  I am compassionate that every server has an 'off' night.  However, bad and inattentive service is inexcusable and that is what we received.  Our waiter fawned over a table of young ladies and a table drinking big wines -- while we sat in Siberia.  His delays went without apology and I got the distinct feeling that he felt we should have been so happy to be there that any sleight should be expected.  Inattentive service flowed throughout the meal.  When the runner came with the food -- he had no idea what position to deliver the entree.  The table maintenance was an atrocity as steaks arrived without knives while empty glasses and app plates laid all over the table.  We received better service from the busboy.  My steak was overcooked (but tasty).  I don't blame the kitchen as I suspect the waiter fired the ticket late and then asked the kitchen to step on the gas.
