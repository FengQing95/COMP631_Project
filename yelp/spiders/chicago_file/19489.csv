Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time here on vacation with my husband, recommended by our hotel concierge and it's the best Chicago pizza ever! I'm back in California and have been dreaming about it since! My husband and I had the bruschetta appetizer and made our own pizza. We about licked our plates, long wait but so worth it, all the flavors in every bite! I wish they were in California
