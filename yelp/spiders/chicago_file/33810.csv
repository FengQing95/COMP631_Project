Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Big picture here, the service is really troubled. There is no real management happening of food and beverage service. Orders getting placed and food getting run with absolutely no orchestration of the dining experience. Servers are nice and happy to clean up the mess they make, but management is seriously lacking.
