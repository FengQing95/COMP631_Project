Smoque BBQ////This place is perfect... Long lines? Not a prob for Smoque! You get your food quick. The food is delicious! I always get the brisket, mac and cheese, corn bread, peach cobbler, fries, and bread pudding! Yes, I eat all of it... The slaw is to die for, along with everything else. This place is a must when visiting Chicago!
