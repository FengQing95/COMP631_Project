Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is the place to eat Chicago pie (deep-dished pizza). We came here at 1930 and had to wait 40mins for the table and another 30mins for our pizza. But guess what!!? It was worth the wait. The pizza was so yummy and it was soooo big. We ordered a medium and hardly finished it. And for $26 (before tip), it's worth the money...
