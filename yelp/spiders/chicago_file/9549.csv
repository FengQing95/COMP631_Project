Art Institute of Chicago////I was leaning towards another subject for review #500, but after a weekend visit here, I realized that there was no better choice.  Simply put, the Art Institute is Chicago's greatest tangible treasure.  I've loved it since I was a dumb college freshman who knew nothing about art, and I've visited probably about two dozen times since then.  In the last few years, I've visited many art museums all over the U.S. and Europe, and ours competes favorably with all of them.  In fact, I would put it in the top three museums in my experience (the others are the Met in New York and the Kunsthistorisches in Vienna).
