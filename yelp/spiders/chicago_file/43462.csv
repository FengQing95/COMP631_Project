Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////mmm some problems I had... i eat a lot, and when im not 120% full i don't think im happy... so when visiting by myself, i ordered the platter, the salmon, the steak, and maybe some other things... it tends to drive up the cost :/ initially when i didn't know what to order, i tend to become critical over the food considering the portion and the price. The blue cheese steak was mostly just fried chips... the steak that comes with market vegetable came with vegetable that resembled overcooked onion... im still curious what it was... salmon was dry and made me miss at the salmon at Chili's... but eventually you figure things out! you order the ones you like, like stuffed mushrooms, scallops, and sangria! and you appreciate sitting in their patio in a summer night, either by yourself or with a loved one.
