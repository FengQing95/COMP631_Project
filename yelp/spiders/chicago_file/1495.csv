Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////If you love pancakes this is the place for you!  One of the best breakfast places I have ever been to!   The signature berry bliss was a hit for me!  Mike our server was amazing.  Yelp helped us find this great place in Chicago as me and six of my best friends celebrated our 60th birthdays in the Windy City.  Chicago is one beautiful city with a ton of restaurants with Yelp's help us find a 5 star restaurant in our opinion!
