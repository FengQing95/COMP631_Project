Art Institute of Chicago////Plenty of great reviews here that spell out what the AIC has to offer.  To avoid the larger crowds go during the weekdays with the exception of Thursday pm when IL residents are free.  We went this morning (Saturday) and got there when the doors opened at 10:30am.  If you can arrive early be sure to start on the 2nd floor and knock out the areas of the museum closest to Michigan Ave, where the majority enter and want to look first.  Leave the backside of the museum for the end of your visit and you'll avoid the larger crowds.  Coat check is only a $1...which is cool because I think breathing Chicago air costs more.  There are two separate places to eat inside the museum with a decent menu, but prices are 'art prices'..so be prepared to fork over $12.50 for a slice of pizza.  Last, be sure to turn off the flash on your camera or you'll get yelled at..and don't be the pretentious prick that talks on their cell phone while admiring a Van Gogh.  Enjoy the art..it's the best in the city and one of the best collections in the world.
