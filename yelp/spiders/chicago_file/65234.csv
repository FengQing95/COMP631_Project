Smoque BBQ////I can confirm that the meat is done right. They provide sauce on the side and serve the meat dry. It allows me to add sauce to my own taste and judge the meat by its own merit. Which, was very good. Right consistency, which is to say fragile and about to break down from its time in the smoker. Perhaps a tad dry but I understand they have to do it ahead for the volume expected of a restaurant. The sauces also were not overly sugary brown concoctions either. Had some variety and some kick if you wanted as well.
