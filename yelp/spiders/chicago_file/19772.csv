Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We came in on Sunday around 4pm and there was about a 30-40 minute wait. The good thing is that they take your order while your in line because the pizza itself takes 30-40 minutes to bake so by the time your seated you won't have to wait as long. Also you can get a drink or apps at the bar while you wait.
