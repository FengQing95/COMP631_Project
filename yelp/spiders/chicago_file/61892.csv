Smoque BBQ////Beef blessed by a priest? It quite possibly is here. Tender and juicy. Just what a slab of meat should be. The sides I've tried are excellent. The place can get quite crowded. Its ok though cause the brisket aroma will drown out their funk. Parking sucks around there. Only negative i can think of is introducing my father in law to this. Now every time i see him i get, " wheres my smouqe biiiiiiiitch?"
