Smoque BBQ////I won't go into too much detail about the food. There are hundreds of articles and reviews and blogs about this place. Smoque has a reputation similar to the late Hot Doug's. The employees take pride in the food and are happy to serve you. Prices aren't even that bad. Anywhere in the suburbs will charge you similarly.
