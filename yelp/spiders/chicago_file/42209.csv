Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have only been to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba a hand full of times, but it is definitely one of the best tapas restaurants I have been to.  The staff is well informed about the menu and friendly also.  Everytime I go I try something new and get one of my favorites.  I recommend the spicy meatballs, and spicy potatos.  I have also had the stuffed mushrooms, chicken empanatas, (both delightful) and even tried goat.  It was tender and delicious!  It's easy to get a table without a reservation if you go during the week, otherwise plan accordingly.
