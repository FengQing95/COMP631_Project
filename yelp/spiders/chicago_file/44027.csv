Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We left out of this place stuffed. We even left food on the table. Everything we ate was amazing. I would recommend getting the Â Pintxos Platter. Why just choose one when they give you the option to try them all! My favorite was Rioja-Braised Short Ribs, Mashed Potatoes and Mango Sangria YUM! Make a reservation a head of time if you want a table for the weekend as this place is always packed! If not the wait will be about 60-90 min!
