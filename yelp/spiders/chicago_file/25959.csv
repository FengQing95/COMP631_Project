Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Service was fast and friendly and the decor is great (especially the old skateboards), but the pizza fell flat for us: there was little to no salt in the dough, which made it painfully noticeable. It made me feel like I was eating a communion wafer, and I haven't been in church for years. It took me right back to Sister Miriam smacking me with a ruler at Saint Mary's High School.
