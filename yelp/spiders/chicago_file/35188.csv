Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I honestly can't say enough good things about Bavette's. My boyfriend and I came here for our one-year anniversary. He made a reservation several months in advance for the basement dining area - definitely worth it. It's dark down there, but the ambience is unbeatable. And the food - I've honestly never had a better steak. I chose the bernaise sauce, and I still have dreams about it. Get the mac and cheese too - totally worth the calories. If you're in Chicago and you're looking for a unique, special occasion place with great steak, Bavette's is where you should go.
