Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We went early on Saturday and got a table at the bar. This place is packed and it is so overwhelming. Another classy touch is the 'announcements' that come throughout the night. The loudspeaker will call out one of the many people waiting around for a table. It's like going to The Rainforest Cafe 'Tarantula, party of 4'. It is LOUD in there. Why are people waiting for this place for so long?!
