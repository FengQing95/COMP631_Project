Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Yea I'm #1800 review and I'm telling you it rocked. Out of bounds rocked. Get the classic, pick your size, chow down. It pains me to say that as a born and raised Chicagoan who moved I was always a thin crust guy. Too much dough, Malnati's is close enough for me to almost jump sides. Almost. This is as good as it gets for deep dish, not too much and cooked perfectly throughout. We got a Giordano's on the northside, c'mon Lou you have 25 locations in Chicagoland, can't you move one down to Indy? Excellent pie, well deserved reviews.
