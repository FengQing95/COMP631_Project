Little Goat Diner////The service was good, but they appeared to be a bit understaffed given how busy it was even at 2:30.  Our waiter was friendly but looked a bit frazzled.  At first, he even gave us the wrong check but immediately apologized.  There menu is huge and I can't wait to go back to try more things out!
