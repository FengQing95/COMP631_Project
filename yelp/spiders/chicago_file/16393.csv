Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After trying deep dish pizza from numerous restaurants in Chicago and even in SoCal, the best is still Lou Malnati's Pizzeria. I had been to this location back in 2012 and loved the bustling atmosphere. We started with the Calamari Fritti. The batter was a little heavy (would be great on fried chicken), but crispy. The calamari was cooked perfectly and not rubbery. The marinara sauce added a sweet, tanginess to balance with the salty, spicy batter. We ordered a Pepperoni Deep Dish Pizza with olives and butter crust. The crust was crispy and buttery. The pizza was full of gooey mozzarella cheese. The sauce was mild, but brought all of the ingredients together. The pepperoni and olive combination is onolicious! Their pepperoni is more like salami versus the pepperoni that you would traditionally get on a regular pizza. The taste hasn't change since my first Lou Malnati's Deep Dish Pizza in 2007. You can taste every ingredient. It's truly amazing! We ended our meal with the Tiramisu. It had great espresso flavor. The mascarpone was creamy and light. I loved the touch of chocolate sauce and chocolate chips!
