Smoque BBQ////After you get past the cheesy name and logo and the long line you end up with an aluminum tray piled with food. I enjoyed most every morsel.  I had the brisket plate. The meat was cooked mmmm perfectly; however, I would have liked it to be sliced and then cooked some more in the sauce so it could caramelize. Otherwise, the dipping sause is too tomato-juicy in my hypercritical opinion. But, I am crazy. The slaw was superb if you like the non-dairy type (I like both but you probably don't care). I would pass on the standard fresh-cut fries if I went again; although, I did like the cute paper bag they came in.  It's expensive, but the price holds up in my court.
