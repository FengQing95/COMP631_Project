Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We went here for a birthday dinner during the week and I was at first skeptical about trying a tapas restaurant. I'm not one for sharing entrees at restaurants but figured I'd give it a try. I'm sure glad I tried this place out. The food was absolutely delicious and the service was unmatched
