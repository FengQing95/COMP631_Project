Little Goat Diner////In the end, everything was a nice thought, but was consistently forgettable and never quite made it into the fully realized stages of an original and complex adult dish. To top the experience off, at the end of the meal, we asked for a split check, which our waitress promptly forgot about. Perhaps Seattle has spoiled me with its devilishly thought-out details, but sad to say, in a city that's supposed to be a foodie town, I wasn't all that excited about the food at Little Goat.
