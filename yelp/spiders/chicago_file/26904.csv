Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my first time trying deep-dish in Chicago, although I've had a few run-ins with deep dish in San Francisco (Little Star, Patxi's). From word of mouth, I heard the best way to order is to-go, then pick it up because pizzas usually take 45 minutes to come out. Good suggestion because it's the perfect walking distance from Navy pier, Millennium Park, and other sightseeing touristy spots. When I arrived at the original Lou Manalti's, there was a crowd of people and probably a 30-40 minute wait on a Wednesday night, which attests to its popularity.
