Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////While waiting for the table we all went to the bar.  They have a Bloody Mary bar where the bartender/waiter hands you a glass of vodka and you do the rest.  Each Bloody Mary is 10.00 each which at 1st seems steep but with amount of toppings at the bar, you can eat a meal with the bloody mary.  Unlimited bacon, shrimp, veggies, olives, etc and a variety of mixes from mild to spicy.  If Bloody Mary's aren't your thing, they also have 4-5 different sangrias including a sangria of the day.
