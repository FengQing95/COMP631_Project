Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn't go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers. Â It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn't spend $600 at this place.
