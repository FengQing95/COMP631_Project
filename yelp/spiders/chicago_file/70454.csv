Little Goat Diner////I was pretty disappointed by their bakery section. Got the gluten-free strawberry muffin and lemon (I think?) rosemary scone, the two most highly recommended items by the lady working the cash register, and they were just NOT okay. Couldn't even finish half of it. But the place looked cute and I heard that actual restaurant was really good. Gotta still give them a star for super friendly service. The guys let us sit on the table outside even though we weren't dining in.
