Little Goat Diner////Found service to be on the slow side.... it was packed, but still. A little more speed from the bar service and our waiter would have been appreciated. I wanted the bulls eye french toast, but they were out of it ("Busy weekend!") so I settled for the shrimp and grits, which were really, really tasty. A whole different approach to the classic dish - with brussels sprouts, tomatoes, pistachios, etc. My wife got the chocolate crunch pancakes which were on the dry side. And we split some mac n cheese - which was dang good.
