Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I stopped in to grab a quick bloody and was blown away by the sports bar vibe this tapas spot had! The bartender, Ryan, and was beyond awesome and instantly makes you feel like a regular. The menu was amazing. The people at the bar next to us came from Michigan just to eat here again. I'm definitely coming back hungry and thirsty for a bears game SOON!!
