The Purple Pig////Small place, been here a few times. The bone marrow is very good. We also had the octopus very good. There is lots of unique dishes that all need to be tried one plate at a time. I ordered a gin and tonic with cucumber. I did not expect what I received. It was probably the best gin and tonic I have ever had. I will deffitnly Â come back just for that drink alone. My only pet peeve is that the place is limited with seats and I know people are paying good money for there wines. But if you have 2 sips left you should be conscious of the people waiting. Also if your partner goes to the bathroom after dinner you don't need to wait for them at your seat. They have a small waiting area by the hallway. In not so many words think of others and don't hog the seats
