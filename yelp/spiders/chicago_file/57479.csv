Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is so fun! We came here on vacation for breakfast tapas and it didn't not disappoint. It's tucked in a corner, so keep your eyes peeled! The paella is a must (creamy, runny yolk my egg on top) and the Cubano was delicious. It's such a fun restaurant with build your own Bloody Mary bar! I would recommend this place for tourists, but I know a lot of locals also indulge in this!
