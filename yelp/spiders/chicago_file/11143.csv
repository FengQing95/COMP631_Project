Art Institute of Chicago////I want to apologize in advance for all the pictures that are going to follow this review. But I LOVED this museum! Definitely tied with The Field Museum as my favorite museum in all of Chicago. I think we spent about 6 hours here and we even rushed through some of the exhibits!
