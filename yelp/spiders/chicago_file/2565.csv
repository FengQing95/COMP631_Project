The Purple Pig////My parents recommended this place to me as did a friend who lived here. We came around lunch time on a Friday. Place was packed but only waited 30 minutes. We ordered a few dishes to share between 3 of us. We started off with the cornbread with goat cheese and honey. That was amazing. We also ordered the fried pig ears with kale, pork shoulder, sardines and and a cheese and meat board. Everything was very good. Wasn't a fan of the sardines plate. Just too fishy. Overall enjoyed my experience at the purple pig and would definitely recommend to others.
