Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////A coworker and I went here on our first visit to Chicago last month after hearing several recommendations. We tried both the deep dish and thin crust pizza. The deep dish was terrible and tasted mostly of canned tomato sauce. The thin crust was better but still nothing I would ever go out of my way for. We ended up giving the second half of our deep dish to a homeless guy outside.
