Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////An amazing gastronomic experience! went to central standard - which i really like - and found it closed down.  we went to bavette's which is one block down by gilt bar.  it is charming old world french decor and has a warmth and intimacy. we didn't have to wait and did not have reservations.
