Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We went to another location, but I can't remember the location. Anyways.... ordered the cheese bread and the fried veggie plate as apps. Both very good. The spinach bread probably would have been good,  but it wasn't hot in the middle. I ordered the classic original , I think.  I forget what they called it. But it was the sausage pizza  with extra cheese. Their specialty.  It was soooooo good. Lots of crushed tomatoes. Full of sausage and cheese. Could only eat one slice. Server was very nice. Would highly recommend.
