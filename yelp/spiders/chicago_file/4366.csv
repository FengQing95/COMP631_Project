The Purple Pig////What stood out even more than the food (which was incredible) was the fact that the service was phenomenal. When we arrived we were greeted by two separate waitstaff offering water and to explain the menu. Throughout the meal they checked in clearing plates, refilling water and confirming our satisfaction of the dishes but we're never invasive.
