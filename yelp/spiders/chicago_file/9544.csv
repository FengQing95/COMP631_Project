Art Institute of Chicago////My one beef with this museum is how it's set up.  There are areas you have to walk back down to the first floor to get up to on the second floor.  And some of the modern art they have on display made me think they were trying to send a message to the students of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.  That message was, "look, we're a huge museum and we bought this crap so you can be a crappy artist and some museum will buy your work as well.  Now hand over the tuition check."
