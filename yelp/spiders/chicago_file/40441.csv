Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place was delicious. I should have taken more pics. We had the shrimp cocktail, the fried chicken , and a few sides. Everything was delicious. Oh and the chocolate pie was amazing!! The best part was our server. She was amazing. Just very sweet, felt like an old friend. Really made us feel welcomed and taken care of.
