Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered a small 'The Malnati Chicago Classil' and their house salad.  I loved the salad.  I'm not a big fan of sweet dressings, which many like restaurants have, but this one was surprisingly to my liking!   The pizza was sauce, cheese and sausage, but the sausage was basically one big patty that covered the whole pizza.   Sounds strange, but it was very good!  The small ended up being two slices  each.  I wasn't able to finish both of mine and we barely finished the sald.  We both left pleasantly full and not weighed down and gross.  The crust was delicious, but I wished the pizza had was more sauce!
