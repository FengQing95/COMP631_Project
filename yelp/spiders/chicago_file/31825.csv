Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm no expert in deep dish pizza but whooooo-wheeeee was Lou's muy delicioso. On a road trip from VA to CA, my family and I stopped by Chicago to pick up a deep dish pizza. Given that we we're swinging through for a quick min (mainly because everything was pretty much closed), I had to make an audible for a location. Fortunately 6K reviews, 4+ stars average shows that Yelp kinda knows something about this spot. At least that's what recent studies show. We swung by on Memorial Day, so the streets were fortunately empty enough, and without anyone checking parking we just stopped curbside for our food. The windows were tinted so it was tough to see inside, but they had a note on the door informing customers to call if no one came outside. Luckily we didn't have to call, and someone came out lickity-split.
