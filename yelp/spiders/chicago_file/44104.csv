Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Now, for the tapas themselves; I was not impressed.  The spicy potatoes were flavorless and served with a bright orange flavorless sauce.  The ahi tuna was overspiced with spices that would be more appropriate on beef, served on a salad drowned in oil and vinegar.  The goat cheese was fine, but I've had better at the Medici on 57th.  The endive salad and the calamari were yummy, but I wouldn't return just for these two dishes when the rest of the menu isn't on their level.
