Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Wow. After finally dining here for the first time, I can't wait to come back. Everything at Bavette's was incredible - the food, the service, and the overall experience. Even the complimentary sourdough bread was delicious. I was only able to take photos of the wedge salad and espresso martinis we ordered because we could not wait to eat anything else. We ordered the wedge salad, goat cheese, burger, filet, truffle Mac n cheese, and drinks, which was probably too much for two people. My favorite was the truffle Mac n cheese but I would order everything else again. Although we did not order dessert, they brought out chocolate ice cream for us to celebrate our anniversary (I noted a special occasion on the reservation). There is a Covid surcharge and about a $2.50 charge per person to reserve a table through Resy.
