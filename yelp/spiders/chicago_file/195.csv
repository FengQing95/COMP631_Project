Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I have ordered from this restaurant in the past and thought their food was great. However, today I ordered through their online app and received a text from the uber driver (that the app supplies) that the order would not be ready for twenty minutes and the driver could not wait that long I needed to call the restaurant. So I did and reached the manager Nick. He supplied the worst customer service possible. When I told him what happened he was like well what do you want me to do about it. I said you tell me I ordered through your app with your driver. He did not offer to make any other accommodations to get the food to me and hung up on me after telling me he was going to cancel the order. He never confirmed he was refunding my card so I then had to call back again and he was as ignorant as possible again. After his poor treatment and lack of customer service I will never go back to this restaurant again which is unfortunate because usually I enjoy their food. I will be calling back later this week to reach another manager and report Nick who was so absolutely ignorant and unhelpful. Worst customer service I've had in a long time.
