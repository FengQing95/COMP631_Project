Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Though I enjoyed the service, they handled our group with aplomb, I really don't see myself coming here again because I get really frustrated when I leave a restaurant with a sore throat because the place is acoustically so loud. Plus the food was just okay, there's nothing that looking back I necessarily crave.
