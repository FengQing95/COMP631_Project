Little Goat Diner////We had ordered diet cokes. We are admittedly fast consumers of diet coke but not demanding or impatient at all. I am not a regular diet coke drinker in the first place (although my partner is). But after nachos and meaty dinners, our thirst does need to be quenched. On our request for a 3rd refill of diet coke (occurring about an hour after being seated), Wally the waiter said quite sternly, "You guys need to slow down, OK?"
