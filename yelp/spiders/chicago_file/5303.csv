The Purple Pig////I came back here after 6 years and it's still just as good, if not better, than I remember it. In the past 6 years, if I ever met anybody from Chicago I'd beg them to try the Purple Pig if they hadn't already. I'm so thankful to be back. Do yourself a favor, seriously, eat here! I'm only hoping they finally open one up in Los Angeles.
