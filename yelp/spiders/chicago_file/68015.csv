Little Goat Diner////Went  there for lunch today with my daughter. Very disappointing.  We ordered the crab dip appetizer which was very good but it was served with Ritz crackers which were too soft to stand up to the heaviness of the crab spread. I ordered the reuben sandwich - my mistake. Too much going on with the flavors; the pickled cabbage was awful and had large chunks in it. The bread was overly high fiber and had no moisture and had been grilled too long such that it was almost burned. Waitress was sweet but long wait for our food and again for our bill, which was $50 for lunch for two with no alcohol. Rediculous!
