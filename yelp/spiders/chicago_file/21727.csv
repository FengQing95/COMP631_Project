Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It's our favorite Chicago style pizza. We like the deep dish and thin crust. The appetizer pizza chips are delicious too. We have enjoyed take out and eat in. We have eaten on second floor and it is a comfortable setting. We had the best waiter. He was cheery and explained how large the portions would be.
