Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////After finally being seated, the service was good, the food was really simple and easy but so delicious! The goat cheese baked in tomato sauce was amazing, as was the spinach/artichoke dip, the asparagus and manchego cheese, sicy potatoes, beef tenderloin and blue cheese. The chicken and ham croquetas were really tasty but really heavy, I was done after having one croqueta.
