Smoque BBQ////Awesome, small BBQ joint. The food is absolutely delicious. On a purely food front: some of the best BBQ I've had outside of Tejas. I guess it's the ambience that doesn't do it for me (as opposed to a Green Street, for example). Ambience goes a long way when it comes to BBQ. And the fact that I can't have a cold beer with my brisket. A man has his needs.
