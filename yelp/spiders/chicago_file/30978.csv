Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my first time to Chicago. I loved it and I want to go back!. We got to this place around 6:30 - just in time before it got crowded. The waitress busted her but to make our dining experience prefect. I got the Chicago Classic. My co-workers got the sausage crust pizza, which they loved. The wait for the pizza takes a bit, but worth it. The wine was good, just understand that you are paying city prices. Work was paying so I wasn't sweating it : ) - this place rocks!
