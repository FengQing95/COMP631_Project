Smoque BBQ////Darling fianc√© and I went on a whim one day while we were in the neighborhood for lunch. Surprisingly, there was not a wait at all! I like the whole chalkboard menu concept.. Makes for the fast time BBQ experience! Anyways, I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and my babe ordered the brisket. We shared a Mac and cheese as well. The service was good and the food was up fast! The Mac and cheese is unforgettable! It was so so yummy! I'm happy I don't live in the neighborhood or I'd be a lot heavier as a result of frequent visits for that reason alone. The pork and brisket were tender and the bbq sauce was on point.
