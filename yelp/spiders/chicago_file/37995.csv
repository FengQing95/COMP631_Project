Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I always thought of Bavette's as a special occasion place that I'd keep on my bucket list and never cross off. On a whim a couple months ago (mid-January), I decided to try and get a reservation for my birthday (end of March). Surprisingly all that was available for dinner hours was 9:15pm. So CLEARLY this place is pretty sought-after.
