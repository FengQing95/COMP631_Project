Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////One of my favorite restaurants ever. The food is exquisite. Every single item on the menu I have tried has been to die for. You can't pass on a steak when you come here, it's crazy good. The ambience is very cool. The service has always been amazing. What more could you ask for. This place is just one of a kind.
