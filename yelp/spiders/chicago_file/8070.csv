Art Institute of Chicago////One note...if you are trying to see many of the museums and the Sears (it's still Sears to me!) Tower while on vacation, BUY THE CITY PASS!! It's about $90 per person, so if you get to 3 museums, it more than pays for itself.  We spent 4 days, and saw all 5 things on the City Pass...the BEST part of it is that you get to skip the regular lines and walk right in!  Plus you get access to some of the exhibits that cost more money.  DEFINITELY worth the price!
