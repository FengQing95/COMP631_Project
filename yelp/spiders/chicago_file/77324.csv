Little Goat Diner////Wow! This place is amazing! I came here with my friend for breakfast and wanted to order everything off the menu which I kind of did! I loved everything that I ordered. The dark chocolate pancakes melted in my mouth! The avocado toast is a MUST TRY! I personally don't eat salads but oh boy this toast with salad on top had a sweet tinge to it which was perfect! Their hash browns had melted cheese inside and eggs were perfect! Hot chocolate was great too! I haven't tried the steak tacos yet but I brought them home for dinner. Honestly this place has food that TASTES good and has a great ambiance! People are super friendly and I had a great overall experience. Will definitely come back!
