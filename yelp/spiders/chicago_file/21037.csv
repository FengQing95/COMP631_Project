Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm not a huge fan of deep dish, because well it's basically a casserole - but if I'm in the mood for pizza casserole I'm going to have Lous. The classic cheese is my go-to, you've got the perfect combo of buttery crust and gooey cheese to feed your soul during the winter. Oh, and do yourself a favor and order the Calamari Fritti! SO GOOD.
