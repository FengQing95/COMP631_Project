Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////With all the good Spanish places in the city, I don't understand how this one is still in business. Seriously, I'm probably too used to good restaurants, but this one is disgusting. And I don't think it's a matter of taste, we all have different taste, it's a matter of quality! More or less all Spanish restaurants offer the same things and i have been to quite a few to be able to compare and tell the difference. I went there for the second time, first time I didn't like it, but I was willing to give it another chance. Done, they won't see me and my friends anymore.
