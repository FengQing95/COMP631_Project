Little Goat Diner////Finally pulled myself away from Girl & the Goat to try the Little Goat Diner.  Very glad I did.  Had the Fish tostadas, the fish was lightly battered.  I do wish there had been more avocado.  Got an order of the Brussels sprouts in a fish sauce vinaigrette, with crispy onions, this had great flavor, but a little salty.  Would definitely return.
