Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I really like this place, and I love tapas for group dinners because the food becomes an activity and it's great. You can honestly order anything off this menu and it will be good. I wish I remember the items that stood out, but I remember not disliking anything we've ever had there. Great place, especially for groups!
