Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I have established a strong aversion against River North restaurants --  too many places filled with girls with short skirts and sky high heels and too few places actually care about the actual food. So before we got to bavette's, I was expecting a typical River North spot--modern decor, loud hip music, meat market. But the moment I walked in, I fell in love with this place! I love love love the decor of this place, very old school with bricks and dark wooden walls. Combined with the jazz music they were playing, it's as if I was brought back to the 60s like the Mad Men show. The crowd was very diversified too, I saw couples of our age, I saw older people hanging out, I saw friends getting together - all in all, a very unpretentious crowd by River North standard.
