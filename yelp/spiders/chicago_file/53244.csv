Smoque BBQ////Do not get the ribs! These were a dry rub and the meat itself was dry and very smokey (I guess that it why they call it "Smoque"). The worse part was that my fingers smelled like smoke for the rest of the day, after washing my hands a couple of times. It was so overwhelming that it literally made me sick to smell that all day. The only thing to remove the smell was a scented lotion. In fact, it's making me sick right now... just thinking about it. I cannot speak for the rest of the food.
