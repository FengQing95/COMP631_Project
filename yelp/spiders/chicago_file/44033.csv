Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We decided to try out this tapas restaurant based on the good reviews and went to this restaurant on a friday night. The restaurant is really nice, friendly staff and good food. The only reason we didn't give it 5 stars is because the tapas came out one little plate at a time with long waiting periods in between the other plates. So we would finish one tapas and then fill up on bread waiting for the next. We have been to many other tapas restaurants before and we would usually get at least two to three dishes brought out at once and then the remaining shortly after.
