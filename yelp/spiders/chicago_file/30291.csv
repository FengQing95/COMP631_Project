Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The service was quick, friendly, attentive, and honest. I say honest because they tell you that the pizza will take about 45 mins to cook (if you're ordering deep dish...and I don't know how you couldn't!) So, take that 45 minutes to drink a couple beers and build up the anticipation of great pizza to come.
