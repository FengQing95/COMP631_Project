Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Overall, a pretty good tapas place.  Tasty, but none of the tapas amazed me. If you check-in here through yelp, you get a free paella of your choice (1 person serving).  We ordered the paella de mariscos for the table + same one for the free version.  Surprisingly, the free one tasted better (the rice had more flavor & had a slight char to it..yum). vs. the larger paella was soggier.
