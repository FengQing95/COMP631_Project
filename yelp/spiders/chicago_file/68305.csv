Little Goat Diner////This is UNACCEPTABLE and if I had read the reviews, I would not have stepped foot in this restaurant!! There is a serious HEALTH ISSUE and I am going to call the Health Department and file a complaint. I am also demanding that the $124 that we paid for the meal be reimbursed to all of us.
