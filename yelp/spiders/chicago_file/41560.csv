Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////At the end of the day, the tapas place with which we benchmark every other tapas restaurant in Chicago against is our favorite (and first): cafe iberico.  Honestly, this place does a great job of putting up a fight.  It really only loses in terms of price, but honestly, given the location and decor, it's probably worth it.
