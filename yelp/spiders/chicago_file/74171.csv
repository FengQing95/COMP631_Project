Little Goat Diner////After being told it would be a 2 hour wait at another establishment, we decided to walk down the street and stumbled upon this gem. There was a 45 min wait but we found ourselves two spots at the bar and avoided the dreaded wait list. We ordered the Okonomiyaki and the Macho Nachos and we were not disappointed. The Okonomiyaki ( forgot how to spell it) was an amazing discovery and I am so glad we decided to skip a burger and order this little piece of heaven. It was sweet, it was salty, it was the bomb. The Macho Nachos were simply amaze balls and I couldn't stop until the plate was empty. The mixture of beans, guacamole, pickled onions, pork, and house made chips will definitely have me returning for more and singing it's praises to all that will listen. Do yourselves a favor and get to the Little Goat!
