Smoque BBQ////This is my favorite BBQ spot in Chicago. I like to bring friends here from out of town for an "authentic" Chicago restaurant experience. The waiting in line part just adds to the anticipation. I have been here many times. I usually like to get the ribs or the pulled pork sandwich, the mac & cheese (creamy), the baked beans (best I've ever had in life), the cornbread (sweet and fresh), Â and the fries (freaking amazing- nice and crispy).
