Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We had the red sangria, that was delicious! And we ordered the steak and blue cheese, the grilled octopus and the potato omelet. The steak and octopus were outstanding, the omelet was a bit dry... wouldn't order it again.. For dessert (also in small tapas size) we had the almond caramel bar and the chocolate truffle cake, both very good.
