Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////AMAZING experience all around. We started off with the mixed greens apple salad which came with warm bread and homemade butter-- delicious! My boyfriend scraped the candied pecans from his salad. Then we were on to the entrees. I ordered the steak frites and my boyfriend ordered the roast chicken, both were delicious. For a side, we ordered the elote style corn, as suggested by our waiter which was an excellent companion to our already scrumptious meal. We went on a Wednesday night and the ambiance was perfect-- packed, but not too loud, upscale, but not pretentious. Our waiter was very helpful and attentive. All around a solid five stars.
