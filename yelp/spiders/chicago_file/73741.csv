Little Goat Diner////They get crowded but we got a seat at the counter and didn't have to wait.  The servers were friendly and helpful.  The menu was quite big and I had a lot of questions.  Luckily our server was patient with me and pointed me in the right directions.  I seriously would come back to try everything on the menu.
