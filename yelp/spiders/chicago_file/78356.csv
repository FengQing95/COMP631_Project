Little Goat Diner////I also ordered the smoked corn beef hash with 2 sunny side up eggs. The runny yolk poured over the crispy hash browns and thinly sliced beef. Unlike a lot of other corned beef hashs I've had, this was didnt use cubed potatoes inundated with peppers and mushrooms. They certainly didn't skimp on the beef.
