Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My boyfriend and I ended up ordering online and picking up which was the smartest thing we could have done. The line was about an hour and 15 minutes wait on a Sunday at 7PM. I had never seen so many people willing to wait so long for pizza. We were able to walk right in and pick up our pie, no wait.
