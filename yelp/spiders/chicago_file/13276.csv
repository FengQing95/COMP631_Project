Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If Chicago style pizza is your thing, then Lou Malnati's is the way to go. The buttercrust is flaky and the filling is bountiful with enough cheese to make you run on a treadmill for 3 weeks straight! I don't care for deep dish honestly; I used to but I can't eat them anymore. But I absolutely love their thin crust and I felt that there's a better balance between the filling and the crust and it highlights the crust a little more. The service at this location is also friendly and I would definitely come back.
