Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had the Lou's and a half cheese-half pepperoni and they did not disappoint- loved the buttery crust. The pleasant surprise of the meal? The house salad! My friend ordered the family side for all of us to share, and the home made dressing was amazing! I'm not a big salad eater but I could have filled up on that! Definitely coming back!
