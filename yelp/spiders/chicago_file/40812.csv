Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////i'm giving this 5 Stars because my Indulgence is the CURRY CHICKEN OMG!! My friends and i Work our tails off for 2 hrs at the gym .. then get to this joint.. and eat our favorite tapa's to the point of someone needing to roll us out of there !! Love it!! .. .. ohh and Don't forget the Dessert.. it's Delicious... and has definitely inspired me to become a better cook at home
