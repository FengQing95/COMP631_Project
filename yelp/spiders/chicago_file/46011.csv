Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I would highly recommend ordering the red sangria, spicy potatoes with tomato alioli, and goat cheese baked in tomato sauce. You also have to try the beef tenderloin & blue cheese and rioja short ribs and manchego mashed potatoes. All of the meat was so tender; it was really juicy and fell off the bone.
