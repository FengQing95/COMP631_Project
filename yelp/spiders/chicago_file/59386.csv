Smoque BBQ////It looks like a BBQ joint outside and in.  We approached the ordring area and looked over the menu.  There were at least 10 people in the "kitchen" - more than I've ever had on a hot line (I'm a chef) in my career.  I ordered a 1/2 rack of baby back ribs, side of sliced beef brisket, BBQ beans, mac & cheese and cornbread.  My GF ordered the pulled pork, cole slaw and mac & cheese.
