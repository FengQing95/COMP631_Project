Smoque BBQ////I love Smoque's BBQ. I seldom eat pork, except on occasion, like B-Day, (which is why I went) holiday days or vacation. I live in the south suburbs of Chicago but will travel for Smoque's , yes it's that good. What's good, Bbq, corn bread , & mac-n- cheese, oh & the coleslaw. I had the fries once some years ago, but it was a lot so I don't order them. I ordered a whole slab, the other half is in my freezer. I love the cornbread & mac in their own tinfoil container, I also ordered some to take home as well. I went for lunch on a weekday & it was not crowded, surprisingly, so I enjoyed eating inside. Last year I ordered to go because of COVID.
