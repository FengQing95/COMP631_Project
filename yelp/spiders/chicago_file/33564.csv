Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Ate at Bavette's Tonight for my boyfriends birthday and it was amazing! I had to make reservations 3 months in advance but it was well worth the wait. To start we had avocado stuffed crab, for main dishes we had salmon and chicago cut steak, and for dessert we had the best chocolate cream pie that I've ever had. OMG. So good. The only complaint I have is that it was freezing in the restaurant and the music was too loud.
