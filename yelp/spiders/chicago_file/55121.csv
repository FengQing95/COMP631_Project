Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our server went out of his way to accomodate best friend's food allergies.  He even got the kitchen to make a beautifully prepared flank steak without the allergen-riddled sauce and best friend loved it.  He was back and forth several time to the kitchen to answer questions and clarify ingredients.
