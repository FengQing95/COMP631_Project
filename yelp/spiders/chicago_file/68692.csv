Little Goat Diner////At Little Goat, don't bypass Little Goat Bread, the bar, and the merchandise area. Steph sells her sauces and rubs in the merch areas, plus special toppings and takeaways in the fridge at Bread. The bagels shouldn't be missed and the shrimp sandwich is unbelievable. The cocktails and beer menu are excellent.
