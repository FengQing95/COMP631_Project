Smoque BBQ////Came in around 5 PM on a Sunday (scored the parking lot in the back that's only available at weird hours for Smoque customers) and the line was only a few people long and open seats.  30 min later (Bears game at night), the place was packed, consistent line out the door and no open seats.
