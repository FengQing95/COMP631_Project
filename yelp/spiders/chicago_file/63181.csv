Smoque BBQ////For someone who has spent a lifetime in pursuit of the perfect barbecue (read reviews of 60+ other barbecue joints across the country), I'd have to say while Smoque isn't it...  it is awfully close.  Once you've found a parking place and made it inside, stay away from the diluted sweet tea, order extra sauce from the get go, and get set to savor some very good cue.
