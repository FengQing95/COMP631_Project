Smoque BBQ////I had high expectations for Smoque after seeing it featured on a number of shows and the great reputation through word of mouth. I certainly do not want to deter you from trying this place out but I was not impressed with the sliced brisket or pulled pork. The meat was on the drier side and sauces were not well balanced, too much smoke and spice and not enough sweet. But BBQ is a lot of personal preference. The sides were smaller than expected as well. The Mac and cheese was tasty but again, small portions. My favorite dish was the BBQ Gumbo, which I think is safe to say consists of the older meat. But it had good flavors especially when mixed with cole slaw and cornbread. The Coca-Cola was also on point. Overall, it's hard to head that way again especially considering how close I am to Green Street Smoked Meats. But again, I'd encourage you to try this place out yourself.
