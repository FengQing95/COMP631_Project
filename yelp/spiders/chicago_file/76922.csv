Little Goat Diner////We liked the classic diner decor (it may even be a diner from years ago and just redone?), and the place was super busy, which was a good sign. Â They don't seat you unless your whole party is there, and we had a 10:30am reservation, and although all of us were there by 10:40, we had to wait another 10 minutes for a table.
