Art Institute of Chicago////The Van Gogh exhibit was something I could not pass up when in Chicago. It's an extra $5 for the special exhibit on top of the $25 for entrance to the museum (if you are local there may be a cheaper price). While the Van Gogh exhibit is beautiful (supposedly one of the larger ones to make it to the states) I was hoping there would be a few more pieces. Â
