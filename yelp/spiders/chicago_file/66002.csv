Smoque BBQ////This is hands down the best rib place in Chicago land . We only order from here . We love everything ! The ribs , brisket , chicken , turkey . Sausage etc. the side are also so good ! The corn bread is to die for . The Mac and cheese is my sons favorite. The bbq sauce is so good they have regular and spicy . Â We like spicy and this one has a kick . We live about 45 minutes away so when we go we order enough for 2 days . Just writing this review is making me drool . Yumm!
