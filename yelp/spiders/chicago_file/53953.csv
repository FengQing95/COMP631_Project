Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////So we booked this for restaurant week since it's on the list and has been on our list of places to try for a while. We had a reservation for 8 and were there before but didn't get a table till 8:30 so I'm not sure how/if the reservations work. But that was the only bad part. We skipped the restaurant week menu and went rogue. The fried peppers were delicious and try spicy potatoes tapas were not too far behind. We went for empanadas and paella (yay rice!). The chicken empanada was flaky and melted in my mouth. The chicken paella had the rice just the right amount of paella sticky and was flavorful. I had the peach white wine sangria and and and they sent us two complimentary desserts -- I gobbled both of them down (chocolate and whipped cream and whatnot). Our server was friendly and helpful and I know I'm definitely returning. I just hope the wait to get a table is shorter.
