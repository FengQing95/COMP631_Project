Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I had an omelette - it was nice and fluffy, filled with cheese and very good.  Probably one of the best ones I've ever had.  On the side i had biscuits and gravy.  Oh man.  So good.  I couldn't get enough of it.  The gravy had a wonderful flavor and the biscuits were nice and buttered and wonderful.  Even though the place was packed, our food came out nice and hot.
