The Purple Pig////Came here to see what's the hype all about and left a bit disappointed. Went in and sat at the long communal table since it was just me. I ordered the Stuffed Squid. The presentation of the plate was beautiful! But it was too salty for me. The black sauce was acidic so it definitely helped out with the saltiness of the stuffings inside the squid. It was an okay experience for me and the dish didn't really blow me away with its flavors. Maybe I'll try something else on the menu next time to see if I like it better.
