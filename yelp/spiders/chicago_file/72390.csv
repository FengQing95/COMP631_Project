Little Goat Diner////So I am the only Chicagoan who has never been to The Girl and The Goat. I am so embarrassed, being a Yelp Elite and all, eeek! Don't worry, I finally have a reservation. So anyway, I thought I would never make it to this place, but my coworker one day was like, let's go for lunch! And we did!
