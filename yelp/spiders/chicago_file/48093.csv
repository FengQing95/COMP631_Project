Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ok, hit this place when I lived in Chicago several times but have been living on west coast the last 15 years. Came back to visit and craved some tapas and came here. Oh my, it was as good as I remember. Iberico pork, lamb, shrimp, bacon wrapped dates, paella and a tray of 4 desserts. Phenomenal! Â Love it and friends who tried it for first time agreed. Good times and loved being back in Lincoln Park.
