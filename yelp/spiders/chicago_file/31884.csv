Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is my first time to Chicago. I was looking for a great place to try deep dish pizza. Lou Malnati's Pizzeria was recommended. It lived up to the recommendation. We called to see if we needed reservations, and at the time we wanted to go, they said we didn't. We sat down and ordered appetizers and the deep dish pizza. When the appetizers arrived, they blew us away. The pizza was as good as advertised. Our waitress, Natalie was very friendly and made our visit very enjoyable. If I come back to Chicago, I will come back. I highly recommend trying Lou Malnati's Pizzeria!
