Little Goat Diner////I love Little Goat! With such a creative menu filled with unique brunch choices, you would never think that their best item on the menu would be their bagels.  From the restaurant side, the bagels are hardly advertised and neither are their amazing smears. I might bring an out of town friend to come and try the traditional sit down menu for brunch or lunch, but really, the best part of this restaurant is their bakery.  From fresh baked breads, to naan, to their smoked salmon smear, I can't find a more delectable bagel anywhere in Chicago.  Come and try everything, but if you're on a budget, just come to the bakery attached to the restaurant and get an awesome coffee and bagel + smear. You WILL NOT regret it!!!!
