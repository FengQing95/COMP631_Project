Smoque BBQ////In other words, Smoque is very good for the city but a mixed bag overall. If you want some SERIOUS 'cue and are willing to drive for an hour and a half to get it, Charlie's Piggin' N Grinnin' in Benton Harbor, MI. Charlie McGee is a world-class multi-state BBQ champion and knows how to do a pig right. Plus, his four sauces (regular/sweet, hot, tangy and may-based) are all phenomenal.
