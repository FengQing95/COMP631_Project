Art Institute of Chicago////Further along, there are other side galleries with 19th/20th century American works (American Gothic, Nighthawks, etc.).  We also did a timed exhibit about Van Gogh's bedroom (and 3 successive paintings he did of it).  We wrapped up the tour with the modern and abstract wing.
