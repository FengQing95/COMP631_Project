Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Anyway, service was great! The pizza crust was so good. We had the Malnati Chicago Classic and the Lou. They were both good but I think I like the classic better. The price isn't so bad either. Considering its location, $64 for some very good pizza and appetizers feeding 3 people is not a bad deal. The only bad thing I could say is that I can't find you in New York! I can't wait to go back.
