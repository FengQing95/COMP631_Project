Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food on the other hand let me down. My steak had more fat and grizzle than I had seen before. At least 25% of the steak was inedible. I suggest going one level higher (medium instead of medium rare) because, like my wife's steak, could have been brought back to life by a well trained veterinarian. Sent the steak back to get it done properly and it came back over cooked.
