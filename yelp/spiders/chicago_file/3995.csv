The Purple Pig////- Menu options: The different and creative dishes on the menu are so interesting. I think the name of "The Purple Pig" really fits with what the chefs are doing here with twists and whimsical surprises in terms of what you could serve up with a pig. I have never seen pig's feet on a menu until dining here.
