Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The place itself is very cozy & warm. They have a cute little separate waiting room where my boyfriend and I sat and looked at the menu because there was about a 15 minute wait. They told us that it takes about 30 minutes to make the pizza so they suggested we order while we wait but we didn't end up doing that.
