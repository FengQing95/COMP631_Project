Little Goat Diner////Out with friends for Sunday brunch we decided to try this place. We went at 1130 and there was already a 2hour wait, so make reservations or be prepared to wait. Once we were all seated, we ordered, and got our food fast. We had a great waitress who was very patient with our large party. I ordered a burger with cheese fries that were amazing!!! Another member of our party got fried mashed potatoes...it wasn't so good.
