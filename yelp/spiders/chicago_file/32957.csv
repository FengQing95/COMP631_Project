Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Amazing service, atmosphere and food!  We had the dry aged bone in ribeye (best steak we've ever had), corn (crazy good), bacon (unbelievably delicious and I'm not a big bacon fan), crab stuffed avocado salad and frittes (homemade fries).  We left raving about everything and super stuffed!  Will definitely go back and take our friends.
