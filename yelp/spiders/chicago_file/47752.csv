Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our server was very good at first, but then we saw her less and less. She only came over if she was bringing us food. We had a lot of plates that needed to be cleared away and the table was getting very crowded. My other complaint is that we were seated at a table in the back near the bathrooms but in the corner next to some sort of door and my chair kept pushing up against the stair/ledge near it and it was very annoying.
