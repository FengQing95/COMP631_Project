Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Liked this better than Iberico. Food was tastier. Tried an assortment of tapas, including the baked goat cheese in tomato sauce, empanadas, salmon, and potatoes, and also a paella. Everything was delicious. Potatoes were pretty standard though. Pretty good service. It is somewhat pricey though, but many tapas places are.
