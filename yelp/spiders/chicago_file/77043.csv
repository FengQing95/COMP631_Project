Little Goat Diner////My boyfriends mom told us to stop by here while we were out with my cousins, heard from both parties that this place was good. 45 minute wait but that didn't really steer us away especially me since I was gawking at everything in the building. Loving that retro theme and all the employees has their own sense of style and I was LIVING for it!
