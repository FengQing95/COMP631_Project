Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The sangria is also a reason you should visit! There are several different flavors you can try, but I stick with the classic red sangria. The bacon wrapped dates are a must try too. I really enjoy the goat cheese marinara plate as well. The garlic bread that comes with it is oh so yummy!
