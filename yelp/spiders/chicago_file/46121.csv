Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My opinion of this place might be a bit skewed because the night we came here, my fiance was stuck in traffic on his way home from work so I found myself stuck in the Ba-ba-reeba bar tossing back sangria with some random chicks celebrating a birthday.  So by the time he walked in the door, I was already a smidge tipsy.
