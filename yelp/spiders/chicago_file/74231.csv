Little Goat Diner////The four of us were able to be seated at the communal table right away. Our table had nearly every seat full, but there was plenty of space for the 3 or 4 parties occupying the space. Our waitress was super friendly and helpful with our orders, and we got our food fairly quickly, although not all meals were brought out at the same time.
