Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I would like to say that I had high expectations for this place when I first heard of it. Unfortunately the evening turned out OK - if that. Our waiter took FOREVER to recognize us, and never really checked on us throughout the meal. We ordered cava sangria which was pretty good but came with WAY too much ice. We barely got 4 glasses out of it.
