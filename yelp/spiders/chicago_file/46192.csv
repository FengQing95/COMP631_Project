Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I was so stuffed the last time I went, that I was going to skip dessert, however our friendly, on-the-ball server talked us into get one to share. Not only did he bring us a phenomenal banana, caramel mini dessert, he also brought us one he said was his "personal favorite". He also comped both desserts - Where do you find this kind of service??? I'll tell you where...Cafe Ba Ba Reeba!!!
