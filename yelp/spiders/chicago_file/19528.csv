Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When it comes to ordering, me and my compatriots do one thing: We order the Lou Malnati's classic, and then add pepperonis on top. So you're getting sausages, a ton of cheese, and a bed of pepperonis. It takes about 30 minutes to get your casserole, so be patient, grab a beer, and enjoy your company.
