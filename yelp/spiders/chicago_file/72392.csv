Little Goat Diner////I had a Green River to drink, haha, those remind me of being a kid. We ordered the fried pickles and onion rings as a side since everything comes a la carte. They were great. Came with homemade ranch too, can't go wrong there! The menu is gimungous. We asked our server for recommendations. I went with one, the Chicken Cordon Blue sammy. It was GIANT when it arrived. Holy cow. It was super delicious though and super messy. The fried chicken on it was super crispy, I like that. I couldn't finish the whole thing.
