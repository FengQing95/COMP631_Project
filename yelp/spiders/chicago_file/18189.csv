Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time in Chicago and I couldn't leave without authentic Chicago deep dish. This did not disappoint one bit! Be prepared to wait a bit to get in and then another bit after you order your pizza because this deliciousness takes time. Waiter was great. Good bar with everything you could need including some good local choices on tap.
