Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Haven't been here in years and am in town for work and decided to head back. I love tapas and this place is perfect for it! Usually order 3 plates for each person at your table for sharing. We ordered the passion fruit sangria- very good and they use real fruit. For plates- goat cheese with tomato, Brussel sprout salad, beef empanada, bacon wrapped dates, spicy potatoes, and garlic shrimp. Everything was so good especially the dates and the empanada. Also by checking in you get a free desert- caramelized bananas were so good!! Would go back again- cool atmosphere and great service!
