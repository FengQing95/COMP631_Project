Art Institute of Chicago////There is definitely a lot to see at the museum. Although the layout is disjointed and at times can be confusing to find what you really want see. I could have easily got over that if the staff and some of the other museum goers would have been more respectful. I do highly recommend the cafe next to the Architecture and Design exhibit. Great Cuban coffee!
