Little Goat Diner////This place was very cute and the food was pretty good. We went on a Sunday morning and had reservations. It was packed. I ordered cinnamon rolls but we were informed they were burnt so we got crumpets instead. They are gooey lol I wasn't expecting that and I won't order them again. I also got a paratha burrito. I thought it would have some Indian flavors but it didn't. I wish the food was more flavorful. The hashbrowns were super cool! Very crunchy. Nothing was bad, but nothing was amazing either.
