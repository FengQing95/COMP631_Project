Smoque BBQ////Stopped in @ 8:30 on a Friday night...line out the door, but got to the counter in 15 minutes...take out took 5 minutes...very impressive...pulled pork was top notch, best I've had...packed with flavor and very juicy...great bark and texture...no need for sauce but I did love the Carolina vinegar based sauce...brisket was good, not at the level that you get in Texas but still very good...tender and smoky, strong beefy flavor...baby back ribs were ok...a little scrawny and on the dry side...but this is coming from a guy who has perfected the Kingsford Invitational winning recipe from Robby Royal of Rescue Smokers...so I'm accustomed to world class baby backs...they take precision and complete attention...so i understand there is a huge difference when smoking for hundreds of people but they are still going cheap on the meat itself...just my opinion...
