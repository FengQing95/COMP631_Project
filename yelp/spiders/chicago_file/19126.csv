Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place is great! Definitely a tourist trap (but not in a bad way). When you come to Chicago you HAVE to try this place at least once. The pizza is really good, traditional deep dish! If you eat it with a knife and fork, you won't get any weird looks. Make this a destination!
