Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////From start to finish,every single bite was nothing but deliciousness. I must warn, it seems like a lot of dishes are cooked in oil, so if you value your heart, buyer beware. It's truly not crazy greasy at all, but if you're super cautious about what you eat, this would be my only concern.
