Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is so much fun and the staff is really helpful on suggestions and super nice. The vibe is cool and the food is to die for. HOWEVER, it is super expensive and my one friend and I spent about a hundred dollars or so easily in one sitting. So only go if you're ready to lay down your wallet. I go rarely because of the prices but honestly from the way the food tastes I am not surprised by how much it costs. The food is honestly so good that I once had a dream about it.... seriously.
