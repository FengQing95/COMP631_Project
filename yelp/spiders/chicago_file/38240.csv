Bavette's Bar & Boeuf//// The meal ended with dessert at their downstairs bar, I ordered a single scoop of vanilla ice cream and a side of hot fudge- you can see the aftermath in my photos. The dessert was a great way to end the meal although I have heard that they have an amazing chocolate cream pie so if you've got room, I recommend going that route.
