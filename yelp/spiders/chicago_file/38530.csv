Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Not cheap and not easy to get a reservation, but so very worth the extra effort. They have a lot of bar seating if you do not have a reservation, but decide to go last minute. My friend and I sat at the very comfortable lounge seating downstairs while we waited (over an hour) for a table. The atmosphere is super sexy and the drinks are great, so the wait wasn't that big of an issue.
