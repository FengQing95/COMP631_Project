Smoque BBQ////Everything here is good.  My husband has had every type of meat on the menu except the Texas Sausage (that is being saved for the next trip).  His favorite is the chopped brisket.  Mine is the pulled pork.  Last time we went (for Valentine's Day) he got the best of both worlds 1/2 pulled pork and 1/2 chopped brisket sandwich.
