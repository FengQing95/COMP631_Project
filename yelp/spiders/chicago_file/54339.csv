Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tapas(small plates) restaurant in Lincoln Park neighborhood. Don't t pass this spot up or you'll regret. We tried 15 plus different tapas and the only dud was the lamb tenderloin (over cooked). Highlights were the meatballs (great with the house bread to sop up sauce). Cheese plate is really good. The roasted dates with bacon and apple vinaigrette, spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms were both winners. A surprise hit was the spicy potatoes with tomato aioli. Seared scallops and calamari were both cooked perfectly.
