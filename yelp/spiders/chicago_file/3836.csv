The Purple Pig////It's a tapas place that also has a wide variety of wines, cheeses and meats to choose from. We had a few different dishes. The choripan panini was chorizo with carmelized onions. We also got the beets. I've never eaten beets before, but when I saw that it came with whipped goat cheese, pistachios and nut butter, I had to try it. I have no plans to eat more beets in the future, but it was a pretty good, inventive dish.
