Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Only problem was the service. The busers, hosts, and other staff were super friendly and helpful, except for our waiter Tony. Tony started the evening by neglecting to greet us for about 15-20 minutes, and when he finally reaches us, told us he was struggling with 4 tables and very busy. I understand Friday nights can be hectic, but this behavior continued. We gave him out order immediately, since we had read the menu thoroughly, but it took him about 20 more minutes to bring us water! He apologized for that as well, but seems pretty simple.
