Smoque BBQ////All in all, I'm lowering my Smoque rating to 2/5. It really is "Meh" and I really have experienced better. It's not A-OK, and I'm pretty certain that I'll never have a craving for it. In fact, if I'm with a group of people and they all suggest Smoque, I won't adamantly refuse, but I will definitely be the first to offer a new suggestion.
