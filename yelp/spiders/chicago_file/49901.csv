Smoque BBQ////The coleslaw is pitch perfect, tangy rather than sweet, and very simple.  It cuts the flavor of the meat just right.  Every so often I'd swing over to the coleslaw for a moment, and going back to the meat was like taking a first bite all over again, and that's something you'll probably appreciate as much as I did.  The mac and cheese is great, crusted with bread crumbs and dense cheese sauce, the cornbread is excellent, and the fries are simple quality, but if you pass up the ridiculously wonderful cobbler for them you'll regret it.  Get the cobbler.  The baked beans are unusual, with an almost apple flavor and chunks of onion, but definitely good.  They're probably not for everyone, but I liked them a lot.
