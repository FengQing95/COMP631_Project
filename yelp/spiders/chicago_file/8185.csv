Art Institute of Chicago////I'm never sure what to expect at an art museum, and especially when tickets are expensive I get wary. However, the Art Institute of Chicago truly has something for everyone. The miniatures were incredible, the architecture and furniture displays fascinating, the modern art was equally confounding and cool, and there's a ton of European Renaissance art for people who just want to see paintings of saints. You could easily spend a day here.
