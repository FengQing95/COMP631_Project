Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////And now the interesting part. There is so much salt in this food! Why?! I went up two pants sizes even though I diarrhea'd that goat cheese from the early '90s throughout the night! That's not right. Neither is being woken up in the middle of the night with the runs after what would have otherwise been a benign meal (toast with some goat cheese and tomato, and a pork chop).
