Smoque BBQ////The has a wide variety of items, but we ended up ordering a full slab of ribs consisting of 1/2 baby backs and 1/2 St. Louis style as well as brisket and pulled pork. For sides, we got mac 'n cheese, brisket chili, fries and cole slaw. The ribs were my favorite by far, namely the baby backs. The meat was incredibly tender and just slid off the bone -- could've eaten a whole slab by myself. With those ribs and a thick slathering of their tangy BBQ sauce, I was in heaven. The brisket and pulled pork were amazing too, both being flavorful and smoky, but didn't quite shine like the ribs. Out of the sides, the brisket chili was disappointing. The flavors were muddled and needed more seasoning. The fries were crispy and hot -- there's something about eating them out of a grease-soaked brown paper bag that makes that much more appetizing. Mac 'n cheese was creamy and cheesy with a slight brown crust on top just how I like it.
