Smoque BBQ////Best BBQ in Chicago... you can order brisket chopped and charred and it will be a lasting memory.  The pulled pork is succulent and juicy and the best I've had.  Sandwiches are served on a soft brioche bun.  They sell-out fast since the meats are cooked over 24-hours or something... call ahead.  Coleslaw and creamy-cheddar mac and cheese are stand-out sides.
