Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My only complaint is that the tables are so close that it gets loud really easily and it's a little bit difficult to get up and go to the restroom or leave. But that doesn't change my opinion about it as a whole and doesn't change the fact that I will go back there again and again...and again. PS, make a reservation.
