Smoque BBQ////I had Smoque cater my birthday party last Sunday. About 20 people. We had brisket, pulled pork, chicken, ribs, Mac and cheese, and cornbread. They arrived on time, did the setup expeditiously, and were gone without so much as a ripple of disturbance. The food was excellent. Our guests who had eaten at Smoque before were delighted to see them show up with the food. Those who were new to Smoque raved about it.  But best of all, the owners of the apartments above us asked us tonight if there had been a fire Sunday because they smelled smoke. And that, folks, is all the testimonial you could ever need.  I'm only going to be 75 once, and I'm really happy I had Smoque cater the event.
