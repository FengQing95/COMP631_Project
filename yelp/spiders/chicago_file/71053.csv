Little Goat Diner////This was our first time here and it was great. The server didn't help much with our ordering but once we finally figured out our order and got our food it was delicious. I had the crumpets and a side order of cheesy grits. My wife had the French toast which had fried chicken and strawberries on top with an egg cooked in the center of each slice. I would certainly go back. I want to try their cinabun or cinnamon roll that they have but they run out of those and the croissants around noon.
