Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////First trip to Chicago and I heard a lot of talk about this restaurant.  Let's discuss an incredible Steak House that lives up to it's reputation.  The ambiance is incredible, from the wood floors, to  the dim chandelier lighting.  Want a real treat, go downstairs and have a cocktail at the bar and enjoy the laid back vibe.  The steak is amongst the top I've ever had. I highly recommend the bone in Dry-aged Ribeye with Bone Marrow. Melts in your mouth, it's 22 ounces and feel free to share so you can enjoy what more of the menu has to offer. Crab cake was tons of crab meat just a light dusting of panko on the outside to hold it all together.  Had the wedge salad with THICK cut bacon and it was absolutely delectable, I don't know how they did it but the dressing was in between the layers of lettuce so you got some with each bite.  Sean our waiter was amazing, so accommodating and made the entire experience a pleasure.  MUST try place in Chicago
