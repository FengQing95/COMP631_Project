Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The best deep dish I've ever had. I wish I had some right now. It was very crowded when I went, but was totally worth the wait. The staff was very friendly and worked hard for everyone to get seated and get their food quickly. The Three Cheese Bread is a wonderful appetizer, but you must be careful. It is easy to get really full before the pizza even comes. I suggest going here when you're starving because it allows you to eat as much as possible. I highly suggest this place. I want it now.
