Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Probably the best steak I've ever had. It's worth visiting Bavette's just for the steak alone, but that said, the ambiance, service, music, decor, and other menu items make it an incredible restaurant for a date night, an evening out with friends, and it's casual enough to do what I did and had an early dinner with my family.
