Little Goat Diner////We love this place. We love that they switched from Portland's Stumptown (a once small business that sold out) to Chicago's Dark Matter, which is SUPERB. The ultimate test for this Yelp reviewer is always whether or not the business has a decent gluten free menu. This place makes its own gf breads and pastries! The very best thing on the gf menu by FAR is the Reuben. Do yourself a favor and get it. Things that sounded like a great idea but we're less amazing: the choco taco (sour cream ice cream with stuff in the dish that made it taste like breakfast cereal--odd) and the apple tomato soup. Just not that good. The clam chowder was amazing. Ask and it may very well be gluten free the day you go depending on what chef has prepared it. (I was told that they sometimes use tapioca.) We have yet to make it across the street because we always forget to make reservations but I can't wait to try their more upscale Girl and the Goat.
