Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Everytime I have family/friends visiting me from out of town, my first stop is always deep dish pizza. This time, we arrived around 8:30pm and it was packed as usual. We ordered the classic large Lou and a family sized spinach salad. The salad was refreshing with fresh strawberries and the perfect amount of feta cheese. The portion size was more than enough for our party of four. The service and food was great. The only thing that ruined our experience was how long it took for our pizza to come out. We were served close to 10pm and by that time, we had already been finished with our salad for a while and slightly hangry. Otherwise, everything was great and I'd just recommend coming in with the expectation that your deep dish will take a while to make.
