Little Goat Diner////We also ordered their bread dish.  Can't remember the name but it was a special miso bread with kimchi on the side.  The bread was tasty but that kimchi was chef Izzard's creation.  Wasn't too impressed by it since it was just a pickled relish really with a bit of spice.  I'm Korean so if you're gonna serve kimchi, there better be something different about it.  It was just okay.
