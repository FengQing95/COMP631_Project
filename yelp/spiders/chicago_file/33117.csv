Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Had a wonderful meal at Bavette's the other night. Loved Bavette's punch first off.  Eating highlights included the ribeye (definitely order the ribeye as it's so good), salmon tartare and the butter that came with the bread.  We weren't huge fans of the wedge salad as it had too much dill.  Overall, wonderful meal. Loved the ambiance. Service was attentive.
