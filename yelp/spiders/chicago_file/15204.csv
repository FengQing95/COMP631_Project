Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered to go, but still got great service from the hostess. Since we called our wing order later we had to wait a bit for it to finish cooking. We (me and my cousins) were starving after a long day at a graduation so we got our pizza first and started munching on it in the waiting area. The hostess offered us a 6 pack of drinks because our food was taking a little while. Was truly satisfying sucking it down with a nice cold beverage.
