Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou's is well known across Chicago for the deep dish pizza. Having tried Lou's and giordanos, I'd have to say I'm more of a Lou's fan. The crust is the selling point, very buttery, it has an excellent flavor and crisp. I actually prefer the thin crust, so whatever crust you pick, Lou's is a great choice!
