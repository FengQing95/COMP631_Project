Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The personal size is the perfect amount. My husband ordered a medium on our first visit thinking it would perfectly appease his appetite. Lo and behold his appetite was quenched with just one deep dish slice! Since we were in a hotel, we donated the remaining pizza to a very excited man in our way home. Everyone ate well that night.
