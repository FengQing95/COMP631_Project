Little Goat Diner////I went to the Little Goat for breakfast.  The service was good and the food came out quickly - friendly waitress and my water glass was always filled when empty.  Ate this little piggy went to China - the amount of sauce was to much for me.  Sausage was a little pink, and my eggs were dark brown on the bottom.
