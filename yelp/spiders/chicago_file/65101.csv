Smoque BBQ////The barbecue was wonderful. It is so difficult to get that dark crusty surface with a moist and tasty inside. On the downside, I think they could make it work a little better if they took reservations or even when you are there they could give you a number or a beeper to indicate that your food is ready. Also we had Memphis BBQ sauce and I kind of prefer the Kansas City variety. On the plus side, they let you Bring your own alcohol in --you have to open it yourself per city rules. If I were rating on the food alone, it would definitely be five star but I think they could make the set up for ordering and delivery better.
