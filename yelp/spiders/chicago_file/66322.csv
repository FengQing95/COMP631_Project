Little Goat Diner////So update - the bakery side has been bumming me out lately. The other week I went in at 11:15 to get some chili and it wasn't ready yet, though their site says they start serving it at 11:00am. Then today I went in at 7:45 to get a gluten-free muffin and they said it would be five minutes. I know 7:45 is early, but not for the weekday working crowd. So I decided to go with oatmeal instead, which appeared to be fine, but then the guy came back from the kitchen and said it would be an HOUR before that was ready. So I decided to wait the five minutes for the muffin, which turned out to be 15 minutes. They did give me a pretty hefty gluten free dinner roll on the house, plus everyone is always nice there and the food is great. But just heads up...don't go expecting them to have what they say they do.
