Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I wanted to love this place, I really did.  I heard so many great things about it!  The spicy potatoes were great!  Sangria was pretty good, rest was eh.  I guess I am comparing it to Cafe Iberico which isn't fair since I love that place so much.  The food was just average, nothing bad to say but nothing super good to say either....
