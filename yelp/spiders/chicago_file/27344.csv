Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our bill came and we only got charged for the appetizers - calamari and spinach stuffed bread. It came out to be $5 per person only so we decided to tip extra. Gave about 22% tip because of the great service. My friends weren't too crazy about the pizza though. I thought they were okay but we came to the conclusion that Chicagoans haven't tried pizza until they try NYC pizza.
