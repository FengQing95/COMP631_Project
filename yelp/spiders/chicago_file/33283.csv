Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////One of the poorest service experiences I have had in 20 plus years of living in Chicago. We waited 50 minutes for our table to ready (we had a reservation) and 20 minutes in we had to reach out to the host to check status. The manager was nice but not helpful and as we had made the reservation 3 months before we decided to stick it out. I wish we hadn't. Food was good, I will give them that. But once seated, the manager never reappeared to check on us , and oue waiter was obviously not apprised of our frustrations and how upset we were, not to mention starving at that point. food service was slow the entire meal. I am not one that expects something for free, but comping at least 1 item on the bill would have been a nice gesture, especially after the manager - when we were on the verge of leaving - promised it would be worth our time to stay. Â I'm disappointed and would advise you to look somewhere else. Doesn't live up to its hype.
