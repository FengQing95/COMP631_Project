Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////-Entr√©e. Food is delivered [husband first, again]. My steak was good. Perfect temp, but under-seasoned. The potato had some un-rendered bacon on it. The elote was good, the fries were fries. My husband's steak, however, had the most gristle we've ever seen in a filet. Between the bone and the steak was a huge mess, and the steak was all lobe-y and just inedible. The bone side always cooks more than the rest- we know that- but it was a hard medium on a rare steak. He's upset [it's an $80 steak, and it's a shit cut].
