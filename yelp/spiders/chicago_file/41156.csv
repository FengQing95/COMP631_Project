Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The entire experience was unconscionable and the sad thing is, this restaurant has so much potential because the food is not bad for what it is(I mean we are not talking about fine dining here) but service is service whether you are at L2O, Alinea, or Â even dive restaurants--obviously CBBR isn't a dive, but I think I have had better service at Weiner Circle or Ed Debevics, if you get my drift.
