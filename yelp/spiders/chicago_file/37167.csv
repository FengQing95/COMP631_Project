Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Service was friendly and efficient. I really liked this place. My only reason for not giving five stars is the prices. They are up there. $16 for a salad is way too steep for me but since this is not an everyday dinner for me I went for it. I definitely would like to return here and try other menu items.
