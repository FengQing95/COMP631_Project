Smoque BBQ////There is nothing better than Smoque in the city of Chicago. Great sides and great prices. If you are looking to not wait in line, order ahead, but keep in mind, you need to order a few hours ahead so that they can tell you what time your order would be ready. Best brisket outside of Texas.
