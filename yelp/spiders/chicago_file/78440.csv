Little Goat Diner////Bull's Eye French Toast with Fried Chicken & strawberries on top. Not sure about this... Beautiful soft sweet onion brioche with an soft egg within, but the combination of sweet brioche with bbq maple syrup and savory chicken just did not work for me. I thought the brioche & syrup overpowered the dish.
