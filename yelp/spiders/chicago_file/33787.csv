Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We started with the Baked Goat Cheese which tasted even better than it looked. For dinner I had the Filet and my boyfriend had the Bone In Filet. We both agreed they were some of the best we've had in Chicago. We also split sides of the mushrooms and the corn as recommended by a lot of Yelpers as well as our waiter. They were both delicious.
