Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I loved everything about this place! The dark, romantic ambiance, the food, the exquisite cocktails, the vintage touches. I had the steak frites and it was the best steak I have had in a while. Our waiter was quick on the service and very attentive without being overbearing. Will definitely return.
