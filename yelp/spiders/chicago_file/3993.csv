The Purple Pig////- Very friendly and helpful staff: We came in around 6 pm on a Sunday and it was packed. We found chairs in front of the bathroom and the hostess came around twice to make sure she got our names correct for when our table would become available. The speculated hour wait turned out to be 45 minutes instead. Our server was also attentive without being overbearing and came to check up on us multiple times.
