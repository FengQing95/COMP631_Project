Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We arrived for an early dinner on a Sunday night and by the time we left, the crowd outside was bigger than the crowd inside. It takes 45 minutes to bake so I highly recommend ordering while waiting for a table so there is less wait once you are finally seated. We did order a Malnati's salad and all the "stuff in it" made for a very tasty bowl of roughage.
