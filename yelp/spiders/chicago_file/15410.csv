Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou's did not disappoint.  After we were told we would wait 1 hour and 15 minutes, we got our seats after 45 minutes.  We got the sausage deep dish and the appetizer platter.  The deep dish was excellent (although in the past their crust has been saltier, which I prefer) and the fried cheese and veggies were perfect.
