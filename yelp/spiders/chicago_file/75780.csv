Little Goat Diner////The Little Goat is like a diner in the sense that it has a huge, bright interior with a raucous and cheerful vibe.  It is like a diner in the sense that it seems to be home to everybody -- couples with kids, couples on double dates, older folks, and a pack of almost a dozen teenagers at a giant table together.  And it is also like a diner in that it has a giant menu, with both breakfast dishes and savory dishes served all day, and a dizzying organization that makes it hard to even decide what kind of meal you are eating.  (Cinnamon bun?  Cocktail?  Sandwich?  Salad?  Coffee?  Fried pickles?  All six at once?)
