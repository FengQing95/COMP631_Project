Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is one of the better places to eat that we've been to in Chicago, and that's saying waaaay more than a lot.  Worth the high price tag.  Manhattan's were perfect.  Bone-in ribeye is top 5 I've ever had.  It should be a city law to start your meal with the smoked whitefish Caesar salad and a wedge.  Don't even question it, just order those when you sit down.  The service is slow, but I think that's on purpose.  We weren't in a hurry, so didn't really care.  Best place I've been to in a while.
