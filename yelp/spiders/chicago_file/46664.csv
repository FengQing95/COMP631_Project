Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The tapas are decent, but nothing extremely memorable.  The one dish that is the exception is their patatas bravas, probably the BEST patatas bravas I've had... and I go to A LOT of tapas places.  Their bacon wrapped dates is one of my LEAST favorites I've tried and their butterscotch dessert was EXTREMELY sweet that we couldn't take more than a lick of it.
