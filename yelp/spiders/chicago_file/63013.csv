Smoque BBQ////Holy Moly- This stuff is delicious.  Guys, I am not from Texas or anything- just a local Chicagoan- but this stuff is legit.  The beef brisket is so soft and just basically melts in your mouth.  I've now been to the location on Pulaski as well as the location at Revival downtown.  It is one of my favorite places to grab a meal.  I highly recommend it.
