Smoque BBQ////My new favorite BBQ in Chicago! What a great meal. These guys sure know how to get BBQ done right! I had the brisket platter with 2 sides. Brisket was cooked perfectly, tasted great and was temperature hot. Not common in many bbq joints as it's obviously easy to dry out. I chose sliced brisket as you have choice to try chopped. The brisket was juicy, flavorful and looked awesome with a healthy smoke ring. My guest had the St. Louis style ribs which were also great! Nice flavorful dry rub and cooked to perfection. Not fall apart nor too tough, just right! The sides were highlighted by their baked beans. Good smoky flavor with lots of bacon and brisket chunks throughout. The Mac n cheese was ok as was their vinegar based coke slaw.
