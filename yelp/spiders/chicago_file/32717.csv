Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Service took really long. If you're not into special delicacies I don't recommend this place. I also don't recommend that you make drink requests - stick to what's on the drink menu. Ordered a cucumber mojito and had to send it back. I think the waiters recommendations were just bad. However, the steaks were amazing.
