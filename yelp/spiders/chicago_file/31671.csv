Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered The Lou size small to share between 2 people. I felt this was a good amount of food to leave us feeling satisfied, but with a little room left over in case we wanted to try out some snacks in the city. Since The Lou does not have any meat on it, we also added the chicken sausage as a topping. I really enjoyed my slices and felt that the topping flavors worked really well together. I usually do not enjoy pizza crusts but I finished all my crusts.
