Little Goat Diner////Arrived at 12:40 on a Saturday afternoon and was told it was a 45 minute wait for a party of 3 so we put our names down. Got a text at 1:05 that our table was ready so we wakes back and we're seated at 1:15. The indoor dining was hot, barely cooler than outside. A waitress provided water within a couple minutes of seating. No ice so we requested some and it was provided. We ordered the Okonomiyaki, The little piggy went to China, the veggie burger, and a chocolate shop pancake at 1:20.
