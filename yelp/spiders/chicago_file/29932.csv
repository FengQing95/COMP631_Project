Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For my first visit to Chicago, I am very happy that I took the time to find and dine at Lou Malnati's.  The staff gets 5-stars for being extremely good at their jobs, you can tell they care about service.  I ordered bruschetta and their bruschetta has me ordering bruschetta everywhere I go now just in case it is as good as Lou Malnati's. The pizza was excellent like I hoped it would be. I'm a fan, I'll return and I'm glad I can say I've tasted this deliciousness.
