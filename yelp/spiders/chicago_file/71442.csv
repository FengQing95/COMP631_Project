Little Goat Diner////I have been here twice and I've gotten different things here. The first time I ordered the los drowned and the crumpets. The crumpets were delicious but the los drowned was not my cup of tea. It was a bit too messy and soggy but that's my fault. I was disappointed to learn that fries do NOT come with the sandwiches which was surprising cause the prices are pretty high for a diner. The fries were absolutely forgettable and not worth it in my opinion. The second time I went I got a pulled pork sandwich which was ok. The service was quite sloth-like and it took forever to get our food. They also completely forgot about the milkshake I ordered and the waiter was noticeably annoyed when she saw that the food runners still hadn't brought it out. I feel like I just ordered wrong and have bad luck haha but Idk, my personal experiences weren't great. but that's just me. I do really like the interior of the restaurant and the color scheme. They do have some tasty dishes.
