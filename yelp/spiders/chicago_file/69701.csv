Little Goat Diner////Sure wanted to like this place as just moved to neighborhood. 2 experiences have left me very disappointed. Once they were really rude when i went to pick up bagels, and once at the breakfast counter they took forever and messed up my order, which btw was 2 eggs and a bagel, completely anyway.
