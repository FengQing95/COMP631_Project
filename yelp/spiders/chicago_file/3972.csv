The Purple Pig////Roasted bone marrow - Barely a year ago I was a bone marrow rookie who's never tasted it before. Now it's pretty tough to pass it up when I see it on the menu. This was seriously a deep ass bone, and the marrow was everything I expected: slimy, rich, and flavorful. The salad it came with was a nice little touch.
