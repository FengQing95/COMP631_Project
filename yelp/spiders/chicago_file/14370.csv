Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Had the bruschetta for appetizer. It was good but I came here for pizza. Pizza finally arrived, after the first bite, I ordered another one! Yes it is that amazing!! I'm surprised the waiter didn't think we were crazy but yes this skinny girl can eat! It wasn't as "deep" as I thought it would be. But that probably worked in our favor. I read reviews for other places that were too cheesy but this was perfect. Dough, cheese, sausage, tomato sauce, then topping. Different than NY pizza which I never really cared for. But OMG they deliver to different states, very tempted to call them to deliver to NYC!
