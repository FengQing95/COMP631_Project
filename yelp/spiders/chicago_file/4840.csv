The Purple Pig////The roasted bone marrow ($16) came in such generous portions! Two bone marrow on a platter. I loved the pickled cilantro and fennel that went with this dish. The bone marrow was a little bland but the salad and salt helped a lot. The sheer amount for the price was worth it! The crunchy toasted brioche bread was delicious!
