Little Goat Diner////This is just another mediocre restaurant coasting on the celebrity of its owner. I live in the neighborhood and have been to Little Goat maybe a dozen times over the past few years. Tonight was my most recent visit and will likely be my last. The restaurant was FREEZING, we were rushed to order (despite the restaurant being half full) and the food was not that good. I've never had a meal at Little Goat that I thought was better than average. If you care at all about what you are eating, there are a 20 places within walking distance that are better than Little Goat. The only reason to go here is that kids love this place. When my kid starts paying for dinner, we can come back.
