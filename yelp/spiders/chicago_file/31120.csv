Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I met up with a friend for pizza on a Wednesday night. Wait time for a table was about 30 minutes and it was fairly busy when I got there. The inside has a bar area, dining tables in the back area, and a few benches to sit and wait on the first floor; the second floor is all dining area. You can order your food while you wait for your table which is expedites the Â food wait time a bit. They also give you a link to see where you are in the waitlist.
