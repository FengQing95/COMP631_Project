Little Goat Diner////Slightly more traditional but definitely not your average French toast. It was so soft and light which worked perfectly with the salty fried chicken. The warm syrup that finished it made a perfect bite. One thing that was a bit offputting was the egg white in the middle of the French toast. It added lightness but I found it a bit runny and ruined the texture around the middle.
