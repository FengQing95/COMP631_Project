Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For comparison, the only other deep dish pizza I've tried before Lou Malnati's was Zachary's in Berkeley. Â Zachary's is worth the trip across the bridge from SF, so I imagined Lou Malnati's would be just as worthy. My buddy in Chicago mentioned this place is good so what better place to eat deep dish pizza than at the Windy City itself?
