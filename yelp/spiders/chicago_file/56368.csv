Smoque BBQ////People love their ribs and I have to be honest - our first rack of their ribs was terrible.  This rack was dry and, though there was a discernible smoke ring, the smokey flavor wasn't deep.  We had a second rack of their ribs and it had a little more tenderness and flavor.  But our impression was heavily biased by that first rack of ribs.
