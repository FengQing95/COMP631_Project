The Purple Pig////Milked pork shoulder - the shoulder meat was melt in my mouth yum. Loved the smear of mashed potato at the bottom. I couldn't stop piling the meat and mashed potato combo onto the grilled toasts (Yep making my own tasty sandwich). Although It was good dish, I still found it forgettable.
