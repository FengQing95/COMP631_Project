Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The butter crust in the deep dish was out of this world. My husband and I loved it so much. The pizza is very filling we had a medium out which comes with 6 slices and he ate 2 slices and I had 1 slice and we stuffed. There is no need for appetizers with the deep dish. There is a bit of a wait. We were told we had a 1 hour and 15 minute wait even though we preorder the pizza we still waited about 15 minutes before we actually got the pizza. However the pizza is worth the wait. I enjoyed the crust in this pizza more than Giordano's. We had the classic and i would recommend is the sausage and sauce on this pizza is amazing. We had the leftover tonight and it still taste delicious a day after.
