Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I love deep dish and I was definitely looking forward to getting some in Chicago. The pizza was decent but not as good as I expected. Overall, the service was decent as well but I felt a bit pushy in terms of getting a drink (even though I was sitting at the bar). I will have to try out the others to do a proper comparison...
