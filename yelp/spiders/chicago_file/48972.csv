Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Yesterday, there was a party of three and we ordered something from each section, in addition to the paella. My favorite is the shrimp in garlic butter sauce....OMG. The chicken empanadas are excellent as well. We also had the lamb and potatOes with aioli sauce. Â We washed everything dOwn with a pitcher of black berry sangria. You will deff pay for what you get, but always worth it!
