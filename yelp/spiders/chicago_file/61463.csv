Smoque BBQ////Everything we had was good, but nothing was amazing-- except the pecan bread pudding (a seasonal special), which was incredible!. Mac and cheese was solid, but nothing to really write home about. I liked that the coleslaw was cabbage-focused rather than drowning in mayo. The cornbread had decent flavor but was a bit dry.
