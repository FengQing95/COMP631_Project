Little Goat Diner////Came back a different night for a late night dinner. Ordered the korean burger which was good. Who would have thought kimchi on a burger would be so good?? But it works. Then ordered two desserts for the table. I'm not much if a dessert person, but maybe it's because I haven't been eating these desserts. The cake of the day was Elvis which was banana break cake with a peanut butter creme with caramelized bacon bits! We also got a turtle pie - equally as delicious.. Thoroughly impressed both times I've been!
