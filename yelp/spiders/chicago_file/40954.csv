Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I ate here this weekend during a visit to Chicago, and am sad I don't live closer, because I would definitely be back soon!  The asparagus, garlicky shrimp, fresh fried churros, truffle flat bread and stuffed mushrooms were all flavorful and delicious.  I would have given five stars had the bread and parts of the flat bread not been burnt to the point of bitterness, but I would guess this was incidental rather than the norm.  I felt that we got a decent amount of food for a "small plates" set up.
