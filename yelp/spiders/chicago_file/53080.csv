Smoque BBQ////My fav BBQ place in Chicago. I usually get the Beef brisket (chopped) with beans and fries. My girlfriend loves to get the half and half- half pulled pork and half beef brisket. She swears by the mac and cheese, slaw, and peach cobbler. I haven't met a soul who did not like this place. Sometimes the wait can be a little long. Also, they are BYOB. You can't beat it.
