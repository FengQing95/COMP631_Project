Little Goat Diner////The diner itself is worth the wait (and I'm not just talking about the wait from when Stephanie Izard announced Little Goat until when it finally opened - I've been here twice, and waited 45 minutes once and an hour and fifteen the second time) and I love the text system that allows you to wander around or hit up another stop without risk of missing your seat.
