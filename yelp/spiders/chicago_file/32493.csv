Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When I got back to my hotel room I opened the box and it looked amazing. Was still hot and had a cover over the top so the toppings wouldn't get stuck to the lid. I took my first bite and... Nothing. I took another. Same thing. This pizza had ZERO flavor. I felt like I was eating air. Was it me? I took a sip of my tea and it was sweet as usual. I had to ask for salt from the hotel. I ate this pizza but I have never tasted anything with nonexistent flavor in my life. I didn't eat it because I was enjoying it. I ate it because I don't throw food away. I apologize, but I would never recommend this.
