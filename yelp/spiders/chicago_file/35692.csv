Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Last minute, we were looking to celebrate a birthday and enjoy a nice steak with no reservations in mind. Thankfully, Bavette's hold a few tables for walk-in, and considering it was only 5 p.m. or so on a Sunday, we were able to be seated immediately. We had been debating other options, but after a previous visit here, we knew we couldn't go wrong with the food and the ambiance.
