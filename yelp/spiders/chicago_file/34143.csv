Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////You can take anyone here. I can't think of a situation that this place wouldn't work for. Date, client dinner, after a funeral, anything. Did I mention this place is versatile? You can sit at the bar and do a burger, fries, and a PBR for under $20 all-in, or shoot for the moon off the full menu and wine list.
