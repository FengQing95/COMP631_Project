The Purple Pig////We came in the afternoon on a Tuesday and were seated right away. Since we weren't that hungry, we ordered the fried pig's ear and the Sicilian Iris. The pig's ear came with a lot of flavor. Get ready to feel full when ordering this one. The Sicilian Iris was both beautiful to look at and devour. When you cut into it, all the chocolate and ricotta inside oozes out and it's a very sweet and delicious dessert. I'd definitely come back to this restaurant to try their other foods.
