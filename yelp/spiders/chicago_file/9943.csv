Art Institute of Chicago////There's not a lot to add to all the reviews that have been posted about the Art Institute. We spent the day there from opening at 10:30 AM till they closed the place at 5:00 PM. The visitor guide has maps, but they are damned hard to follow, however, employees can help you. There is everything here so whatever your interests are you will find them.
