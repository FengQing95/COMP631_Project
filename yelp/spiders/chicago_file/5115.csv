The Purple Pig////Chicago has quite the food scene and it's easy to see why when you eat somewhere like the Purple Pig, a restaurant serving Mediterranean-inspired cuisine.  Its no secret that they serve up wildly delicious food because at lunch time it was bustling.  They don't take reservations so you might have to wait but it will be worth it.  I would also avoid coming here with a big group because the dining room is kind of small.
