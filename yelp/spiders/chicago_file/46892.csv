Smoque BBQ////Went here for dinner and surprisingly did not have too much trouble finding a parking spot. We went in and ordered and had our food in less than 10 minutes. Just enough time to get our soft drinks and sit down. I had the sliced brisket platter with the mac and cheese, cornbread and slaw, i added the "taste" of the texas sausage. The brisket was juicy and flavorful with just the right amount of smoke, the cornbread was firm but not dry and the mac and cheese was made with real cheese. It was the best BBQ I have had in the Chicago area, save my own. I have to say it was better than the BBQ i had in Texas several weeks ago when I was there. We all enjoyed the peach cobbler for dessert. We even got an additional pound of brisket to take home. I must commend the gentleman runing the front of the house, he kept people moving without really seeming to and helped handle orders to keep line length down. A definite addition to our restaurant list when we are in the city.
