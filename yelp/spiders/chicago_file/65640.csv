Smoque BBQ////After leaving from Lincoln Park Zoo I took a trip over to get a bite for me and the family. I loved how the business took covid precautions the way they did. Proper PPE required and they even took customer's temperatures for those dining outside. Food was great, 50 dollars worth filled 4 individuals which included a St. Louis rib dinner with Mac and cheese, beans, and cornbread. Next meal was chopped brisket with another Mac and cheese and cornbread with coleslaw. For dessert tried the peach cobbler.
