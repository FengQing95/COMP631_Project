Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Whoever did the interior decorating to this place did an impressive job. It's warm and inviting, yet intimate and romantic. You feel like you walked into another era, I don't know if it's the 1920's or the 1960's... I'm no historian so forgive me... Looking around makes me feel like I'm watching scenes from a movie, only with modern dressed and trendy looking diners throughout the restaurant. Even the bartenders' outfits add to the atmosphere.
