Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is hands down my #1 go-to spot. Definitely get the seasonal sangria, brussel sprout salad, burrata, and bacon wrapped dates.  Sometimes you can hit this place when it's super busy, but if you're okay with a bar seat you can usually slide on in if you keep an eye out.  Haven't found another spot that's nice, yet not pretentious, and the vibe feels relaxed but you feel like you're treating yourself like this spot.
