Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place was phenomenal my friend introduced me to tapas and I am now a beleiver they have so much to choose from spicy garlic shrimp was delicious. Spicy potatoes were amazing. Goat cheese is to die for. Morrocan with spiced chicken was ok. The flank steak was awesome soft and delightful service was fantastic couldn't even get to the bottom of my glass of water without somebody filling my glass.. No complaints
