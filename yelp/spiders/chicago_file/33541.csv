Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband and I made a reservation for Bavette's at 8:45PM on a Sunday evening and we're glad we did as the restaurant was packed and the wait quite long without a reservation. Â We were seated by the window and our server came promptly to greet us. He was very nice and attentive. Looking over their menu everything sounded amazing. We decided to start with the bone marrow, salmon tartare, and share the classic rib-eye, Chicago-cut with sides of broccoli and wild mushrooms. For drinks we ordered a bottle of red wine.
