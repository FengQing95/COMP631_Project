The Purple Pig////Showed up around 115, and we're promptly sat outside. Took a few minutes for the waiter to showed up, but it was sort of busy so we weren't too concerned. When he came over, he didn't introduce himself, just asked what we wanted, and when we told him we hadn't been there before he just said okay and walked off. If this guy would've put in ANY effort, he could've pushed our tab up another 30-40 bucks. Any way, this apparently is a hip place to get lunch, so bad service was to be expected.
