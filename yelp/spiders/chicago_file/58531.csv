Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The back of the restaurant is great for groups. Round tables which make for easy conversation, and the space is dark with soft lighting. Makes for a very warm and intimate space (only downside is that it is really loud, we went on a Thursday night). The bar has small tables by the window which are really cute for a good date spot.
