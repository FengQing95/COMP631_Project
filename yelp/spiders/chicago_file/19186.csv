Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As a disclaimer, deep dish pizza shouldn't be enjoyed frequently. As pretty much a life-long Chicago-ian, I would say my intake of deep dish depend strictly on the number of out-of-towners that pass through this glorious city. So when time comes to satisfy the curiosities of the passing by tourist, my preference is to set time aside for Lou Malnati's offering.
