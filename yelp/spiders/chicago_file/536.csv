Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Delicious food!  If you are looking to indulge a bit this is the place.  Instead of toast, you can substitute pancakes and trust me it's worth it.  I had the chocolate chip (for a $1 more) and they were perfect.  My boyfriend had the cinnamon roll pancakes with his hash and he said they were hands down the best pancakes he's had.  I highly recommend going, especially if it's a "cheat day".
