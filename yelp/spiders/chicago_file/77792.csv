Little Goat Diner////Little Goat Diner is one of those places you pass and you think, "must be good to have that many people waiting in line." You know what?  It's true.  It's really good.  It wasn't the best meal of my life, but their menu is creative and yet still approachable for people who aren't super adventurous (read: me).  We (party of two) visited around 12:30 pm on a Sunday afternoon.  After being told it would be an hour AND forty-five minutes to be seated (first available, not outside), we set off to discover new parts of West Loop.  Somehow, only twenty minutes went by before I received a text letting me know our two spots at the counter were available.
