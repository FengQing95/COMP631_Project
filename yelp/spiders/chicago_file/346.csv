Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////12 of us ordered lunch for carry out on a Saturday. Some of the food we ordered: cobb salad, southwestern salad, seared tuna salad, cheese burger, omelet, prime rib french dip, and chicken club. The pretzel rolls that came with the salads were delicious. Most of everything was fresh and tasty. The only issues were that someone didn't get the correct salad and the seared tuna was not filleted correctly as it had some chewiness to it.
