Art Institute of Chicago////The impressionism collection is astounding, though its really the American artworks that transcend our collective subconscious with classics like Grant Wood's "American Gothic" and Edward Hopper's "Nighthawks". Unfortunately, those pieces are currently hidden away during the massive renovation, but the upside is the projected 2009 opening of the Modern Art Wing, which will bridge the museum directly with the increasingly glorious Millennium Park.
