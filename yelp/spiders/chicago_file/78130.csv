Little Goat Diner////Once seated, in a booth with torn upholstery and very worn out springs, I ordered a burger with goat meat and cheddar instead of American cheese, and the corn elotes as a $7 side. The bun was brioche and well on the way to being burnt. Burnt was the overwhelming flavor of this burger. The cheese was American, not cheddar. Other than the meat, it was a mushy mess. The goat meat itself was fine. Â The corn elotes were good but would have been happier with half the portion.
