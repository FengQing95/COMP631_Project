Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Well aware of the 30-35 minute wait for the pizza, I plunked myself down and soaked in the surroundings while I awaited my 6" Lou's Chicago Classic.  As soon as I took my first bite, I knew right away that this was no Zachary's...it was that much better.  I was never much of a fan of the former's deep dish - excessive amounts of bland tomatoes and just gobs of dough with some cheese.  Here, there was significantly better balance.  The bright flavors of the tomatoes present up front and then step aside to let the gooey cheese and delightfully crunchy crust take center stage.  It's hard to make crust that one actually enjoys and the Buttercrust at Lou Malnati's definitely lives up to its name.
