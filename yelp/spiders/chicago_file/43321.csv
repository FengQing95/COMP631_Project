Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Coming to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba has been a slight family tradition. The most recent visit was for Father's Day and I wasn't disappointed. I wanted to order something my father hasn't had before so I ordered the bacon wrapped dates. They were amazing. My dad said it tasted like heaven and his date couldn't get enough of them.
