Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My boyfriend and my favorite brunch spot. We normally spend $60 here: 2x $10 bloody Mary's, we normally split 4 tapas. We just started using our LettuceEats app to get cash promotions and love it! They're amazing for dinner as well. Love the passion sangria! We always post up at the bar for brunch so no waiting in line!
