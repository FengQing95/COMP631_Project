Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been to Baba Reeba many, many times over my 8 years living in Chicago.  They have always delivered.  My last experience was terrible...service, food, we didn't even get some of the dishes we ordered, yet were charged for them.  This time was TOTALLY different.  The food was uh-may-zing.  service was absolutely spot on!  they have changed up the menu and let me tell you it is for the best!  Please try the rainbow chard!  divine!  the shrimp in garlic and olive oil never disappoints, bacon wrapped dates (duh), chicken empanada, pintxos platter, scallops, paella (the best my friend says he has EVER had), fried green peppers, cava sangria to wash it all down, I could go on!  they have a pajama brunch on New Year's day...check it out!  you will NOT be disappointed!
