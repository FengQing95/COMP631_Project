Smoque BBQ////One of the best in Chicago. If you like ribs Q has better. 4.5 stars. They actually cook ribs the proper way by smoking it.  It's the only legit way of making ribs and meats tender and juicy.  You'll know what I mean when you try the boiled ribs that are so prevalent around town. Yes, Im talking to you Twin Anchors.
