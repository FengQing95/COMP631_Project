Little Goat Diner////Looking at the menu was an overwhelming experience because everything looks delish. I chose the soup of the day, a strawberry gazpacho (!!) and the fish tostadas. Really, there aren't enough words to describe how awesome they were. The pictures just don't do them justice. There was a little heat with the gazpacho, but it was still sweet like you'd expect. The tostadas were incredible as well; just the right amount of fish, guacamole, and other toppings.
