Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////If you like tapas, it is definitely worth checking out. The bacon wrapped dates were phenomenal as was the spicy potatoes and spinach stuffed mushrooms. The restaurant is huge although there are only two outside tables. The sangria is amazing-I believe they have a nightly special. Definitely a cool atmosphere and worth a visit if you're in the area.
