Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For sides we went with our bartender's suggestions of the hash browns and the elote style corn.  I'm not really sure how elote style corn fits into this menu but I don't really care, it was delicious!  The hash browns are a must-order, I can assure you that you've never had hash browns like these before.
