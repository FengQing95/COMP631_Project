Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Now. Desserts. We ordered salted caramel ice cream. OMGoodness. They also provided 2 toppings: hot fudge and goldbrick. Listen. This goldbrick was life altering. I'm usually a hot fudge fan but the goldbrick was amazing! If you've ever eaten a Haagen Daz ice cream bar with nuts...it tastes exactly like the chocolate coating! She also brought a slice of chocolate pie for us to taste. It has fresh whipped cream and was soooooo decadent.
