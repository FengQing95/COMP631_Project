Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Once it arrived, our waiter cut it in 4 slices and we dug in. IT WAS SO DELICIOUS! I added some red pepper on it and it was literally perfection. Having two slices each was more than enough and it was a struggle near the end to finish it. I understand why this place is so popular! They also let you buy frozen pizzas to take home o_O
