Little Goat Diner////Bloody mary's are stuffed with goat cheese - how clever!  I got the Bullseye French toast and it knocked my socks off.  Not a lot of healthy options on this menu, just flavorful, unique combinations!  It's a pretty big space with nice large booths and tables.  We got seated pretty quickly but there is also a bar to sit at and get a drink while you wait.
