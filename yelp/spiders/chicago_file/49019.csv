Smoque BBQ////The ribs were good.  Not the best I've ever had, not falling off the bone tender, but good.  The sauce was a little spicier than I expected; I literally broke out in a sweat eating the ribs with the sauce.  It's cool if they want to go spicy, but they should give customers a choice between mild or spicy sauce.  The cornbread was phenomenal; the coleslaw was even delicious and I hate coleslaw.  But the ribs need some work; they just aren't what they are cracked up to be.
