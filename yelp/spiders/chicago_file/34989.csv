Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I will start with hostess, made reservations on Monday night she was extremely rude, put us down in dungeon service was good when we were the only table, food awesome. As soon as it got busier service declined fast. Worst music ever! Not sure if I will come back!  Luckily when I yelped from table it didn't go through, steaks took five minutes, dessert 25 minutes....still waiting!
