Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We started out in a small table next to the door. A little uncomfortable because of the constant wind in and out, when we asked if we could move we were quickly accommodated and moved to a booth farther away! We got the pepperoni  with  butter crust suggested by our server, soooo good!! Would highly recommend and if we make our way to Chicago again we we definitely be back!
