Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My Wedge Salad was just okay. Maybe 2/10. The thick bacon is lovely, but doesn't save an otherwise boring salad. Maybe if I got more dressing on the side? My biggest problem is that it was two pretty large iceberg lettuce wedges with some crumbled blue cheese and the bacon, covered with a modicum of dressing. Soon, all I was eating was undressed iceberg--which, obviously, is the epitome of no-taste/unexciting.
