Little Goat Diner////Not sure what the fuss is about. I love to eat, but couldn't find anything appetizing on the menu. Too weird. Unexpected variations? Yeah, but not very appealing to me. Maybe I'm missing something, perhaps, but I'm not going to waste my time again.... I'd rather go somewhere where the food is actually TASTY!
