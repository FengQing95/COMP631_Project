Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We went an hour before closing,  but the place was still packed. We were seated right away, No reservations,  but service was slow & we had 4 or 5 different servers, which threw me off a bit. I guess I'm being picky, but no heads up about it...me likes to build a rapport with whoever is going to be handling my food, ya heard?
