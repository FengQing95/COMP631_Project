Art Institute of Chicago////Now my rant and why I don't give AIC 5 stars. Because every special exhibit I attend has artwork hung with labels that are annoyingly discrete. The Magritte exhibit this summer is just the latest example. The labels were done in some sort of brown type on a tan background and mounted adjacent to artworks in near darkness. I and all my fellow exhibit-goers were forced to do the cha-cha to read the labels: move up close & peer at the label trying to read the small font; move back to view the work and what the label described; move up again to re-read something I missed; and back again. We all tried to do this while not stumbling over each other or blocking someone's view. Over and over. Ridiculous. The recorded tour didn't help; it covered only a few works and in addition, people tended to hold the handsets flat like smartphones so the galleries echoed with the constant chatter of the recordings. Ugh. Â I understand the desire not to detract from the artwork but the fact is, people really want to understand what they are seeing. Better label solutions would help a lot.
