Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The line on a Sunday night (Labour day weekend) was out the door.  After being told that the wait time was 1.5 hours, we decided to get take out instead.  The wait time for this was only 35 min.  After window shopping in the nearby expensive (but really modern) furniture stores, we returned to pick up our food.
