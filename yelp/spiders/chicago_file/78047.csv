Little Goat Diner////We also ordered hash browns for the table, which were a perfect crispy consistency and the cheese was merged into the dish perfectly. My dining partners ordered the chocolate pancake and the...dish with smoked salmon I forget what it was called...and they both heartily enjoyed their dishes as well as their coffees with goat milk.
