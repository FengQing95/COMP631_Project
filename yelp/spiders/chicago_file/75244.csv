Little Goat Diner////8:48pm - the customers are still seated and squatting already having paid and are just chatting. we are seated in a desperate attempt by management in TWO separate booths. This offer was ridiculous- and defeats the purpose of a celebratory meal by separating and closing off the parties. At this point, feeling defeated and experiencing the intense hunger 6months of pregnancy brings - I obliged.
