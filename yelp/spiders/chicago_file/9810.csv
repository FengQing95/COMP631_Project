Art Institute of Chicago////The highlight for me was the collection in the new, modern wing. They have a spectacular collection of work by the surrealists Dali, Magritte, Tanguy, Max Ernst, and my absolute favorite Gorgio de Chirico. There were many moments where I'd turn a corner and get goosebumps at the sight of something fabulous I've only ever seen in a book.
