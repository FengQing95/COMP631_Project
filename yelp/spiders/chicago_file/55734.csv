Smoque BBQ////Very annoying. They don't serve beer but soon realized you could've brought your own. I like to hear the Blues when I'm in a BBQ joint. I know there was something playing but couldn't really hear it. I had the St. Louis 1/2 slab, beans, mac n cheese. The ribs were good and tender, chewy but falling off the bone. The Memphis sauce "ok", it seemed very heavy on the chili powder side. The beans were very smokey. I mean too smokey. We didn't like them. My daughter had the pulled pork and enjoyed it. She didn't like the Carolina sauce and I tried that sauce and agreed. The cole slaw was terrible. I've had vinegar based slaw before, numerous times, and it's good with certain BBQ, but this was not tasty. The service was great. The young man clearing the tables and trays was very nice and seemed to be on top of things. Prices were reasonable.
