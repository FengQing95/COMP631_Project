Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////First off, I'm a Taurus, MAY birthday people. The place was pitch black at 5:00. Way to set the mood...for my sister, parents, best friend and daughter. We ordered a lot. The waiter creeped me out. "You wanted the salads BEFORE your entrees?" Um, usually, but we're flexible. Wtf. You want another glass of wine? It's number 2, not 9, and so what of it was. Food was good, not even close to great.
