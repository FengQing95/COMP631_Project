Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Loved everything that I had, from the atmosphere to the food. The 10oz filet mignon was worth every single penny. The sweet potatoes as a side are phenomenal as well are the mashed potatoes. Truffle Mac & cheese! Amazing a must. I'm not a seafood kind of person. But the crab cake my wife and friends were having did look amazing since they left nothing on the plate lol. I like my steak medium well with very to little pink. My server offered medium well + which I haven't heard of, it turned out to be the best damn filet mignon I have ever had! Can't wait to go back again!!!!!
