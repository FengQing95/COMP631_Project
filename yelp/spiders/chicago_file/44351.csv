Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////A few months later, I met up with a couple of friends for dinner. I walked in through the hallway and I instantly fell in love with the atmosphere. Big legs of serrano ham hang from the ceiling next to the bar and the open kitchen. It's a pretty amazing sight. Then we had the sangria, paella and a couple of tapas. The waitress must have told the manager we are new to this place because he came up to us and introduced himself. Oh, and by the way, he brought us three kinds of desserts ON THE HOUSE. Ahh, lovely.
