Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Crust: Lou Malnati's takes on a close second to Giordano's for sure, but barring anything else they are both essentially equal. Flaky and crispy butter crust, never burnt. I will knock on the fact that typically because Lou's and Gino's has smaller pizzas than Giordano's, the ratio of dough to ingredients seems to be greater. Still crispy and delicious though.
