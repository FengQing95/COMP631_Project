Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Then comes the best part - the pizza!!! We'd tried the Lou and the Chicago Traditional one on Friday night, and my heart ached for the veggies of the lou... but my stomach said I needed protein. So, we created the best pizza I've ever had - the lou + sausage! This was the thickest, most delicious, fresh pizza EVER!!! I only wished I were hungry enough to finish another slice. The veggies taste great, especially the mushrooms and roma tomatoes. It does take around 30-45mins for the pies to cook, but I promise, they're worth the wait!
