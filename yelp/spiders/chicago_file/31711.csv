Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////5. The system at Giordano's in regards to getting a table in one line, ordering pizza in another, standing in a huge crowd in a small cramped in place waiting for your table, then ordering the rest of your meal once you sit was very confusing. There's literally no where I saw that really explained the process. We just trialed and failed our way thru the process until we finally got it right. We also came in the day before and realized after the fact we didn't that's 2-3 hours to kill for pizza so we left and came back the next day. A heads up, like this review, would have been nice before we went and waisted our time.
