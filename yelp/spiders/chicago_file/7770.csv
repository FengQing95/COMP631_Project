Art Institute of Chicago////However, the people that were there were very polite and you could tell were really appreciative of the art on display. I know I was. This Museum is also located in a really cool side of town, and makes for a great walking location in good weather. Next time I'm local I will be sure to come back, I had a bunch of fun.
