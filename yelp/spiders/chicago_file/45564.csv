Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Bacon wrapped dates- There are a lot of very favorable reviews for these and the waiter enthusiastically recommended it. It was ok but I think I just need to admit to myself I'm not a fan of dates. I've tried several supposedly amazing date dishes at several restaurants but never really enjoyed any of them. If you like dates, maybe this dish is good. If not, this dish won't change your mind.
