Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I enjoy being able to order a combo that includes eggs cooked my way, multiple choices of meats, AND 2 fluffy pancakes.  I have tried both scrambled eggs and an omelette.  I'd pick the scrambled.  Both could use a little more flavor though.  And best of all, the prices are very reasonable.
