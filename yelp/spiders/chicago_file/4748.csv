The Purple Pig////The only criticism is that the restaurant was a little too loud for me to hear my friend comfortably.  And because it's on Michigan avenue, it's also extremely busy, even for a Thursday evening.  We ended up having a slight mix-up with one of our dishes and didn't get it until much later.  But it was the octopus dish and well worth the wait!
