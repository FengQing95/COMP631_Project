Smoque BBQ////tried the pulled pork sandwich the other day. thought the meat was pretty tasty but when i happened to take a peak at their bottled bbq sauces they had for sale, both the original and the spicy flavors had high fructose corn syrup and anyone who knows anything about bbq is even at a high volume place such as Smoque, its a no no in terms of taste compared to regular sugar. so that was a picky turn off for me.
