Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The dry aged ribeye is nutty, funky and the best steak I've seen. Served on the bone, it is seared to med rare all the way around. Juicy, buttery. A pure marvel of steak cooking skill that is perfect for an addition of bernaise sauce. Marbled fat lines the meat throughout - a steak knife is nearly superfluous.
