Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Traditional Filet mignon boneless cut melts in your mouth, I ordered rare and I got one that was medium, it was okay, but charred on the outside as well.  I notified the server and he immediately apologized and sent it back to the kitchen.  I guess the only way to turn medium rare back into rare was to start a new piece and the rare version was so much better.
