Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We are sat downstairs in the back, almost in the middle of the room.  Not really an ideal place for an empty restaurant, but we said fuck it, we were hungry.  The friendly waiter approached our table quickly and took our drink order.  I knew he was a good waiter, because the Sangria was in our bellies before we even picked up our menus.  Unfortunately our waiter was no longer our waiter anymore.  Another waiter would be taking over since he was leaving.  But before he left, he answered any of our questions, took our order, and topped off our glasses of Sangria.  Our food arrived little by little from the kitchen.  The prosciutto and tomato bread were nice and refreshing.  All else were ummmm....I don't even remember what we had.  Paella was decent.....and ummm, yeah, not sure where our new waiter is.  We have to flag him down to order some more shit.  The food was not impressive, and the service was a joke (not including our first waiter of 10 minutes).  My lady even told me she used to love this joint.  Not so much anymore.  I on the other hand never loved this place.....and never will.
