Smoque BBQ////not sure if it's because I was tired...but I have the feeling that they just want you to get out of there as soon as you can. This is definitely not a place to sit and enjoy your meal, but a place for you to eat and go! I order the sliced brisket sandwich which was OK, simply ok, nothing that great, BF ordered the pulled pork and he liked it, fingers liked and all. Can't complain about the waiting time, 5 min top on a busy night. Personally I prefer to sit, relax, and enjoy my meal, so 3 stars it is, sorry Smoque not impressed!
