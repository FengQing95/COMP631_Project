Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is theeeee spot to go my Yelp friends! Yes, Yes, Yessss! It gets mighty crowded, so do be wary of a lil wait time. But it is worth it, I promise you! There are both bottom and top floor seating options. They prompt you to order the pizza you want up front since it takes 40 minutes to cook, then you wait to be seated!
