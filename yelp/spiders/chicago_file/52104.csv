Smoque BBQ////They have 2 sauces - Memphis style: sweet, molasses-y, thick and the South Carolina: thinner and vinegar-y. I usually prefer the tangier S Carolina, but theirs is tangy, but not much smoke or spice - The fell I was with said it was good on whatever he was eating. I found it to be 'meh' I actually really enjoyed the Memphis style - well balanced, smoky and not too sweet. Good texture too; stuck to my meat but not gooey.
