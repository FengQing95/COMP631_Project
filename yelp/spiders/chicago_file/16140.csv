Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm not one to give out 5-star ratings easily, but Lou Malnati's is definitely deserving.  Planning a trip to Chicago, I've realized that there is not one definitive "Chicago deep dish" pizza place.  Everyone you talk to has a different opinion, and every place has tons of reviews that say "this place is good, but it's nothing compared to so-and-so".  Ultimately, I figure you just have to keep coming back to Chicago and trying new places until you find the one for you.
