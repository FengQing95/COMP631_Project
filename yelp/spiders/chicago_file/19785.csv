Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Best Deep Dish Pizza in Chicago! We arrived just before the rush, little before Noon. There was about a 15 minute wait. Shortly after it filled up. The place is rather large plenty of seating for groups/families and etc. We started off with the wings, they came out hot and crisp, the seasoning had a slight kick which was well warranted. We had them without the wing sauces. Absolutely delicious. For pizza we had the pepperoni and sausage deep dish. Tip go for the smaller size than you would normally get. Overall Great experience and should be added to your places to stop in Chicago!
