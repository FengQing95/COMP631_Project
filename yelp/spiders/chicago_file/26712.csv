Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I am a pizza snob and usually seek out the Neapolitan style pizzas.  My wife and I were staying in downtown Chicago for a trade convention and didn't want to pass up the opportunity to experience deep dish pizza in the town that is known for it.  After much research, we decided on Lou Malnati's.  There are several locations and we choose the one closest to our hotel.  We had to wait 5 minutes for a table and the place was packed.  A larger group would probably have a longer wait at dinner time.
