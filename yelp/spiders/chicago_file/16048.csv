Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////A good friend recommended us to try this pizzeria. The place is a great. Everything you would want in a restaurant including sports bar. Wide variety, fresh ingredients, friendly and attentive staff. Try deep dish pizza and salad. They get really busy though and walk in wait is long (must be good sign) so book your reservation ahead of time. You will not regret going here.
