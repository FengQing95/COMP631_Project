Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was recommended to us by a tour guy as a super place to experience Chicago deep dish pizza. There are several locations. Ours was in a basement setting near the river. OK is the best we can say. The service was quick and friendly. The pizzas (we're from California and had heard of Chicago deep dish pizzas as something special) were OK. Not nearly spicy enough (oregano, etc.) The small size was plenty of food to take back to the hotel. Atmosphere so-so. Service quick. The waiter said it would take 30 to 45 minutes to get the pizzas (about the size of a round cake pan), so because we were hungry, we ordered brushetta to tide us over. The pies came out right away. I we ever come back to Chicago, this won't be a "must" for us.
