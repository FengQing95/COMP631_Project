Smoque BBQ////I recently had an event and had Smoque cater the food. I was so impressed by how great everyone was to work with at Smoque. I ordered 48 hours in advance. It wasn't a problem at all. They were super fast when I went to pick up the food (on a busy Sat. night). Everything was right with the order and they were extremely personable to work with. I highly recommend the catering option, even if it's just for a tailgate. Everyone at my party was very impressed by the food!
