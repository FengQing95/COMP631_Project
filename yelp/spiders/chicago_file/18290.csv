Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////There's something about Chicago pizza that just doesn't compare to any other. Staff was also very friendly. This is probably the only time I will ever order deep dish pizza because it's worth. This place looks small from the outside but it's pretty spacious once you get inside. I ordered a lunch special pizza which is very convenient, small and still delicious. Definitely coming back here on my next visit.
