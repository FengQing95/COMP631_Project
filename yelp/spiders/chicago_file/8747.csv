Art Institute of Chicago////Great collection. You could easily spend the day here. If you're visiting from out of town I highly recommend making this a sightseeing priority. And, if you're a Bank of America account holder take advantage of their 'Museums On Us Program' and enjoy FREE ADMISSION if you visit during the first full weekend of the month.
