Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Visiting from southern California, we picked this restaurant for breakfast on a very busy Saturday morning.  Aside from the over an hour and half wait for being seated which was rather testing, the food was good, the service was in par with what was expected, and if crowded and noisy atmospheres are not of a concern, you would be well served here.  Of note was the unique cinnamon (roll) pancake which I highly recommend.
