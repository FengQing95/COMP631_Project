Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////In general i find i prefer the chicago stuffed pie deep dish to my more familiar NY style thin crust i grew up on, but malnati's falls somewhere in the middle. Â reminiscent of the old pizza hut deep dish done with better ingredients and quality perhaps but similar outcome.
