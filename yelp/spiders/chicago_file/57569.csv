Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ordered the brunch tapas menu for delivery during Restaurant Week. Enormous portions, excellent food (the best flan and French toast were some of the best I have had in a while), and a complimentary sangria with each meal. Excellent value for money, delivered right to your door! We are looking forward to visiting in person once we're vaccinated.
