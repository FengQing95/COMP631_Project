Smoque BBQ////My fianc√© loves this place! He loves meat and BBQ so it's a perfect match for him. Obviously, it is a smokehouse....being a pescatarian I had a difficult time picking foods for my diet. I was hopeful the restaurant would have at least 2 salads...nope. They had only one and it was nothing special. Maybe in the future they will create more salads?! Once again, great place for BBQ lovers but limited options for specialty diets.
