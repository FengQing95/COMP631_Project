Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of my favorite tapas restaurants ever. The menu is expansive, the sangria is delicious, and the food is very flavorful and consistent. The menu is a bit dated, but if it's not broken, don't fix it I guess. The best time to come here is actually happy hour, when all the best menu items are half off-- including their famous sangria.
