Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The atmosphere was really amazing and you can't help but take it all in once you enter the restaurant. I ordered the filet mignon and the fries with carrot cake for dessert which were all amazing but what topped it off was the wonderful server who brought us the bone marrow appetizer on the house just because she heard us talking about it.
