Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Finally, an under-cooked, still-frozen, inedible large deep-dish pie was dropped at our table at 10:15pm, over 2.5 hours after taking the order. Truly unbelievable, even as I write this 24 hours later. The pizza-brained waitress couldn't even cut it because it was rock-hard, and yet served it anyway. Of course we showed her that it was still frozen, and she could only muster up a 'sorry' before running away to hide in the kitchen. My wife is pregnant, and you served her a plate of still-frozen, raw dough. Absolutely maddening!
