Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////So this is one of the first places I took my now hubby about 25 years ago when Cafe Baba Reeba first opened. To this day, the Tapas are fantastic.  We has the Baked goat cheese, the roasted bacon wrapped dates, the Grilled  Ibérico Pork, the meatballs and the chicken paella all for 2 people and left fat and happy. We will be back!
