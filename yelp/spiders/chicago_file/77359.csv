Little Goat Diner////My first time here and it was delicious! My boyfriend and I shared a cookies and cream milkshake... delicious. I ordered a cup of the soup of the day (cheesy pickle) which was good and my boyfriend ordered a side Caesar salad to start. We ordered the shrimp & pork belly (AMAZING) and broiled chicken (yummy as well). Overall great experience, we will be back!
