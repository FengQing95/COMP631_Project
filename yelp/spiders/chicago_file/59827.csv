Smoque BBQ////I'd say that Smoque--because of its somewhat obscure location--is a little-known Chicago gem, except that the long lines prove me otherwise.  This place is worth going out of your way for.  I love the ribs, the corn bread, and the chili, but I've never had a meal I didn't like here.   A year ago, my husband initiated a BBQ comparison, in which we ate meals from Smoque and the more trendily located Fat Willy's side by side.  For both its rub and its sauces, Smoque won by a landslide.  Keep up the great work!
