Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Upbeat, modern breakfast/brunch place that benefits from marketing savvy, but doesn't deliver on taste. Blueberry pancakes were dry & doughy. Omelet smacked of hotel warming tray fare & hash browns were reminiscent of frozen bagged stuff. Waitress pleasant, but seemed more schooled in how to appear warm & interested instead of putting forth the genuine article. 3/3 of us were disappointed. Â Not awful, in a pinch, but not where I'd bring friends to show off Chi town.
