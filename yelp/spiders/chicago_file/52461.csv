Smoque BBQ////...and into a disappointing, hot mess.  I knew I was in trouble from the beginning when I ordered a half slab and requested the large end.  Not only did the order taker not know what the large end was, but when asked she informed me that customers usually do not specify which end of the slab they want (note taken about the customers).  I was also certain at this point that the fries would not be served nestled beneath the ribs or that 2 pieces of white bread would be found atop my ribs, but that is all forgivable.  I also ordered the pulled pork taste and brisket taste.
