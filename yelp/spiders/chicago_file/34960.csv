Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I really dislike steak houses. A good steak is not worth the sacrifice of the tacky ambiance, high prices, and the mediocre sides and seafood that I associate with traditional Chicago steak houses. While Bavette's is indeed, in a way, a steak house (and will probably still appeal to anyone who is a steak house fan), there were definitely no sacrifices required here.
