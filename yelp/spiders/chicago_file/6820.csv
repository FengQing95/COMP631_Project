Art Institute of Chicago////This is my favorite museum. I prefer to go alone with a sketch book and some markers. I like that they allow photographs - just no flash. The garden caf√© is a good place to get a bite and then hit the second half of the exhibits in the rest of the afternoon. When you go allow your self as much time as possible. I have spent the entire day there several times and I leave feeling that it was not enough. The gift shop is amazing. I purchase a keep sake every time I visit.
