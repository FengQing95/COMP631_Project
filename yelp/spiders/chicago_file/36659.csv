Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Very, very close to 5*; one could make arguments either way.  So here's the beef - sorry - upfront: too little seasoning on the steak, which arrived unadorned, not even salt.  That's it: in my judgement, for a steakhouse, that's a significant error and it's enough to dock them a star, but ymmv.  At $70 for _just_ a steak, standards are pretty damn high.
