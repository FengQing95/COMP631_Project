Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Appetizer and dinner were wonderful.  The bone marrow was fantastic and the short rib stroganoff was incredible.  The chocolate cream pie for dessert was too rich to finish and didn't complement the meal well.  A gentleman at a table close to me got the lemon meringue pie.  The meringue was so tall it was challenging for him to eat and he left most of his dessert as well.  Service started off great, but got very slow as the evening wore on--after getting the dessert menu, it was about 7 - 10 minutes before I could order.  I was there close to closing time so this may have played a part, but I did leave before their official closing time so would expect service to not drop off this way.  Also, since the place was close to closing, they were no longer particularly busy.  They don't advertise that they have house wines for $6.  When every other glass is at least $10, this was a helpful find since the house red was very good.  Overall a very good experience, but just skip dessert at this location.
