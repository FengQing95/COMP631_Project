Smoque BBQ////Omg this place is delicious!!! Everyone must definitely give it a try. When I come here I usually get the St. Louis ribs along with BBQ beans. The ribs are tender and have a smoky taste to them. The staff is always willing to answer any questions. I normally take my ribs to go, because it's always packed with hungry people :)
