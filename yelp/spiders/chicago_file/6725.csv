The Purple Pig////She also took the time to share some of her favorite spots to dine - one of them being The Purple Pig. According to her the food was not only visually appetizing but memorable in flavor. It was the one place that she really wanted me to try and I'm glad she did. Everything about the service was non- discriminating. Being that I was not properly dressed for an evening out I was a bit worried that my overly casual attire would draw some negative attention; perhaps even a refusal to seat us due to Â dress preferences. Luckily that wasn't the case! The host was pleasant and he graciously seated us almost immediately.
