Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza was super disappointing. The crust was yeasty and underdone, I believe, and not as buttery flavored as I would have imagined it would be. It was pretty bland and actually...quite healthy tasting. Normally I have one slice of deep dish and that is ENOUGH. My mom and I ended up finishing a small pizza.
