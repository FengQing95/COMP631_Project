Little Goat Diner////Let's talk food first. I had a duck banh mi sandwich. Duck in two forms -- confit and duck liver mousse. Pickled veggies added a great crunch while not overpowering the flavor of the duck. Baguette was crisp on the outside and soft inside and held up nicely against the richness of the filling.
