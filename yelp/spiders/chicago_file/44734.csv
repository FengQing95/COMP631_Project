Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The atmostphere at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is amazing. Dark lighting gives a romantic kind of feel that off sets from the rush of the restaurant. The food is wonderful. Personally I like tapas because you are able to try so many things. I recently went on a date here and we were able to get 4 tapas which was the perfect amount: brussel sprout salad, cheese platter, bacon wrapped dates, and the scallops. The sangria is a must have.
