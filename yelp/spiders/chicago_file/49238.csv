Smoque BBQ////I went to Smoque one night when the meat was just dry and not-so-good, but every other time I have been it was wonderful.  I am not a fan of the communal seating, the waiting in line to order, and the funky way they take care of seating, but the food makes it worth it.   I didn't much care for the brisket chili, but everything else I have had has been delicious.  The staff has always been very nice.  I would recommend the place.  There is a small parking lot in the back that is free, but not easily seen!
