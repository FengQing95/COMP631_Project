Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For me, this was definitely the one to go to! Ordered the typical Chicago special as I couldn't have anything else. Crust was perfect and crunchy and even the bottom of the pizza was in tact w/o any sauce seeping through to the bottom making it soggy. We loved it. A small is definitely enough for 2 people.
