Art Institute of Chicago////I loved getting lost in the different rooms and seeing so much beauty around us.  Whether it's from a different time, a different country, or a different religion.  All of the staff were there to help and really friendly too.  The bathrooms were clean and though you could easily get lost in here there is someone near by to help you find your way or that one piece of art in the brochure that you just have to see in person!   My boyfriend and I have a real appreciation for art and visiting the art institute was a spontaneous and random activity we ended up fully enjoying.
