Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////They no longer serve bread and butter with the tapas and essential part of tapas, take away one star. The tortilla was all burnt brown on the bottom and it was served warm not chilled , take away another star. The goat cheese with tomato sauce had no taste at all , minus another star. The overall experience was weak minus a star. The dates with bacon got them the one star they earned. Not going back for a while, till they improve their game. Have been eating there since the mid 90s, so I remember when it supposed to be like!
