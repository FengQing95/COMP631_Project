Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Last time I visited here I went ahead and picked a pre-set pizza. This time around, I went ahead and customized it, ensuring that it would come out hot and fresh from the oven. For those wanting to experience the goodness of the crust here, this is the ONLY way to go. Order ahead of time if you mind the wait, but just make sure its customized so you get the freshest, hottest pizza. It makes all the difference.
