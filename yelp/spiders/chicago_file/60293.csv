Smoque BBQ////My food was picture perfect. In fact, I took a few shots myself. I make the perfect bite consisting of my pulled pork sandwich and and some of the peppery slaw. The meat was juicy and tender accompanied by a warm soft bun and that slaw. Utterly amazing. The ribs were tender and fell right off the bone goodness. I was a little ashamed that I might need to do some bib action because I wanted to shove it all in my mouth and I didn't want to stain my new white tee. I refrained from making a bib from paper towels but I still ate like a maniac. The meat wasn't over powered by crazy spices and the flavor of the meat was very pronounced with the right amount of smoke.The sauces are all made from scratch. The BBQ sauce was sweet, tangy, and with the right amount of spice. The mac and cheese was light and fluffy, it didn't stand a chance.
