Little Goat Diner////The food at little goat was absolutely amazing! The Mac and cheese was to die for!  It had a very original and unique taste.   It was so great we forgot to take a pic of it! Also, we ordered the Tuna melt.. Oh so good!  It was unique as well and the best tuna melt I've ever tasted.  We also ordered the smoked fries and chicken fingers.... Another great pick! Yum yum!  I must say the bbq sauce that comes with the chicken fingers was wonderful. It made my chicken fingers 100% better... If that's even possible!!  I love it here and will definitely recommend this restaurant!  A+
