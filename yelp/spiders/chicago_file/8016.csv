Art Institute of Chicago////There's an inner Monet fanatic within me yearning to break free. It was liberated at last during my trip here on a rainy Sunday afternoon. I'm an art layman/novice/retard/whatever you want to call me. If you are too, I promise you can come here and be thrilled and captivated by the best visual expression the human race has to offer.
