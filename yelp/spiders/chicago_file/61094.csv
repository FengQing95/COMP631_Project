Smoque BBQ////After hearing from many people that Smoque has amazing bbq, we finally decided to try it. I should have paid more attention to the bad reviews on Yelp. It's not that anything was bad, per se, but the food was really not worth the hour wait and the rushed dining experience. We got the side salad, Texas sausage, pulled pork, sliced brisket, and a selection of sides (fries, mac and cheese, brisket chili, and corn bread). I have to say that the side salad was both huge and delicious. I also liked the Texas sausage and the mac and cheese and corn bread. But neither of the other two main dishes had much flavor and I've definitely had better elsewhere. I also thought it was crazy that the restaurant was out of St. Louis ribs by 8:00 p.m. on a Saturday. I dd think the staff was great, but that's not enough for me to come back.
