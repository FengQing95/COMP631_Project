Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////the evening started off a bit rocky. we made a resi for 6 ppl about 3 weeks ago. when we arrived right on time, we were told to please wait at the bar and they'll all us when our table is ready. so we did. and we waited. we finally got seated about 25 minutes past our reservation time and were all a little on edge. we tried to brush it off. also adding to our frustration, we got seated outside in the semi tented area. normally I'd be really happy about that....but it is fall now and it was 60 degrees! I don't think a restaurant should seat you outside unless they've asked if you're ok with it. especially when we had a reservation and it was clearly pretty darn cold. I swear I'm getting to the good stuff. after all this is a 4 star review.
