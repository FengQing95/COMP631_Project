Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is a great place for tapas and Spanish ambiance. Cafe Ba Ba Reeba offers delicious American-style Spanish food. I finally got a chance to try this place out and enjoyed every bit of it. The Baked Goat Cheese, assortment of Spanish sausages, Spicy Potatoes, White Sangria, and great company made for a very enjoyable evening. Highly recommended. (Reservations suggested)
