Smoque BBQ////Been trying to get here for a while and gladly finally made it the week after Christmas. These guys serve some powerful good hog and I lived in the south so I know my Q.  Will try the brisket next time but I judge my q joints on pig.  Nice bark on the ribs; tried the St Louis style.  Tried my daughter's pulled pork and it was also great. Sides are another key measure of a Q joint: great slaw, corn bread top notch with kernels of corn, mac and cheese nice crust on top and house cut fries also real good.  Wish they had a sweeter option on the sauce.  That said, these ribs were good enough to eat without sauce.  Will be back on my next visit.
