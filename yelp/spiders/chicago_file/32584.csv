Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I took my sister here last night for her bday...i wanted to write a review both because we loved it so much and because we ate a bit differently from everyone else who dines here.  My sister and i are not big steak eaters so when we go to these kinds of places(mastros) we concentrate on the appetizers and the sides.  Here is what we got...for apps we had the salmon tartare....diced up salmon on lavash crackers...light and delicious. We also had the shrimp de jonghe...6 decent sized shrimp in this buttery sauce....amazing.  We had trouble deciding on salads but ended up with the whitefish caeser...a bit heavy...perfect to split and very smokey    We wanted the crab stuffed avocado but thought we would see if we were still hungry . We never got it as we were stuffed. Oh well...next time. We got the fries....same as au cheval and gilt bat if you have ever been to either place. Yum. We also had the corn which was fantastic. My sister enjoyed eating it in the salad. The creamed spinach was heavy on the blue cheese and a diaappointment. When they saw we didnt like it, they took it off the bill. We didnt have room for dessert.  The tab was really reasonable. Obviously we didnt have entrees but there was so much food. The bread and butter to start was also phenomenal!!
