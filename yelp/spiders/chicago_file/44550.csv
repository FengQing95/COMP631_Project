Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////BBR (which sounds like PBR but is so much classier it hurts) is freaking amazing. The atmosphere can be a little crowded and cheesy, but it's very colorful and a fun place to go with groups. I've always thought the service here was above-average. Waiters know how to be friendly and helpful but not over-the-top stalkers. But onto THE FOOD...
