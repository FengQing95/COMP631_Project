Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Trendy place, but worth the wait for reservations.  First time there and had a great meal and fantastic service.   Carved ice cubes for drinks and fresh fruit used for mixers.  Great vodka gimlets as well.  Four of us split about half the menu and had one of the best meals in the city.  2 pounds of lobsters that was already cracked and easy to get to the meat.  Beef stroganoff with homemade noodles was one of the best items on the menu.  Definitely come back again.
