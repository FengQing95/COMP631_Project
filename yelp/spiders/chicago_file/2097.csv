Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Came here just yesterday while on my trip to my boyfriend's sister's graduation! I ordered the Wildberry Bliss Pancake- it was served with fruit on the side (strawberries, blackberries, blueberries) and drizzled with several liquid fruity toppings- and also some sort of cream. Absolutely loved it! Tried what my family ordered as well and everything was perfect! Definitely have to come back to try the tiramisu pancakes & the toffee nut latte!
