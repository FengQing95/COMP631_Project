Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Old school steakhouse for sure. The place is tiny and unassuming from the Outside. Once inside it is dark and dimly lit and frankly somewhat dated.  The service was exceptional and our waiter, Klaus (sp),  was superb. The food was good but not wrote home to mom good.  The double bone in pork chop had good flavor but, as is the case with pork sometimes, was quite tough. My wife's filet was good as well and, although we couldn't be certain due to the lack of lighting, suspected it was cooked beyond mid rare which we ordered.  Oysters on par and shrimp as well.  All in all a good experience but not to the point where I can agree with calling it one of Chicago's best.
