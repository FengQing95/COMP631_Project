Little Goat Diner////Swung by on a Thursday for brunch - definitely recommend booking a reservation in OpenTable ahead of time. Ordered the crab dip to start and really enjoyed it, better crackers or tortilla chips would have helped to elevate it; the Ritz crackers kind of melted in with the dip and more texture would have really made a difference.
