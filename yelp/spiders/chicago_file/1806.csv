Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////One of the best breakfasts in Chicago. Be prepared to wait 30 to 60 minutes anytime of the year. Based on the name you would guess they have good pancakes, they do! They also have a great selection of other breakfast items. The servers are always attentive, reasonably priced, and good food!
