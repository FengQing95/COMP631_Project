Smoque BBQ////I love this place. It is always so clean and nice looking. Besides the aesthetics the food is amazing! I always order too much food because it's hard to choose between everything. My go to is the sausage or be sliced brisket sandwich. The sandwiches are a great option because you get sooo much meat
