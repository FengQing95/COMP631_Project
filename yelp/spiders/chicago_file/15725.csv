Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I think Lou's is great deep dish pizza, but I've kind of grown sick of it. Just one piece is so filling, and the tomato-cheese style isn't that good to me anymore. The butter crust is excellent, though. I just prefer a bit more actual tomato sauce, and this is more about the cheese. However, the thin crust is good too. They have a great Lou's salad too- the dressing is awesome!
