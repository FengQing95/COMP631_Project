Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////for chicago deep dish pizza glory, i think it comes down to two places: pequods and lou's. any time i eat at one place, i switch my vote to that place.  they are both great places for deep dish. but i since i recently had lou's, i will go with lou's for now.  it may be off putting for some, but i love the disc of sausage, so i cant get a piece of sausage in every bite. also, i think the ratio of dough to sauce to toppings is more balanced than pequods. i dont think pequods is as doughy as giordanos but it is a bit on the doughy side.
