Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For three ravenous fellas, we ordered a large Deep Dish Lou - Cheddar * Mushroom * Sliced Tomato * Spinach Mix * Just Right * Cut. This would normally be around $25, but I added pepperoni and Italian sausage on separate halves. This shot up the price to about $38. We also ordered their combination platter (~$12) - cheese sticks, cheese balls (I think), calamari, etc. All this became about 4 full meals for all of us. The pizza was generously topped with the above ingredients that I never felt I missed anything, and actually never needed more. While the original ingredients were wonderfully cooked, I'm glad I was able to add the meats to the pizza. As you may tell, the original ingredients don't necessarily provide a solid salt/seasoned taste, so the meat (aside from the additional protein) was greatly appreciated. I've realized with many pizza locales that appetizers don't quite make the cut, but Lou's combination platter added a nice balance to the entire meal and of course reduced the amount of meals we would get for the rest of our road trip.
