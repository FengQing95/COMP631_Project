Smoque BBQ////I took off a star for the person seating and the person at the register.  We got seated under the menu butted up against the wall where everyone would be staring at us to read the menu in a semi empty restaurant, there were better tables for us.  Plus the counter person did not engage enough to explain anything, ask any questions or inform that there are default sauces and if you want spicy you can ask.   Also I wish they did not have so much single use plastic in there.   The sauces are in plastic containers, plastic straws are still being used, plastic lids too, perhaps for the dining in they can put sauce in paper cups and get paper and wax straws...then I bump to five stars.   The person who gave us the stinky table did ask us if we were enjoying our meal and I did say Yes, except the table!  He apologized..next time we just speak up. I didn't speak up this time as I was taking in the menu, surroundings and getting my bearings.
