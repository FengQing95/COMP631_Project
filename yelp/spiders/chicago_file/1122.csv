Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////So what you're paying for with this Wildberry is the location.  Outside of Corner Bakery, South Water Kitchen and the Bongo Room, there's not really that many under $20 "brunch" places in the Loop on the weekend.  (And all of those have the same quality, if not worse, food than Wildberry does.)  The food you can probably get at any other diner in America, but I agree that the coffee is pretty good.
