Little Goat Diner////This was a random pick of places while visiting Chicago.  Yelp sort FTW.  We went for brunch, lots of good stuff to pick from.  The service was good, friendly, quick.  I ordered the Bullseye French Toast, Husband ordered the Apple pancakes and hash browns.  This was enough food for 4!!  So filling, and a great start to a busy day of walking in the cold!  The food was tasty!  When we visit Chicago again, we will stop back in here, maybe try dinner out!
