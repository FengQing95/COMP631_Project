Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////True Chicago style pizza. Deep dish pizza. Get the one with the butter crust, onions, spinach and mushrooms. Great baseball memorabilia. Busy at lunch time. They have indoor and outdoor seating. The pizza is so filling! We had the small enough for two people! And we were both full. Had the coffee, which is good too. I like the exposed brick and wood floors. A NYC loft type feeling. Go early!!
