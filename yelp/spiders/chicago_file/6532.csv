The Purple Pig////We went to the Purple Pig to celebrate our anniversary. This restaurant has been on our "to try" list for awhile. We were running a few minutes late because traffic on State Street was the worst I have ever seen. Luckily, I called the restaurant when I knew we weren't going to make it and let them know. They were very nice and said that it would be ok. We arrived to dinner about 20 minutes late and they sat us right away! They were very accommodating. Our waiter greeted us and he was fantastic as well. He was so knowledgeable about the menu and what to get. He told us we were getting a lot of food... but we knew that. We wanted to take some home. First, we ordered our drinks, I got the Kentucky Mule and the Prickely Punch. Both were very good, tasty and delicious. For our first dish, we ordered the Pork Liver and Bacon Pate. I have to say that is was one of my favorite things we ordered. The bread was toasted perfectly and the liver was super flavorful. You may be put off by the fact it is liver, but the texture and flavor were awesome. Next, we ordered the crispy pig ear. It was actually just glorified pork rinds. They were super salty and didn't taste great. Even if you break the egg on top perfectly, it doesn't cover the entire thing. While this was the most popular and recommended item, it was my least favorite. Then, we ordered the ricotta gnocchi. It was amazing! The texture was soft and pillowy. The sauce was a burst of flavor that just makes you feel warm and happy. The Milk braised Berkshire shoulder followed. It was very salty, but overall tasted good. The meat was cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes were rich and creamy. Finally, we ordered the half duck with orange and ginger glaze. This dish was HUGE. We saved half since it was so big. Keep that in mind if you make this one of your choices.... And you should. It was very good. The glaze was citrusy and delicious. The skin was crispy and flavorful. The duck meat was tender falling easily off the bone. I would definitely choose this as an optionÂ
