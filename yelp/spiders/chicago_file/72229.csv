Little Goat Diner////This was my first time at the Little Goat, and I was not disappointed. I had made a reservation for 645 pm on a Sunday night but I wanted to bump it up to accommodate plans for later in the night. I was able to easily change the time for that Sunday night. The restaurant is nicely decorated with a mix of clean lines and retro wallpaper prints. We started the night (of gluttony) with a beer, followed by an order of the crab dip between myself and my boyfriend. I decided on the Grilled cheese with pork for dinner, while the other half ordered the pork belly pancake. We then decided we needed to try the goat chili cheese fries as well. As a last minute decision, the man friend decided we ALSO needed to try to tempura mashed potatoes. Good thing he ordered them as the waiter walked away as I would have nixed that idea.
