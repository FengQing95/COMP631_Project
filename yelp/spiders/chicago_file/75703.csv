Little Goat Diner////Little Goat diner has some of the most innovative comfort food in the city. With a diner vibe, this place will wow you with intricate flavors from around the world. My husband loved the bulls eye toast. Even if you go healthy - like the chickpea salad- I was amazed by how the flavors meshed together into an experience beyond anything I've ever had in a salad. Their pastries are also delicious. My personal favorite is the rosemary white chocolate scone. This place gets extremely crowded so be prepared to wait or make a reservation very far in advance.
