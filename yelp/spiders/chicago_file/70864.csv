Little Goat Diner////then the fries have some weird smoky seasoning that just didn't sit well on my taste buds. it kinda ruined that lovely salty potato-y taste of fries. it was just like eating bad tasting smoke. idk, maybe i am a hater, but this place was too expensive for its mehh food experience
