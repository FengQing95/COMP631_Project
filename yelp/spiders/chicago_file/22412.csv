Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The only part that could be improved is the pre-seating service. When we first came in the host seemed completely lost and just stared at us for a few min. Then once he put our name down he told us to go pre-order the pizza. That went smoothly but when we were called to sit down, the same confused host started walking towards the back (we followed him), then he turned out and got menus, handed them to use and told us to go upstairs and someone else will seat it. I'm not sure why we had to go back and forth and why it was so confusing for an employee who probably seats many people a day to tell us right off the bat on where to go. Once we got upstairs we were quickly seated and from there the service was fine.
