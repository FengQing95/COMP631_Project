Art Institute of Chicago////Typing this outside the museum. Layout is all over the place. They charge you $1 for checking in a backpack because it's not allowed. Majority of staff are rude and intimidating. There's even one staff who followed us as if we're going to loot a dismembered piece of Greek statue. Seeing plenty of other museums, I would gladly endure the LA smog and traffic to visit again the Getty Museum. With the overpriced parking fees in Chicago (coming from a Californian), it's not worth coming back. Disappointing.
