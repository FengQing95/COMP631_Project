Little Goat Diner////The problem with the service, however, was two fold- First off, and this is a major pet peeve, you shouldn't need to be desperately trying to lock eyes with someone to refill drinks after everyone at your table has sat there for ten minutes with empty glasses. We rarely saw our waitress, to the point of it being awkward. When the food came out, it absolutely drizzled out from the kitchen, again making it pretty weird as everyone we were with politely waited as everyone finally got their food.
