Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////        The service was pretty good. The only concern is that our drinks took 10-15 minutes to come. I do want to point out that the pizza takes 30-35 mins to cook, but they say it in advance, so that pleased me. Overall, this restaurant is beyond amazing. I'm definitely coming here next time I stay in Chicago!
