Little Goat Diner////I love how many sweet and savory options they have- I ended up getting the Bull's Eye French Toast for myself and it was even better than I thought. There is a sunny side egg in the French Toast. The fried chicken was flavorful and crispy which added a nice contrast in texture and there was a sweet and light syrup on top that really pulled the whole dish together.
