Little Goat Diner////Took us to a booth for two, but directly across from us were larger booths that could seat 4, but each one had only two patrons, so as we are not petite gals and would have appreciated being accommodated, I asked for the larger booth.  Oh no, the gal says, we are setting this booth for 4 people who were waiting.  Ok, that's fine, certainly could understand that.....but within the next minute, they seated two young gals there.  We weren't trendy enough for their clientele?..Come on!  I was appalled at that point!
