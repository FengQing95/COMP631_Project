Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza was really good - the crust was crunchy, the tomato sauce was good, cheese was melted, the usual. Everything you want in a pizza! The only qualm I had was I wish it was a little more hot when it arrived to our table. Maybe it was just our pizza, but the cheese was pretty solidified after like five minutes which was kind of annoying.
