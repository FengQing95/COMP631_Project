Little Goat Diner////I was super excited to come here for brunch last Sunday. The menu was a nice variety with creative items. I settled on the biscuits and gravy and home fries, while my friend got the Japanese pancake with pork belly. I was a bigger fan of her dish than mine, but loved my "little goat latte" which was made with goats milk. Service was good, but unfortunately our waitress disappeared at the end and we spent nearly 2 hours until we were able to cash out.
