Art Institute of Chicago////Pros: Beautiful collection of amazing masterpieces. It is a MUST while in Chicago. Check the schedule, it closes at 5pm most days, I went on Thursday when it closed at 8pm. I was there from noon until they kicked me out and I didn't see all the exhibits, so make plans to be there all day or go at least two days if they close early. I highly recommend paying the extra $7 for the self guided tour, it enhances the experience and allows you to further immerse yourself in the art.
