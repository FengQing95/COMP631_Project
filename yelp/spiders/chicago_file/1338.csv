Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This place came in handy when I was wanting breakfast on Thanksgiving. They were closing early like at 12pm and the place was bursting with people. I got my food within a reasonable amount of time and at a great price for the area. I got blueberry pancakes and eggs to go. I feel Â sorry for the people who were waiting on a table. At one point I think they were turning away people. The staff was friendly and attentive.
