Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////While Visiting Chicago a group of us stopped here last night to have dinner and enjoy some tapas and drinks. Superb! Asides from the amazing atmosphere and wonderful service, We had the seafood paella, the seared octopus, batatas bravas , calamari and pitchers of sangria all night. Wow! Everything was amazing! Highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves Tapas! Five star review for sure
