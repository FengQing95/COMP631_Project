Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The hostess came and got us when it was time for our reservation, the restaurant was slowly starting to fill up. Our server came up right away to make sure we were good on drinks. She was FANTASTIC! Funny, professional, and attentive without hovering. We gave her our order for appetizers and our meals. Sourdough bread and butter arrived first to hold us over until our food started to arrive, the bread was soft, warm, incredible. We started our meal with east coast oysters (delicious,) then had the baked goat cheese appetizer (see photo). It was amazing! Then we got our entrees. The pacing between each course was perfect. Our steak (we both got dry aged ribeye,) was the definition of perfection. An awesome charred crust on the outside, cooked exactly to our liking on the inside. We shared a side of truffle macaroni and cheese. The portion was perfect for two people, but if there are more than two of you, I would get an additional side. I've been to many upscale steakhouses, and I've found the side dishes to often be more of an afterthought (good, but nothing to write home about). This was not the case with the macaroni and cheese here. It was absolutely the best I have ever had! The cheese sauce was rich, and creamy. When the pasta was gone, I found myself scooping up leftover cheese sauce and just eating it with my spoon.
