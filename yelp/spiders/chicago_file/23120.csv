Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The service was great, though you should expect it to take at least 30 minutes for your food to come out (since they put it in the oven and ensure that the crust comes out very nicely).  Also be aware that this restaurant can be PACKED.  We fortunately visited at around 6:30pm on a Tuesday night, so it wasn't too terrible yet.  About half an hour into our dinner, we noticed large groups being turned away because they didn't have reservations and there really wasn't any space.  This restaurant is quite big, space-wise, so that just tells you how popular this place is!  This place is totally worth any wait, in my opinion.
