Smoque BBQ////This is a very good BBQ place.  I've been to Memphis and this would do some damage there.  Not my #1 place , but I think I'm secure to say this is my second favorite BBQ place.  Get the brisket (I got the sliced).  It's very tasty.  I can't tell you which sauce to taste.  You should try them all.
