Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My wife and I have been to many of the best restaurants in Chicago. This is not one of them, but not because of what you would expect. We came here on  a Friday evening and upon entering, this place looked great.  I love that the hostess greets you immediately upon entering prior to your coming  into the restaurant. When  we were seated, our waitress introduced herself the  walked away and served wine to 3 other tables and appeared to engage them quite often, after about 15 min she asked if we wanted an drinks which I ordered the lilette rose martini which sucked. We waited another 15 min as she continued to rub elbows with other patrons and then asked if we were ready to order but my wife needed a few extra min. Never once did she ask if it was our first time there or explained the menu. After waiting a few extra min, another random waiter who was a enthusiastic and nice introduced himself and asked, did the previous waitress tell you that i would be serving you this evening? We answered no, and he then asked if she even bothered explaining the menu, which she never did.
