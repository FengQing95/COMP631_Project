Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We couldn't leave Chicago without the infamous deep dish pizza....Now being a New Yorker I still think the thin slice is the traditional pizza. That said got to Lou Malnati's, parking was easy to find and we got a table right away......Unfortunately the table was right below the air conditioner and thus making it feel like a fridge. I went back to the hostess and requested we swap and that's when the attitude kicked in as I provided more work on her plate. We found another table and just needed a two top for attachment and she made some really nasty facial expressions. That said we finally got our 6 top and began to order. We were hungry so ordered the wings which were great + the spinach loaf + calamari which were outstanding. As for pizza the little one got the personal cheese and we got the medium veg pizza + extra cheese. Man when this came to the table we were excited and couldn't recall the last time we ate pizza with a fork and knife. The wait is long so be prepared as it took roughly 30-40 mins. The pizza was stuffed with topping, weighed about 5 lbs a slice and tasted very good. One slice is more then enough thus we had left overs. Wish I could have tried some competitors while in Chicago but overall your in good hands at this place just be careful of the hostess.......:boo!
