Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Not only did we find one, but two hairs in our cheese plate. I have never been so disguisted. We told the waiter, who returned with a fresh cheese plate. The manager also came over and apologized, and gave us a discount on the bill, but overall we were dissapointed with both the service and the quality of this place.
