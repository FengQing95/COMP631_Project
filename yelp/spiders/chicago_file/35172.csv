Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This was our first visit here.  The service was excellent and the wait staff very attentive.  The two sides we ordered were excellent! The truffle Mac and cheese was exceptionally creamy and we ordered the broccoli to have a vegetable with dinner.  I expected the run of the mill steamed broccoli but it was honestly the highlight of the meal. My husband and I shared the 22 oz ribeye which was very good.  Honestly I would have given Bavette's 5 stars except that they are known first and foremost as a steak house and I honestly can't say it's the best steak we've had.  It had a bit too much gristle for our liking.  But if you dine there, you must save room for dessert and order the chocolate cream pie.  It was outstanding!!
