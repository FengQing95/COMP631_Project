Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////hm. chicago deep dish was not what i expected. i thought it would be sorta like "mountain pie" from beau jo's in colorado, but the crust was thin and it was wayyy more cheese than anything else... like an overwhelming, nauseating amount. can't complain about the value though because their pizzas are pretty cheap, but i much prefer ny style (grimaldi's ftw)!
