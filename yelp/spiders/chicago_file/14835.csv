Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Deep dish....the road to Lou Malnati's was a long one....We walked for blocks, almost stopping at Uno's...Our bellies were growling, our feet were tired but we prevailed. A few blocks further and there it was. We totally lucked out, no wait and we were seated right away. Water, please....Add a Goose Island 312 beer with that.
