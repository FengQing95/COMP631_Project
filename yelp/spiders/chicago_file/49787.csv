Smoque BBQ////Having previously been to Smoque, I decided it was a good choice for my niece.  As a 9-year old, she is an admitted, "ribs snob" so I figured she would like Smoque.  The minute she opened the door and got a whiff of what was cookin' her eyes got huge and she got a big smile on her face.  She loved the baby back ribs but she didn't care for Smoque's BBQ sauce.  For her, it was too spicy (she doesn't care for anything spicy).  I once again ordered the pulled brisket and it was as delicious as always.  I've never been a fan of their vinegar-based cole slaw or their macaroni and cheese (kinda bland) but LOVE their french fries.  My niece gave the fries 2 thumbs up as well.  I like the no-frills attitude of Smoque but I have to ding them on not having any ice in the ice machine!
