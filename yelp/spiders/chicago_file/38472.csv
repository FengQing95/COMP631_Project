Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great Chicago Steakhouse, staff was attentive and helpful.  I was able to snag the last seat at the bar.  Shrimp cocktail is almost a meal for one.  Great wine list as would be expected.  Ribeye was huge, cooked to perfection and delicious.   After dinner cocktail perfectly concocted to finish made for a great night.  I will definitely be going back.
