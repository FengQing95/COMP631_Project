Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Small plate places have a special place in my culinary heart.  Especially when the atmosphere and service are cranked to 11 like they are here.  Ordered multiple items throughout the evening and none of them disappointed, I hate chicken salad but their chicken curry salad made a believer out of me.
