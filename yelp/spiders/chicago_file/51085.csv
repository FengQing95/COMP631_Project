Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My girlfriend and I came here after having gone to Barcelona, Spain and trying many paellas there. This place was fantastic with so many delicious options and things to try. Recommend the seafood paella (they serve the paellas at all times of the day btw, you just have to ask) and the Patatas Bravas! Will definitely eat here again!
