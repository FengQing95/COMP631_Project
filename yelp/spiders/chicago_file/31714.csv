Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Was excited to get some Chicago pizzas as a gift while social distancing out of town....   What I actually got was a mess.   Sorry, but the topping shouldn't all be on one side.   Both crustless pizzas arrived like that.  The regular crust pizzas arrived in good shape.  Huge let down
