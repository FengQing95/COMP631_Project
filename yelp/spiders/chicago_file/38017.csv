Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////A restaurant that valued their customers would have simply informed us that a table would not become available.  Instead, they monopolized our evening and ruined what could have been a pleasant family reunion.  I do not object to them being busy... it was inconsiderate to not let us know that a table would not be available anywhere close to the time frame they indicated.
