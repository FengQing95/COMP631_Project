Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place is bomb - crab cakes and the steaks are the real standouts here, but cocktails as well as ambiance is fantastic here.  I like ordering a few appetizers and a crab cake, then splitting steaks among your friends (you can ask them to slice them for you in the back).  Sides are great as well.
