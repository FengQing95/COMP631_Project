Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food was okay, there was nothing I really loved- we were served family style so I was able to try quite a bit. The Brussels sprout salad was not one of the better ones I've had. I found the cheese overtly assertive. The goat cheese in tomato sauce was eh, the tomato sauce just tasted like something you'd get from a jar. The vegetables that came with the short rib were inedible, they were not remotely cooked through. The charcuterie plate and garlic shrimp were both good, not items that necessarily require a significant amount of finesse.
