Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////There are many great reasons on their menu, why they are jammed packed every weekend of the year. I love the atmosphere as well as the food and drinks. Its worth coming here for the hearty Spanish style bread alone. Crusty dense and soft inside transport me back to the Iberian peninsula. I could live on this bread. This place and Eatly are neck and neck for best bread in the city. Their imported wood burning oven from Spain in the hands of the cooks here is priceless. Therefore, don't just have the tapas, enjoy some of the perfectly cooked items out of the oven. You won't regret it (for example the tender fall off the bone lamb). Â Hands down this place is very worth the splurge!
