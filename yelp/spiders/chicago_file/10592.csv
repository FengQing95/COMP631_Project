Art Institute of Chicago////If you don't live in Chicago or Illinois expect to pay a HIGH entrance fee of $23 (Dec 2014).  These places are out of control on entry fees.  If you are local or a state resident, you will need to show your drivers license to prove it, you do get a discount.   Due to the high cost of entry, I would plan to stay a while once you are here.  Come early and wear walking shoes.
