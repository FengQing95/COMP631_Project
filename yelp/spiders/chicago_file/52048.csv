Smoque BBQ////My fiance and I had Smoque cater our recent wedding.  The food was amazing; our guests raved about it.  The catering manager, Peggy, is extremely professional and very thorough.  She put forth a lot of effort to ensure that our food service would run smoothly.  The catering staff who worked the day of our event were excellent, as well.  I highly recommend Smoque catering!
