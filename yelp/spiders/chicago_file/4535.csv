The Purple Pig////They don't take reservations or wait lists.  I understand that about a place - not that I love it b/c it's then hard to get in.  Last night - a little before 5 pm, we were five blocks from the Pig and called to ask how long a wait would be for two people.  If it was too long, we were going to veer directions and walk to another dinner place.
