Little Goat Diner////Service was good,  food was tasty.  Coffee was weak and I like strong coffee.  I had the omelette of the day (cream crab) and it was delicious.  The pickled sides really made the dish stand out above other places.  I arrived about 8:30 on Sunday morning and was seated right away.
