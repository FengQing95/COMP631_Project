Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////To be fair right off the bat, I think I may have ordered wrong...don't you just hate that! I had the short rib stroganoff. This was very tasty, but way too heavy with the cream. Yes, I know it was a stroganoff, but the noodles were almost congealed with the creamy sauce. I thought the dish was then off balance. The short rib was delicious, albeit not yet rendered completely with bits of fat still hanging off. Cook short rib right and that fat melts away into the meet adding to the delicious flavor! My friend had the roast chicken and that was truly delicious! Super moist and flavorful...I had some food envy on that one. The roasted broccoli had good flavor but was over cooked and mushy. I barely had to use my fork to cut into it. If the char from roasting it had not been there which added a nice flavor, I would not had eaten it. I hate that mushy texture. The wine was delicious, the atmosphere fun and chill, and I would love to go back and try a good steak, which was my first inclination!! Always go with your "gut" literally!
