Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It was the first break in an insane heatwave so I got all dolled up and sure was glad I did. The place is gorgeous and the jazz playing at just the right level, divine. From the moment we entered we felt warm and welcomed. Noticing the sexy corner table, we inquired and were rewarded with it. With my guy and the coldest tastiest blue cheese stuffed olive martini, I was in heaven. Then came the house-made sourdough. SHUT THE FRONT DOOR! Â I still dream about that bread. They better be baking bread in Las Vegas, that's all I'm saying. And of course with the steak (bone in ribeye for him; petit filet w Gorgonzola for me), it just keeps getting better. Creamed spinach and insane potatoes rounded out the feast. Like I said, we still dream about that meal.
