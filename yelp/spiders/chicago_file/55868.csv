Smoque BBQ////Went for lunch on our Company Outing. I had the Half Pulled Pork Sandwich w/ slaw and fries, and it was AWESOME! The sandwich was huge (i'm afraid to see what a whole one looks like), the fries were crisp, and for someone who dosen't even eat coleslaw, that container was empty. The best part? BYOB, so I was able to enjoy my Hard Apple Cider with my sandwich.
