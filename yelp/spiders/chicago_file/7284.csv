Art Institute of Chicago////I went here for my second visit last Wednesday and I loved it just as much this time as last time if not more. I came to see the Chinese art collection as well as to check out some Andy Warhol, the Ferris Bueller painting, Gaugain, and Picasso paintings. I also checked out the Native American art. I was very impressed by the beauty of all of the things I saw at the Art Institute. So exquisite, refines, and classy. The whole museum is very well kept and orderly. Everyone who comes there is very respectful. If I lived in Chicago I think I might pay to be a member so I can go every weekend just to stare longingly at the landscape paintings that fill this museum. An absolute must-see in Chicago!
