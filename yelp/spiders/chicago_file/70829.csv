Little Goat Diner////This place is near and dear to my heart. We haven't dined here but we had our wedding party on their rooftop with food served from both Little Goat and Girl and the Goat menus. Service was fantastic and every item served exceeded our expectations. The crew went above and beyond to make sure all guests had a great time. The bartender even whipped up a cocktail to reflect the heritage of the wedding couple (Indian and Italian) which turned out to be the biggest hit of all drinks ordered at the party. All in all, we are very glad we picked this place for our wedding party!
