Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Me and wife came to spend the weekend in the city and a friend recommended this place and we had to try it and I'm thankful we did. Oh boy oh boy was it great we had the Malnatis clasic and it was really good and the prep time was not that bad but the wait time to get seated can take a while so plan ahead.
