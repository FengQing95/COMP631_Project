Little Goat Diner////Easily some of the best food I've had in a long time, very cute retro diner feel, and phenomenal service! That being said THIS IS NOT A TRADITIONAL AMERICAN DINER! If you come here looking for normal cuisine, it's not going to make you happy, but if you desire an adventure of sorts this place will have you coming back over and over again!
