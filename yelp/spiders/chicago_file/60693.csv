Smoque BBQ////Following other Yelpers' advice, I avoided ordering the coleslaw, though the guys with me liked it. I may try it next time. I have to say, the sweet and smoky-tasting baked beans are awesome. Likewise, same goes for the fresh-cut, skin-on potato fries that are the best on this side of Gene & Jude's. The corn bread was decent but not mind-blowing.
