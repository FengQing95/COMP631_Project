The Purple Pig////I wouldn't waste your time or money at this restaurant. I honestly don't understand how it has this many good reviews. My family ordered 3-4 of the "most popular dishes" (lamb shank, Gyro, Duck, Crispy Pig Ear) suggested by the waiter who came to our table once for less than 10 second. Never picked up our bill. Maybe the duck was good. Service was terrible and the food was mediocre at best.
