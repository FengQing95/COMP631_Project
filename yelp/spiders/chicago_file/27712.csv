Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Traveling to Chicago for business and this was a recommended stop. I am a pizza lover and usually avoid chain pizza places. Lou Malanati"s Pizza is the exception it is a small town pizza shop turned empire by their great quality and execution. Our dinner was great from the salad and Calamari to our pizza, even the leftover pizza was a great lunch the next day. The prices aren't cheap but the Quality is definitely worth every penny. Can't wait to go back to Chicago for this pizza!!!
