Smoque BBQ////Sooooo Good! I used to think that BBQ was eaten only during the 4th of Juiy  outside on the grass before I realized the are great BBQ restaurants hidden in the city!!  My sister wanted to try Smoque, she had heard it was good so we went for dinner.  You order before you are seated, the staff is really helpful and nice, never mind this was our first time and we were asking the cashier a million questions and there was a long line behind us, she was really patient.  We ordered the combo rib platter, pulled pork sandwich and texas sausage.  Ribs were juicy, tender and falling off the bone, the St Louis Style had a nice flavor to it, they offer BBQ sauce on the side , slightly sweet and not too vinigar-y. Don't miss the texas sausage, lots of flavor and well worth it, the sides are good too! Mac and Cheese, and beans were the favorites, all dinners come with slaw.  Only dessert  offered is peach cobbler which has large chunks of peaches with a crumble/granola top served warm!
