Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The tapas at Cafe Ba-ba-reeba are delicious!! Some of the tapas are pretty typical that I have had at other restaurants such as the bacon wrapped dates. (Always a great choice!)  There is a wide selection that I have not tried and was very excited.  It's pretty hard to decide on a favorite, but if you like seafood I suggest trying the Citrus-Cured Salmon, Cucumber, Crema & Toast. My mouth is salivating as I re-imagine this dish. Although I love the food, the service was just okay.  The restaurant is on the louder side & our server spoke so slowly and quietly that we couldn't hear her at all.  As always I suggest tapas restaurants for groups of people so you can taste a little bit of everything.  I would like to come back to try the paella! Definitely a fan of Cafe Ba-ba-reeba!
