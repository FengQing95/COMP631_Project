The Purple Pig////1. Grilled broccoli - grilled with roasted garlic, drizzled with anchovy vinaigrette, topped with breadcrumbs. The vegetable is grilled to perfection with the broccoli crowns being soft and the stalks soft and crunchy. The vinaigrette may have been a bit too much and made the dish more salty. Maybe a little less and it would've been better.
