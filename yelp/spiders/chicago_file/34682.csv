Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Came here in late December and thought things were still pretty good...filet tasted a little too charred for my liking... almost Pittsburgh style.  I'm not one to send food back so I still ate it, just worth noting. We had creamed spinach and oysters and a few other things that I can't quite remember, a feast nonetheless.  My husband ordered the Jameson and pickle juice back and enjoyed.  Looking forward to our next visit.
