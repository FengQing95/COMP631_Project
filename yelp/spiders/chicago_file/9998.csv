Art Institute of Chicago////Hands down, my favorite art museum I've ever been to. This beats out the Getty LA. If Impressionism is up your alley, you will fall in love with this place. Remember all the art pieces that you've studied in your art classes? They've got them! Seurat, Van Gogh, Monet, and my favorite artist, Georgia O'Keefe. This is a must see venue if your ever exploring Chicago. I would recommend that you do pay for the $1 per item to check in because you end up spending 3+ hours at this museum and it would be torturous to have to lug your hefty jacket around the whole time (if you're visiting during the winter). Admission is about $20 per person. I would definitely come back here if I visited Chicago again!
