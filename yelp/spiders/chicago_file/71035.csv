Little Goat Diner////I can't think of a single thing Little Goat does poorly. They are incredibly inventive with their menu - fusing authentic Asian flavours in 'This Little Piggie went to China' and unafraid to experiment via strawberries on their take of chicken and waffles (Bullseye). If you find yourself perplexed by a menu item, just go ahead and try it. The execution will blow you away every time. And if you're feeling really hungry, the Goat Almighty burger is literally bigger than my face. I got a few nods for downing that beast.
