Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Somewhere along the way, the spicy potatoes showed up. YUM! They were moist, but toasted on the outside with a zingy outer coating. And I never really got into what the sauce/moosh was that came with it, but you put the two together and you really lose any sense of caring about anything, because they are that amazing together. Get the spicy potatoes!!!!!
