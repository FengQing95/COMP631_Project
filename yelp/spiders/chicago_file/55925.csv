Smoque BBQ////i feel bad giving this place 3 stars, but i think i'm just a bbq snob. after having bbq in the meccas of austin, lockhart, and kansas city, this place does not come close to ranking. however, i will give credit where it's due! Â the brisket is delicious, probably one of the most tender i've ever had. however, what lacked is the genuine smoky flavor and seasoned goodness compared to other briskets. the ribs were also very good, and i'm quite picky about ribs. Get the St. Louis style ribs for sure - way more flavor than the baby back. the pulled pork was just okay. Me and my husband both enjoyed the sausage too.
