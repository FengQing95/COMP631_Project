Little Goat Diner////The space is bright and fun.  So much going on with the coffee bar, bar, bakery, diner - I'm sort of in love with the whole thing.  And, Sean (server) and James (manager) were both so gracious when I embarrassingly had to send my meal back.  Their customer service was first rate -- despite a line out the door, they recognize the importance of keeping each customer happy.
