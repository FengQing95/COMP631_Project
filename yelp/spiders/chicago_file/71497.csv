Little Goat Diner////This restaurant seems to have become more commercialized and not as delicious as it used to be. Some of my favorite dishes are no longer on the menu such as the breakfast spaghetti and clams and the passionfruit pie and they no longer serve stumptown coffee which is disappointing loved being able to get that great Brooklyn coffee in Chicago. Options seem to be more limited - as usual when things start to commercialize and franchise they loose that spark. Still a very nice place but don't know if I will continue bringing out of town visitors there for brunch anymore.
