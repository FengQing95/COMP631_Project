Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So we arrived with reservations and still had to wait another 30 minutes which was crazy. We waited outside because the place was packed. When we got inside and upstairs the wait staff was wonderful but to be honest the food was mediocre. The ranch dressing tasted homemade which was nice but the pasta and sauce had no flavor at all. The deep dish pizza was doughy and mostly sauce. I was excited to try deep dish but not after eating here.
