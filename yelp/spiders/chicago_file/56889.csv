Smoque BBQ////The only reason I took off a star is that we got there at 5:30pm and it took over an hour to get our food.  We knew this going in, and were not surprised or miffed by the wait, but if the weather had been crappy or if we had come later and had to wait longer, this wouldn't have been as good of an experience.  Next time we will call ahead and do carry out.  Yum!
