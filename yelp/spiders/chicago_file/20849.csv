Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is a tourist pizza stop for peeps that are "non-residents" to Chicago. I have had my fair share of trying mom n pop spots and prefer them over LM. Their pizza is good but I've had better. The service was great but I would probably suggest checking out other pizza joints in Chicago.
