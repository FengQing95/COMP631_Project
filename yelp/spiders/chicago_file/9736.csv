Art Institute of Chicago////It was a short trip and didn't have much time to explore all of AIC, but did manage to spend at least 2 hours there. Hit my faves and luckily for me, majority was located in the Impressionism wing. One of which included A Sunday on La Grande Jatte by Seurat. I recommend everyone to check it out! Seeing this amazing piece of art in person was truly astounding. I knew it was large-scale, but just standing in front of it... inspiring!
