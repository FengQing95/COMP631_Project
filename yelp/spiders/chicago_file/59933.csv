Smoque BBQ////The baked beans are my favorite side, mac and cheese is good, peach cobbler is good, cornbread is ok.  I really do  not like the brisket chili at all, it has good flavor but its just not my thing.  Cole slaw is ok.  Fries are good when fresh, but like any fried food they do not transfer well, so no luck with take out.
