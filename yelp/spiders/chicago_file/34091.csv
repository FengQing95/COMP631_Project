Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food at Bavette's is absolutely phenomenal. Per another Yelper's suggestion, we ordered the Peppered Duck & Goat Cheese Terrine hors d'oeuvre. It is amazing, plentiful, and served with house-baked sourdough bread that is to die for. Ask for extra bread and BUTTER. Their butter is also made in-house. It is salted and creamy and oh so good. All of our main dishes were delectable, but also amazing are their side dishes. We tried the creamed spinach. What is in this dish that makes it SO GOOD?! (Actually, don't tell me. It's probably something very high cal that I don't want to consider when enjoying this dish again!) And the buttery mashed potatoes? Also great.
