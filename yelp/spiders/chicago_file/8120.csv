Art Institute of Chicago////They had sections of Contemporary Art, Asian Art, European Art, etc. We really enjoyed the miniature rooms collection. So much to do, again, to get the best for your money you really should wipe your schedule clean and spend atleast half a day here. Bring comfy shoes - my feet ached so bad by the time I was there a few hours, I had to go. This place is absolutely amazing. Your trip will not be complete without a stop here.
