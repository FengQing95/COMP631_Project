Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////So sure, a restaurant wedding isn't for everyone. But this wedding was exactly us. My husband and I cannot wait til our one year anniversary. We're going to dinner at Cafe Babareeba and spending the weekend at the Four Seasons Chicago to re-live our wedding weekend just as it was.
