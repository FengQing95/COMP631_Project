Little Goat Diner////Little Goat is a solid go to place when I'm in the West Loop. It's great for kids. I find the wait is never as long as the hostess tells you it's going to be.  But there will be a wait. Some tables are communal. It's bright. It's lively.  I've always had outstanding service. Food comes out promptly and is always hot. A go to item of mine is the crisp shrimp cocktail. It can be enough for a lunch on its own. The fish tostadas are quite a filling and tasty (the batter doesn't overpower the fish). They are topped with a great slaw.  There's usually a vegetarian soup. Soups are good but not great.  Burgers are a kid fave. I really enjoy their shakes, but wish the serving was bigger.  That's me loving my dessert.
