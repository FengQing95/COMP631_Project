Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////After grabbing said drink, a couple bar stools opened up and we decided to dine there. The bartender was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. We weren't looking to spend a ton that night (which you can easily here) so we got the small filet, meatloaf, elotes, and Brussels.
