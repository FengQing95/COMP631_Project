Little Goat Diner////The food was phenomenal! I had such a difficulty trying to decide on what to order, but ended up going with the porkbelly pancake and was definitely not disappointed! It was a scallion pancake with the porkbelly on top, then covered with a sprout slaw. The pork was super tender and paired greatly with the pancake and slaw! The perfect savory dish! Then I ordered the brussels sprouts as a side-and omygod. I swear the vegetables are always a highlight at an Izard restaurant. They were cooked with The Saute sauce and almonds and were perfectly tender and delicious. My mom ordered the apple-tomato soup and the Los Drowned sandwich; both of which she said were super tasty.
