Smoque BBQ////Food was enjoyed by all. I could not decide so I had the 1/2 and 1/2. Half chopped brisket and half pulled pork. Best of both worlds. No choice on sauce but liked the house sauce so no foul there. The mac and cheese was decent but was too small of portion. Would not get again, only because of size. Cole slaw was tasty enough. Not usually a fan, but ate my sons as well.
