Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is a great tapas place for a group.  The prices are reasonable, the menu is varied and the service is usually pretty speedy.  The sangria pitchers are also a great choice for large groups - there are a few different flavors (I like the classic red the best but my gal pals seem to dig the passion fruit), so it adds to the fun.
