Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We were visiting Chicago and wanted to try this place but it was completely booked, but they're willing to put you on a waitlist if you show up in person. While we waited for a table, multiple staff checked in on us and worked hard to get us a table. After one drink at the bar, we had one! The aged ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and the truffle Mac and Cheese was delicious!! We had the chocolate cream pie for desert and it didn't disappoint. It's a must try if you love chocolate. Overall we had an excellent experience here and would recommend it to anyone.
