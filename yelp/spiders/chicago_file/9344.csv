Art Institute of Chicago////I actually learned to appreciate art by visiting often. For art enthusiasts or frequent visitors, I would HIGHLY suggest you stop by the Museum Book Store and pick up "The Art Institute of Chicago: The Essential Guide" ($19.95), which goes in to detail about the museum's famous pieces. You'll come off as incredibly smart to all your friends!
