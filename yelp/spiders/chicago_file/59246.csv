Smoque BBQ////I've been craving bbq for a while and Smoque was the perfect remedy when I went there this past Saturday. I had a chopped brisket sandwich with a side of mac 'n cheese. The brisket was divine--tender, juicy, and oh-so full of flavor. And it was BIG, which I'm grateful for because that day I felt like a pregnant woman in July, craving a side of beef.
