Little Goat Diner////I went here with friends for our platonic date night. We had reservations and were seated right around that time in a booth. We ordered mac and cheese, hot crab dip, sauteed brussel sprouts, and goat chili cheese fries to share. The hot crab dip was the stand out by far. To. Die. For. ORDER IT!!! The goat chili cheese fries were good not great and the mac and cheese was only okay.
