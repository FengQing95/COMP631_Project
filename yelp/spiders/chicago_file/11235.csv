Art Institute of Chicago////I think it was $25 for admission for out of state guests. I was more into the paintings and the art than the statues. They had a bunch of Picasso and Dali paintings which highlighted them all. They have just great pieces of art and other works in this museum and I'm glad I had the opportunity to see them.
