The Purple Pig////Believe the hype in the other reviews and definitely try the fried pigs ears! So much richness with the slivers of fried pigs ear and kale, but the pickled peppers counter it nicely. We shared the braised pork shoulder, and it was phenomenal! Their cocktail list is fabulous too. I can't recommend it enough.
