The Purple Pig////My nth visit to this place and ofcourse it never disappoints. The news things I tried this time around were broccoli - fantastic, crispy and slightly. And their version of Foie gras, it was pan seared, surrounded by a delicious almond butter layer and nuts. The combination of flavors was superb!
