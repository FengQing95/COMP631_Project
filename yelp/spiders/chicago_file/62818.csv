Smoque BBQ////Definitely the best ribs that I've had so far. Even though the line's kind of long, it's worth the wait. That night, we had Baby Back Ribs, St Louis Ribs, Pulled Pork and Peach Cobbler. The ribs're very tender and flavorful! The Peach Cobbler's amazing, everyone should definitely try one. If you guys like ribs, make sure to stop by this place.
