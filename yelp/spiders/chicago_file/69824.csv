Little Goat Diner//// But what can you say? "You seem nice, but can you please tell management they just F*%#@ed up everything? Maybe they should try a craft shop?". The menu just isn't good. It's not thought through, it's overpriced, there are almost NO vegetarian options, bacon is a cool fad but it doesn't fix bad dishes, too much oil. It's feels like a menu made by someone from cooking school who has never actually worked in a restaurant or cooked for fun at home. TRY YOUR OWN DISHES, little goat. and expect to go for a really long run after that too.
