Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We dined in the Parlour, their intimate basement area. My boyfriend and I thought the ambiance there was perfect -- dark, quiet, intimate, plush seating, surrounded in stone wall, illuminated by lavish lamps and candles, with a nice view of the elegant bar (which was not in service but we just really loved the vibe).
