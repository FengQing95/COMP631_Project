Little Goat Diner////I've been here three times. Each time, I've had a modest wait which is to be expected. One time, my party of 3 was seated at a booth that could hold 8 while a large party that arrived on our heels were told their wait was about 30 mins more -- we asked why we wouldn't be seated at a smaller table, gave them ours.
