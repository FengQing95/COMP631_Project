Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm sure a lot of people may disagree but I prefer the deep dish from Giordano's. When we first moved to Chi-town the people we first friended told us that Lou's is good for its pasta and regular crust pizzas. So for many years I would go to Giordano's for deep dish when the craving strikes (which wasn't often since its such a heavy meal) or when friends came to visit (multiple times a year). Not once did I consider anywhere else for deep dish until we come back to Chicago as a tourist.
