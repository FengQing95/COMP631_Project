Little Goat Diner////Even though Little Goat is known as the sufficient alternative for the Girl and the Goat, I'd say that this fashionable and modern diner can hold its own. I made a reservation through Open Table for a meeting with a friend, and we were seated promptly at a large and very comfortable booth on the perimeter of the room with a window to the outside. My only complaint with that, which is also my only complaint for the experience itself, was that the sun was coming in at the time and blinding us so we had to draw the blinds ourselves - no big deal. The waiters were very attentive and refilled my water each time I guzzled it down. They were also very knowledgable about the menu and answered any questions and accommodated any special food requests that my friend and I had.
