Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Holy deliciousness. Literally everything I put in my mouth was life changing. No words were spoken on this dinner date. All of the oysters were tasty and accompanied by the perfect sauces. Bone marrow and big toasty buttery bread was a total mouthgasm (and I'm having one right now as I'm thinking about it). We got the bone-in steak which was the best steak I've ever had hands down. All of the sides we tried were phenomenal. Brussel sprouts are a must.
