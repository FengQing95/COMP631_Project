Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////(NB: This review is for brunch-only.) The idea of tapas brunch seems, at best, infelicitous. Portions are awkward while choices are starchy, and so one doesn't know how much to order. Our selections arrived incredibly quickly (or while I or my partner were in the restroom), and yet, were lukewarm at best. The potatoes had that classic, leathery cafeteria potato texture (with a great seasoning). The eggs were all perfectly cooked. The coffee was insipid, and the Bloody Mary buffet was amusingly undersupplied.
