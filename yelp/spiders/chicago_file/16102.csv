Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pizza here is an art form, and Lou's measures up.  The pizza was so good and topped with top quality ingredients.  Their sausage was good too.  It was sweet and not oily and gross like I get in LA.  Everything was so good I froze it and brought the leftovers home in my luggage.
