The Purple Pig////The burrata has some proscuitto slices which my sister ended up eating, but I'm sure if you don't eat pork you could get the dish without them. The presentation for this dish is very beautiful, with the balsamic glaze and bits of butternut squash sprinkled in the arugula, and pita chip arch, and it tasted just as amazing as it looked.
