Smoque BBQ////When it comes to me and barbecue, consistency is KEY and Smoque certainly pleases. The lines can be crazy long, but the help orchestrates the situation like culinary maestros and breezes you through the queue ensuring that you'll have a place to sit once your food is up. The brisket is my first love, but the ribs and pulled pork are wonderful as well. You just can't really go wrong, so try a combo plate. The sides (brisket chili, beans, mac and cheese and cornbread) are a perfect accompaniment to the meal. Thanks for showing Chicago how it's done!
