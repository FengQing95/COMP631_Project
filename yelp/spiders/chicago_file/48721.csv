Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My friend and I stopped in for dinner on Halloween night, and the place was energetic but not packed. Good service, nice ambiance. We ordered the roast dates, calamari, goat cheese in tomato sauce, spicy potatoes, and a chicken empanada. Again, all good but not amazing...though now that I think about it, we weren't too creative with our ordering. If I came back, I might branch out a little more and then perhaps I'd be a bit more impressed.
