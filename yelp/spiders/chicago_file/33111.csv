Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Last night we ate there and it was extremely delicious.  The menu definitely focuses on beef and seafood, and they do a really great job with it.  I love when a restaurant doesn't try to be 15 different things (Hub 51 is an example of a restaurant failing at this) and they are focused instead.  The portions are generous, especially the salads.  Our server did help us out and made sure we didn't order too much food.  I shared the endive salad with a couple friends, it was definitely enough for 3 people.  Then I had the Shortrib Stroganoff.  Order it.  It was perfect.  The short rib was cooked to perfection, it just melted in my mouth.  The pasta is fresh.  The mushrooms were full of flavor.  The sherry cream sauce pulled everything together.  This is something I will order again.  My husband ordered the bone in rib eye.  It was huge.  He ate the entire thing.  I tried it and loved it.  He had Roquefort added on top and it made something that was already delicious even more delicious.  There were 5 of us total, and we ordered 3 sides: sweet potato, fully loaded baked potato, and the roast tomatoes.  We did struggle to finish everything.  These potatoes are HUGE.  And so good.  The bacon at Bavettes is thick cut amazingness.  Add that to a potato with cheese and sour cream and you really have something.
