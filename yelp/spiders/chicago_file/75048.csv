Little Goat Diner////I had a great walk getting to this place! its right across from it's sister restaurant and down from au cheval. Man, that place had a huge line forming before it was even open, but no surprise, so did this place! Lucky i was by myself this trip and got seating right at the bar! The service here was great and i was greeted promptly, recommended the little goat coffee drink (their own hand made salted caramel with goats milk latte. SUPER DELISH) and told personal favorites on the menu. I decided to get the shrimp and grits with poached egg and a fresh biscuit on the side. The first bite was amazing! but sadly as i kept eating it, i just felt like something was missing. salt? more pepper maybe? i don't know, but just something was missing. maybe more cheese on the grits, but i just can't give it more than the three stars for this place, especially once the bill came out and i found that the eggs were extra. Now that biscuit was superb. so i'll give em that, definitely come by and grab a baked good and some coffee and you'll be happy. but as for the food my personal opinion is its just okay. Try for yourself!
