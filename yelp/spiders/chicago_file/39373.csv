Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our desserts did not quite match the caliber of the preceding courses.  My lemon meringue pie had the flavor and consistency of a decent key lime pie, its tart custard offset by a laughable skyscraper of sweet white fluff.  Not a home run but surely a base hit.  My Missus enjoyed ice cream with a pot of decadent hot fudge, and we both indulged in French press coffee.
