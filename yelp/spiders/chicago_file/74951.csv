Little Goat Diner////And the food?  Eh.  The most I can say if you like your dishes over-indexed on flavor and ingredients, this should be for you.   (I like Jackson Pollack paintings too--I just don't want to eat one for breakfast.  Nor do I need the top flavor found in hanging trees in your local cab to don my eggs).
