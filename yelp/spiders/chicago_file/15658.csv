Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Its been two weeks since I first had Lou Malnati's and I still cannot stop thinking about it.  Wish I was in Chicago right about now to have a slice of their delicious pizza! I was in town for a girlfriend's birthday and came to this restaurant for an early lunch. The restaurant fills up quickly so get there early to avoid the long lines.  By the time we had finished our meals, there was an hour wait already.  For starters, we had the stuffed spinach bread.The sauce on the side is perfect with he bread.  We ordered a large pizza of the Malnati Chicago classic.  It was split among 4 girls and we still had 2 slices left over.  Request that the pizza be cooked well done.  Our server recommended it cooked that way and I couldn't have agreed more.  The pizza was dripping with so much cheese and sausage.  We also added spinach which added a nice balance to all the flavors coming from the pizza.  Definitely a must try!
