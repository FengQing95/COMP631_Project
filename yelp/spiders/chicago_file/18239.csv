Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered a Lou Malnati's pizza shipped to our door a few years back and were disappointed with it. We have heard so many good things about this place that we figured while In Chicago we would have to try it fresh from the oven. Unfortunately, the pizza wasn't significantly better than what we experienced shipped to our door. The pizza was kind of bland and nobody in our party seemed to really be blown away by it. The salad was made from a premixed bag lettuce which was subpar. The garlic bread and sauce were the highlights of our meal. We really only ordered these because everyone was so hungry and the pizza takes a while to cook. Service here was average.
