Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place is excellent! Geoffrei the Sous chef, is marvelous! Also, please ask for the server, Johnny. There is no better feeling than your sever knowing the menu all the way down to the smallest detail, in addition to having a great personality. The bartender makes hand crafted alcohol deliciousness, his artistry is magnificently beautiful, awaking all of the senses, which is also displayed visually. I love it here, not my 1st time or my last . -Chloe Taylor
