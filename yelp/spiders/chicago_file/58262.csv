Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Absolutely amazing experience! As other reviewers have mentioned, the "Paella Mixta" is a MUST. Other favorites: spicy potatoes, baked goat cheese, grilled pork with chimichurri, and the tortilla espanola. SO GOOD!! We followed our lovely server's suggestion to order 2-3 tapas per person and it was way too much food for us personally, but they were kind about our failure to finish our food and brought boxes. All dishes were excellent reheated the next morning as well.
