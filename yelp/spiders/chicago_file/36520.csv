Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Rather nice wine selection, even good options by the glass. I loved the rose/st.germaine cocktail! Shrimp cocktail was perfectly cooked, beautifully displayed. I love that it came with towels to clean our hands after peeling the shrimp. Brussels sprouts were delectable. I ordered the small filet mignon- medium, and it was overcooked... I was so disappointed! It was brown throughout, just very light pink in the very center, and the crusty bits on the outside were charred to the point of being burnt. It came out somewhere in between medium well and well done. I would have considered sending it back, but we had plans after dinner and were already stretched for time. Also, they don't put salt on the steak when cooking- they just bring out their signature salt mixture on the table and you can add as you'd like (I didn't like).
