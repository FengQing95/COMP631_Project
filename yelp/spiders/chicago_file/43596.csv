Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Alas, my fiance (aka person I go out to eat with most) does not share my unabiding passion for all things tapas. So, its a rare occasion when I get to come here. Maybe thats part of the reason that I like it so much, maybe...but I've never been disappointed by something I've ordered. The basics are great - tortilla espanola, patatas, queso de cabra al horno, etc. And, the specials that I've tried have been good too, including a seared tuna and watermelon soup that were both yum.
