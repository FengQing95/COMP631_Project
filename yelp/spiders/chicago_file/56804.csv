Smoque BBQ////I heard from many people that if you are looking for BBQ in Chicago, this is the place.  I have sort turned into a BBQ snob as I was unfortunately living in Kansas City for a year.  That being said, this place was very good and if I am ever near the Irving Park blue line, I will make the stop.
