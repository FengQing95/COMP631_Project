Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////There aren't very many tapas restaurants where I come from (and it's not in the middle of nowhere or the country). Simply put - tapas are not good in my hometown. I had a bad experience where they just plopped some pre-made stuff onto tiny plates and called that tapas. Upon stepping into this dimly lit place in Lincoln Park called Ba-Ba-Reeba (with a lunch reservation this time, I've finally figured you Chicagoans out!), we were seated right away in a snug but romantic corner near the back.
