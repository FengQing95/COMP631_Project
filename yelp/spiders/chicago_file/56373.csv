Smoque BBQ////Smoque gets 5 stars because not only is everything on their menu delishible but they have "seaters" who find you a table and reassure you that when your food is ready, you will be able to sit. This is huge. It's like Hot Dougs in that respect, which to me shows you care about your customers. My biggest pet peeve is people who sit down to save a seat for their group before the group has ordered their food. So people who have already ordered but don't have someone to save a seat have to stand around and wait. Don't do this, you are an asshole if you do this.
