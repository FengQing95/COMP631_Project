Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We came on a NYE, so they were only open to those that reserved a table ahead of time.  I'm not sure how the crowd or the wait is for regular nights.  The food was decent.  We ordered their much raved about huge burger, which was actually just okay to me.  That burger's got nothing on Kuma's Corner.  For appetizer, we ordered the duck and goat cheese terrine, and that was a very generous portion, and it was pretty good.  We also ordered braised veal cheeks, and that was very tender.  The flavor was good, but it wasn't very special.  It tasted like pot roast. We also ordered a side of elote style corn, and we weren't fans of it.  There was too much lime in it.  Overall, it was okay, but I don't think I will be back.  Service was very good though.
