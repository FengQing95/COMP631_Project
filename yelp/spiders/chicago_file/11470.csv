Art Institute of Chicago////You will spend a good 5 hours here regardless of how heavily involved you choose to be in the arts and history. There is so much to review and you'll spend a good half day here. Time flies by so make sure you're parking meter is updated. I parked near the institute because I was lazy (I really don't have any other excuse) and it's 13 dollars every 2 hours.
