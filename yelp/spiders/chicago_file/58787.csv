Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////They have a beautiful section that turns into a patio which we got to enjoy now that the weather is getting nice. We had the seasonal sangria which was pineapple. I loved that it was not too sweet ,it was the perfect combination! We had tomato bread, papas bravas, croquetas , and my personal favorite the bacon wrapped dates and the calamari! Order a couple items and share them amongst your party. Great way to try a little of everything. Can't wait to go back!
