Little Goat Diner////Our meal at Girl and the Goat on our last Chicago visit was one of the best meals of our lives, so we decided to try Little Goat for brunch on this visit. We walked in around 10:30 on a Friday and we were quoted a wait of 45 minutes or so, but it ended up being much quicker for seats at the counter. They were out of oatmeal so we went with a cinnamon bun, cup of goat chili, and Indian style breakfast burrito. The chili and burrito were delicious - very flavorful. The cinnamon bun was disappointing - super dry. When our server realized we didn't like the cinnamon bun, she immediately took it off our bill and a manager stopped by to apologize and offer us a muffin or other pastry, which I thought was excellent customer service. Fun atmosphere, tasty food, and great service!
