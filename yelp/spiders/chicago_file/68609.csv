Little Goat Diner////1.) Mushrooms have no f****** place on biscuits and gravy. Now again, the subtext in the menu says its a mushroom gravy, but again i did not read that part, which is my fault. What is not my fault is that the mushrooms were slimy, added no depth of flavor, and seemed to be added to simply be different with no attempt at adding something special and integral to the dish. It made the gravy crappy, which otherwise would have been some decent gravy (gravy is a tough subject for fat people like myself).
