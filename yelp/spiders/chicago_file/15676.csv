Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was really good deep dish pizza. I have never had deep dish pizza before but this hit the spot. The cheese was really stretchy and the sausage was full of flavor. The pizza does take a while to cook so make sure you have plenty of time. The Sercice was only ok at the best however the service does not have much to do because they take your order downstairs.
