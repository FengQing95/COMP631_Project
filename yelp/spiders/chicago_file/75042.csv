Little Goat Diner////We were there around 10:30 pm on a Friday night, so even though they were busy, it wasn't slammed like it would be during dinner hour.  Overall it felt very corporate and the staff was not nice, we tried to flag down other waiters during our short time there but no one seemed to notice or care.  I won't be back.
