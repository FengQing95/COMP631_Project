Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I love Lou's!! There's probably going to be a wait if you go on the weekends but you cannot beat the pizza. Once you get a table it takes about 40 minutes for your pizza to arrive (unless they let you order while you're in line, then it's a little shorter). I always get the Malnati Chicago Classic and I love it. Lou's offers a special "butter crust" that is simply unbeatable. You can also get a "sausage wheel" on any pizza, which is exactly what it sounds like and absolutely delicious. The service is friendly and the family sized salads are a great investment if there's enough people in your party. Deep dish pizza isn't even my favorite kind of pizza, but I love going to Lou's!
