Art Institute of Chicago////I walk into the museum and not only is everyone carrying bags that were way bigger than mine but in the very first exhibit I saw a woman with a backpack! & no kid!!! I was also offered a stroller so I didn't have to "carry my baby in that thing". Rude. Just rude. I was almost in tears I was so angry. I've baby worn all over the country with my baby in the front and diaper bag in the back and I've never encountered staff so rude and unwilling to cut a momma a break. I felt singled out and judged.
