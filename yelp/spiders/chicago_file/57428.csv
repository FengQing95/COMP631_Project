Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Lived in Chicago for 3 years and already been here at least 15 times. It's incredible! Fun atmosphere, great for dates or big groups (went for a bachelorette party and they easily accommodated 15 people at one table). The tapas are amazing and inexpensive ($5-10 on average per tapa, plan to get about 2 per person, served family style), cheaper during happy hour at the bar.
