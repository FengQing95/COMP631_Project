Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I wasn't aware of the wait time and thought they had forgotten about my order until I checked in with the bartender who informed me that each pizza takes about 45 minutes. He told me this confidently, with absolutely no apologetic tone in his voice--which tells you that they believe it's worth the wait.
