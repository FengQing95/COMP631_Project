The Purple Pig////This place was highly recommend to me. A MUST for my first time visiting Chicago they said. And boy am I glad that I listened. This place is DELICIOUS! I went out of my comfort zone and ordered the octopus and crispy pig ear and it was an explosion of flavor. Really it was. The atmosphere is lively and staff are friendly. They don't take reservations. But I didn't have any issues as I sat at the bar. They serve the full menu at the bar. Prices are not cheap but definitely worth the price. They also have a full selection of wines. So you won't have any issues finding something that goes with your meal. And when in doubt, just ask the bartenders for their recommendations.
