Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Walking in right away we were greeted and sat in the basement part of the restaurant. The basement atmosphere in my opinion is completely different then the top floor. Once you go down the stairs you hear the modern jazz music and intimate atmosphere that is set up by classic lighting. If I ever come back I will request to sit in this area again.
