Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I must note that the food came out in "chunks", step by step, one by one. It was strange. It took about 5 minutes between each plate. The last one, the skewer, came out about 20 minutes after we had already consumed the others. This was the only pickle I have about the dining experience.
