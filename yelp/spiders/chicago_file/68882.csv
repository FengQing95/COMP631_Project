Little Goat Diner////I've been to Little Goat several times over the last weekend because I really love diners (White Palace Grill, Depot American Diner - RIP, Big & Little's?). No reservations, simple food done quickly and cheaply and with an abundance of butter. I was looking forward to Izard's take on this because Girl & the Goat is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago.
