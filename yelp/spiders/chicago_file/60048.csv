Smoque BBQ////-Food was awesome.  Loved the chopped brisket (little drier than sliced, but no giant pieces of fat) and the pulled pork.  Cornbread was the best I have had since moving here from the Carolinas.  Mac and Cheese was great - rich, and has a bread crumb and cheddar topping.  Beans were okay - too much onion for our taste.  And were mayo base slaw fans - so hated the slaw.  fries were huge and hot, and seasoned great.
