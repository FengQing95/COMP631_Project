Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My pizza was OK, but I have had MUCH better deep dish and was expecting it to be more than just OK.  I order the special crust, but it was a little hard, instead of crisp and lacked the flavor of a well-developed dough.  The toppings were OK, but could have used a bit more seasoning.  The sausage was bland.
