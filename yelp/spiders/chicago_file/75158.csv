Little Goat Diner////We were there on a family trip and had made a previous reservation. We called to confirm the reservation, on a Thursday at 7:30 pm. Arrived at 7:20 pm, talked to the host, she confirmed it would be a tiny wait. To make a long story short, tiny wait ended up being 45 min (so no point in making a reservation). We were five people, so they told us we were going to be seated as soon as the bigger tables were free. One group with six people arrived AFTER us, had a reservation after ours, were sat BEFORE. Another five people group arrived later, was also sat BEFORE. Hostesses was rude and simply answered "we are sitting people as they show up". Just as I am about to get super hangry, I talk to the manager and repeat the same words the hostess mentioned...and surprise, another group of five that just arrived is seated before us.
