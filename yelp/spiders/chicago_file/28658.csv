Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Had fried calamari appetizer (a little tough) and house salads (the lemon garlic dressing is to die for!) to start. House salad was really good sized, and had a lot of stuff in it. Had the Malnati Chicago Classic deep dish pizza, in a small size for the 2 of us. It was really good, with not too much sauce (a problem with a lot of other "deep dish" restaurants). Very flavorful, with the meat and cheese. And the crust! Wow, delicious - reminded me in a good way of the homemade pizzas my mom used to make with biscuit dough!
