Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Service was perfect. I believe my waiter's name was Brandon, he was awesome. Very friendly, helpful, and attentive. I could go on for awhile about how great the service was here I have no complaints or critiques. Brandon also didn't have to write down any orders, he memorized everything and it was very impressive to see that he didn't mess up anything.
