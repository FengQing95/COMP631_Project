Smoque BBQ////This place was so good! The pulled pork sandwich was huge and the meat had such a wonderful flavor. The BBQ sauce was uniquely a little more vinegar-y than most, but it worked. The fries, of which they give you a million, were very good and the homemade mac & cheese was awesome. This place is very unassuming--no sign of pretentiousness. The coleslaw, while not as good as my grandma's, was still pretty damn good. I can't wait to bring friends/family here.
