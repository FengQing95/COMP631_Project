Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////So glad this was close to the Fairmont Hotel where we have stayed.  I heard of long waits so we called in to get reservations for 9a.m on Friday.   Maybe it's summer but there was no wait.  However after 10 a.m, it was super crowded and people are sitting outside looking at their smartphones waiting to get in this pancake/waffle mecca.
