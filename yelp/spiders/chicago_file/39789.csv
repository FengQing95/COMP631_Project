Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've been waiting to get the chance to go to Bavette's for quite a few years now. I made it a point to get a reservation for my birthday. I made the reservation a couple of months in advance, and I definitely specified that I wanted a table on the lower level. This was a good choice.
