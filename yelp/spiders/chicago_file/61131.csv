Smoque BBQ////The baby back ribs were perfect: the outer crust was beautifully charred and caramelized; the meat had the right balance of tenderness and chewiness--great mouth feel--yet the meat came cleanly away from the bone; the flavor was sweet and mildly smokey; the meat was well selected, resulting in delicious, tender ribs that were not too fatty or oily, nor too lean and dry.
