Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Arrived at 8:30 am with our party of 8 on a Sunday morning. Told our wait was an hour do we grabbed some coffee and walked to nearby millenium park. Our table was ready in 40 min so be warned-if your whole party is not there they won't seat you and may give your seats away! We sprinted back from park. Large variety of choices on menu and portions are huge. So come with an appetite or split your entree. I had the Mexicans skillet-nice spicy chorizo with eggs, hash browns, avocado. Pancakes were light and fluffy but might as well have been dessert, it was so sweet. Service was fast and efficient but didn't feel rushed. Ask for half stack of pancakes to get a taste-that will give you two or three instead of the huge stack of 5. Overall, a good breakfast place but be prepared to wait at all times of day.
