Art Institute of Chicago////with all that aside, i had a great trip to the museum! everyone should drop by and kill a few hours appreciating art. they sell some cool stuff in the gift shop too. if you are lucky, you can purchase some prints of well known paintings for about $9.99 - they usually cost way more than that, depending on its size. also, you can find a wide variety of hard to find books.
