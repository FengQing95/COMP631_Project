Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is my most favorite pizza! 'Nuff said. (Guess not. I was instructed to write more. lol) Cheesy (no need to ever order extra cheese), the right portion of tomato sauce and other toppings --I religiously order onions, black olives and mushrooms. When I'm feeling extra decadent, I'll add Giardiniera peppers --YUM! And then there is THE CRUST! Lordy Lordy, what can I say. Let's try perfect, or exquisite, or untouchable, or matchless. They even offer a butter crust for those who live on the edge. It's ideal that they don't deliver to my neighborhood...I'd turn into a Lou Malnati's Pizza.
