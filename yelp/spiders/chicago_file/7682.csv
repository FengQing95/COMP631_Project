Art Institute of Chicago////Since you all know to go to the Art Institute to see "American Gothic" and the myriad Monets, here are some things you might not know - the Art Institute is a fantastic place for kids! The just-for-kids art exhibit in the basement of the Institute has actual works of art on display for young viewers, teaching them how to read the art (what's going on in this Chinese scroll?) and how the pieces were created (what is a camera obscura?) I fell in love with the miniature rooms gallery, too - you could spend hours gazing into these windows.
