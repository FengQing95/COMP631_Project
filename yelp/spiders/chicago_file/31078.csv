Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I arrived around 5 pm, and the line was already out the door. The host said a table for one would be 50 minutes, so I took my chance and sat at the bar to avoid the wait time. I recommend you try to find a seat at the bar if you're dining solo or with 2. Once seated, it took 40 minutes for my small Chicago classic to arrive. They suggest you preorder with the cashier to avoid the long wait, but even so, the wait is still long.
