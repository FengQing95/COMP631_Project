Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This place is OK. First - I would never wait in line for breakfast but my friends insisted we stay. The wait took about 20 minutes so it wasn't that bad. It was busy so I'll cut a little slack for the service but our waitress barely checked on us. The food is definitely good and everyone liked what they had. All in all to me the whole thing feels like a dressed up diner experience. It's a little prettier but rather utilitarian. You go, you wait, you eat, you get out. I doubt I'll be back without being dragged.
