Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Entrees were the filet and fried chicken.  Both delicious.   Sides creamed spinach (which was made with blue cheese) and Parmesan Brussels sprouts. The waiter was great, big guy, very attentive without bring pushy.  Dessert was off the chart.  Chocolate pie and lemon merengue pie were spectacular!
