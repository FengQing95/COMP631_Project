The Purple Pig////I decided to try this place out on a friend's recommendation and they did not disappoint. In town to celebrate a birthday the waiter made sure we felt like VIPs. The food was quick to arrive and simply delicious. Many of the items on the menu were things we weren't familiar with however each one was unique, full of amazing flavor and gone in record time!
