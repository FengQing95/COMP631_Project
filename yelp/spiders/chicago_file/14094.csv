Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza was nice.  I got a classic and a lou's special.  The sausage on the classic was awesome.  It was the beat part of the pizza.  The crust was also nice.  There was a little less cheese than I'd have liked.  The sauce was almost flavorless.  And it had big tomato chunks, which I am not a fan of.
