Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////At the end of the night we were having such a great time, it's clear the overall experience of the place went a long way in coloring the food with rose-tinted glasses. The booth, the music, the vibe, Hitchcock, the STEAK SALT, we were powerless to resist! Â So I guess if you leave a place feeling that good, even almost-great food is enough to make the entire thing feel like you hit the jackpot.
