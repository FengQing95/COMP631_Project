Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////What makes their pizzas good is the crust. BUTTERY. GOODNESS. You MUST get the Malnati Chicago Classic for the buttery crust - you can get it with sausage or pepperoni. The crust is a game changer. The tomato sauce was a bit on the tart side for my taste but it didn't bug me too much. Perfect amount of cheese. Decent amount of sausage. Also the Malnati salad was a good appetizer to get while waiting for your pizza to finish baking. It's light and refreshing and the sweet vinaigrette is the icing on top.
