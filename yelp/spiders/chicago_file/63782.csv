Smoque BBQ////When I crave BBQ, all I want is Smoque. The sliced brisket is the best I've ever had, and you can't go wrong with the mac & cheese, cornbread, cole slaw and fries. It's a casual place where the line goes pretty fast-- we waited about 25 minutes on a Saturday night for 4 people. Your whole party has to be there before getting seated.
