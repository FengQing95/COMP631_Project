Little Goat Diner////A cute, casual diner with top-notch food. I got a satisfying bowl of the Not Chinese Broccoli (but too small of a serving to be worth $8) and a slightly chewy but perfectly seasoned Kalbi Beef Ribs with watermelon. The watermelon complimented the meat so well, love the creativity! My partner got some sort of Tonkatsu and cauliflower rice salad, which appeared on their "Special/Seasonal" menu. It was all great.
