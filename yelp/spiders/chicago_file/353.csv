Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////You'd think that there would be plenty of good breakfast joints in the Loop. I mean, we're no Wicker Park/Bucktown/Lincoln Park/Belmont, but we're still in one of the most vibrant and tourist-infested parts of the city, not the mention the heart of Chicago's business district. That said, I've been to plenty of hit or miss diners and restaurants. Wildberry is a hit, big time. It sucks that they're only open for breakfast and lunch. I'd totally have their brunch-y food for dinner any day.
