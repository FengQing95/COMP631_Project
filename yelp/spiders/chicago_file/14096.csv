Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The biggest knock against this place is that the beer selection is just as bad as most pizza places in Chicago.  On draft you can get miller, Sam adams, and 312.  Very boring choices.  This is beer for people who don't really like beer, but prefer water with a little beer flavor in it.  This kind of pizza just cries out for a good beer to go with it.  Some Bell's from MIchigan or schlafly from St Louis would really take this place to the next level.  I probably would have given them another star for good beer.
