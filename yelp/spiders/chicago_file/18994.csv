Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Recently, I started following Chicago Food Authority on Instagram and it is now one of my favorite pages. Creator and fellow food blogger, Samantha Roby, inspired me to explore the food scene of Chicago with all of her fabulous photos. So, as soon as we got the chance, Alex and I took a trip to Chicago to see what all the buzz was about. Now, we all know that Chicago is known for their deep-dish pizza, so naturally that was at the top of my "things to eat" list. After getting some advice from a few locals, we decided to check out the deep-dish pizza at Lou Malnati's.
