Little Goat Diner////Since I didn't care enough to plan ahead and get our group a reservation at Girl & the Goat, we ate at Stephanie Izard's other restaurant, Little Goat Diner, instead. Reservations for Little Goat were available same-day on OpenTable. Our dining experience here was A-OK. Given the hype, I was expecting better.
