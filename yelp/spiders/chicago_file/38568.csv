Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Went to Chicago for a weekend trip. Very solid overall experience with the staff, as the bartender downstairs and the server downstairs (not sure what his name was but he had a California surfer vibe) were welcoming, funny, and helpful. The hostesses at the front were a little condescending, but I understand they get asked a million questions a night.
