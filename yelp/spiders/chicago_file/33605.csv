Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I am giving this four stars, which I think may be a bit generous, and here is why.  Our first trip was for dinner with another couple back in December.  Great atmosphere, very good service, great drinks.  Food was great (peppered duck and goat cheese, crab stuffed avocado salad), until the steak I ordered medium came out well-done.  Everyone elses steak came out impeccable and stupidly I did not send it back, but rather ate it.  So that is on me.  I view this as a one-off error and probably not a reflection of a continued occurance at Bavette's.
