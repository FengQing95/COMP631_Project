Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I arrived around 8 PM on a Saturday night and the place was packed. I gave them my name and was told it would be in approximately 30 minute wait for a table or I could just sit at the bar. They also recommended placing the order for my pizza ahead of time since the pies generally take around 30 minutes to prepare. They have a chart on the wall near where you check in illustrating the sizes of the different size options  ranging from personal to extra-large. I was famished and was concerned the "small" size (one step up from personal) would not be sufficient to satisfy my appetite. The lady at the check in desk was correct, the "small" sized "Malnati Chicago Classic" (  Lou's lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust) pie shut me down like a pile of bricks.
