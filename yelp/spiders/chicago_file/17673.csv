Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ate at Lou Malnati's Pizzeria during our stay in Chicago in October. It was very windy and cold so a deep dish pizza seemed like the perfect end to our day. We had a 45 minute wait, not even during prime-time dinner hours. It was like 3:30pm. However, while we waited we could put our pizza order in which was fantastic since these pizzas take awhile to cook. When we were seated, we got some drinks and still had a bit of a wait.  This was my very first taste of Chicago deep dish and we were very impressed! The crust was thick and buttery, and the cheese perfectly melted and sauce on top. We couldn't finish our pizza so we had to take half of it back to the hotel.   I can't wait for my next trip to Chi-Town this year so I can go back to Lou Malnati's. I'd like to be able to try other toppings and flavors and maybe get a salad. So I can justify eating loads of cheese and buttery crust. Oh yeah.
