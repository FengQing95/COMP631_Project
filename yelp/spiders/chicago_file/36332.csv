Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Ordered a pre-dinner cocktail and was pleased to get the big clear cube of ice.  That was fantastic.  However, ordered a cocktail after dinner and it came with the smaller ice while my friend's came with the big ice again because he specially requested it.  Not a major thing,  but irksome because it was a choice by the bartender not to give me the best possible drink.  Putting it plainly, they skimped on me and I knew it.
