Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////There are a million great things to say about Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! From their drinks to their wide variety of tapas plates, every thing is fantastic. It is tough to get a reservation on a weekend, so book in advance. I recommend the chef's artisanal cheese selection, warm potato and onion omelet, grilled squid, chicken and ham croquetas, sangria (red and white) and their mojitos. I have only been here for dinner, but I can not imagine them doing any thing sub-par. Amazing restaurant!
