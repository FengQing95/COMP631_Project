Little Goat Diner////On yelp a lot of people recommended the french toast with crispy chicken and it was good!! It had an egg inside the bread which broke open while eating the french toast, which blew my mind. The bread was really fluffy and super soft. After all the amazing things I heard about Little Goat, I dont know if the food lived up to my expectations, but it was definitely good. We did have to wait for quite on awhile, almost an hour, on a Wednesday at 6 pm. Also the dish I ordered was $16, which is fine because it's probably a harder dish to make, but just something to note.
