Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place is great and the pizza is amazing.  Every time I come the service is excellent and the pizza is fresh. I can't believe that guy Theo who is complaining that the server or the host Did not close out "his" tab at the bar. Do you want the server to cut up your pizza and feed it to you also? The servers, hosts, and bartenders are busy (hence the wait).  Perhaps the host can bring you a tissue so u can stop crying.  The problem with yelp is customers with unrealistic expectations that use this as a vessel to complain about things like this.  Sorry you had to walk up stairs. Sorry you have to close out your own tab.  The only thing I feel sorry about is the table after you that had to wait and extra ten minutes in line so your ungrateful self can have a table.
