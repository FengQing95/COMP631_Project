Art Institute of Chicago////Today was the official opening of the Modern Wing, and I have to say, I was impressed. The structure is a radical departure from the 19th century building that forms the main body of the Art Institute, but it's the perfect setting for contemporary art. While I don't love the exterior, the interior of Renzo Piano's building feels airy and bright, and natural light permeates the space. Contemporary architects have a penchant for concrete, but I was happy to find that the floors and staircases here are dominated by blond wood, which makes the galleries feel welcoming instead of sterile. And the Modern Wing alone seems larger than the entire Museum of Contemporary Art, though I don't know the actual square footage of either structure.
