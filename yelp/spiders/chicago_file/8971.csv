Art Institute of Chicago////I had so much fun just wandering around. I did struggle with the layout at first, because some areas have a straight progression, but others are forked. Otherwise, this was probably my favorite part of the day. Â Plus it's right in the middle of the park so its easy to hit both those spots at once!
