Art Institute of Chicago////Ok  I broke my - you will have to torture me to get me to give  5 stars rule.Why? because this is one of the worlds great art museums.Once again I'm reminded that Renoir was actually pretty good not just a painter plump women with red hair.You have Seurat's La Grand Jette, Caillebotte's Paris Street ,American Gothic ,Nighthawks ,Some nice El Greco's ,some Manet's I didn't realize were Manet's, a nice Munch I din't know was Munch,one good Rembrandt,statues of Ganesha and Nandi, and on and on - it's overwhelming !Spent about 5 hours here.Oh and don't forget the Thorne Miniature rooms which are unique(like super doll houses as art objects).Which reminds me there is also a far amount of Joseph Cornell and there was even an Arshille Gorky painting I liked.Go out to eat.Do look at the sculpture garden ,do go to Millennium Park next door almost.Oh do go to the Chagall windows - I don't think ( as if anyone cares) much of Chagall as a painter but his windows are pretty.(pretty is an important art criticism word).
