The Purple Pig////Friendly and helpful staff. Clean restrooms with good smelling soap and very moisturizing lotion. They have recommendations for wine pairings with each dish and as someone who doesn't usually drink. The pork Secreto really surprised me. I expected it to be delicious but it still surpassed my expectations. We also ordered the Crispy Pig's Ears, Grilled Broccoli with Anchovy Vinaigrette, Pork Belly, Octopus a la Plancha.
