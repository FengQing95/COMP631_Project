Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our first time having Chicago-style deep dish pizza was at Lou Malnati's and we loved it! He had The Malnati Chicago Classic, which had sausage, cheese, and tomato sauce on buttercrust. I had The Lou which is their vegetarian option. It had mushrooms, spinach, tomato sauce and cheese. Both were flavorful and delicious! Definitely coming back here when we come back to visit Chicago.
