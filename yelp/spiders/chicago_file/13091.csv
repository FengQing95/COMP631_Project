Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////On my Chicago food tour we had to go to Lou Malnati's because everyone said to.  For a guy from California that loves his pizza I guess I just can't fully appreciate a deep dish like I'm supposed to because I just thought it was ok.  We got the chicago classic, I took the left-overs and fed a bum.  I would give it another try if we went back but certainly not the first place I would go.
