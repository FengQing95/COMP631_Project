Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It will take a long time to get your pie, because it takes a long time to cook, but you can pre-order at the hostess stand so that when you are seated, all they have to do is put it in the oven.  Even so, if you're in a hurry, don't come here.  If you have time to enjoy a special meal with family and friends, you won't be disappointed.
