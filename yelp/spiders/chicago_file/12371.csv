Art Institute of Chicago////Check and see if your company allows for free admission with their corporate sponsorship agreement! I feel blessed that my organization allows myself and a guest free admission upon request as there are so many exhibits worth seeing and not enough time to take it all in in one trip. What I appreciated most was that even amongst some of the more recognizable pieces (Nighthawks, American Gothic etc.), crowds didn't nearly gather as much like I've seen in other art museums. The museum does a fantastic job in providing an experience for all ages but also maintaining and environment conscious of keeping everyone healthy.
