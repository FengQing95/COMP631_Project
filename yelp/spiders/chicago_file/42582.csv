Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////By far my fave Spanish tapas restaurant, consistently, for over a decade. A great hit born out of Lettuce Entertain You and there's a reason why this spot is jam packed weekday through weekends. The sangrias are delightful and the wide range of tapas offers something tasty for just about everyone. I highly recommend reservations, especially on the weekends. My go to tapas are: gazpacho, spicy potatoes, the garlic potato salad, beef skewers, seared scallops, seafood paella,fried chicken thighs & bacon wrapped dates. I also order a "michelada" which is Â a Bloody Mary with ice cold beer instead of vodka. This place is very consistent and never disappoints. Very lively atmosphere, not a place to go for intimate conversations.
