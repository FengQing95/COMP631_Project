Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////What really added the finishing touch was our waitress brought out a complimentary platter with 5 of their desserts to make up for the moving rooms/flooding incident. The butterscotch one was really tasty.The manager came and checked on us and apologized at the end of the meal as well. Awesome environment with high class service and absolutely delicious food! Can't believe it took me two years in the city to make my first visit here. I'll definitely be back!!
