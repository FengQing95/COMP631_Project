Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We preordered our pizza while waiting in line, definitely reccommended if you are in a time crunch.  We were on our way to the train station, and this saved us at least 20 minutes of waiting at the table.  Service was great, and the kids even loved their meals of burgers, spaghetti, and chicken.  A definite winner!  I might even try ordering one to be shipped to Michigan someday.
