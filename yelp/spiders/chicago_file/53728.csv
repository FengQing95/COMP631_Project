Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Missing the mark were the scallop empanada (the scallops were buried in all the bread, while the seared scallops were much better), and the grilled flank steak, which was tough. The fingerling potatoes that came with it were good, although that was $9 wasted for such a small, disappointing dish. My cousin also ordered the citrus cured salmon, and was disappointed because it was flattened and thin like paper. Thinner than even smoked salmon usually is, and I think he was expecting a filet, even if it was a tapas-sized one. Yet for our first try, this was not bad.
