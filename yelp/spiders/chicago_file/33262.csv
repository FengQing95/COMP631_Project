Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////After a visiting the Merchandise Mart it was so easy to walk over to Bavette's. I liked the atmosphere and and the interior was creatively designed. I am not much of a steak eater but a friend offered to split a prime ribeye steak with me. I'm happy she did because it was made well and cooked right. They also had a large selection of Scotches, bourbons and whiskeys. Â As a Scotch drinker I wanted to try bourbon and asked for the waiter's recommendation. He told me to Breaking & Entering and it was a great choice because I enjoyed it with my meal. Everyone I was with liked their meal very much. I would come here again.
