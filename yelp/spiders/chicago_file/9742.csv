Art Institute of Chicago////The collection of art here is impressive.  Be prepared to spend the whole day here as one room leads to the next and the next and the next.  The museum itself is window to another piece of art, the skyline of Chicago.  One minute you'll be viewing a piece of art and the next minute staring out the window to view the magnificent city.
