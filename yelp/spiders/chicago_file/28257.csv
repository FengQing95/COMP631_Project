Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Well we got turned around & around and finally called an Uber, good thing too we were way too far away to continue the urban hike. As you would expect busy at 8:30 on a Monday night, 25 minutes ok. Here you order your pizza so it's being made as you wait, ok that will speed things up. We were sat at a sidewalk table ordered our drinks and split the salad, the dressing intriguingly sweet and it worked. The medium pie tasted like spaghetti sauce with sausage on cheese filled not quite pie crust minus the butter part of the pastry. There are no choice of toppings only choices of pizza.
