Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The dimly lit and romantic but still casual atmosphere made for a great date night. Our server was super friendly, very attentive and helped answer any questions we had about the menu. My bf and I passed on appetizers and went ahead for our main courses. I had the 7 oz sliced skirt steak and frites and my bf got the 16 oz classic ribeye Chicago cut, both cooked medium rare. I added wild mushrooms to my steak and we had a side of the creamed spinach to share.
