Little Goat Diner////The menu is huge with all sorts of unexpected variations on classic dishes. Started with their rosemary and white chocolate scone which was AMAZING. Scones are truly hit or miss, and this place has got scone making down. I ordered the crispy shrimp cocktail, but it was not your normal shrimp cocktail. They were rock shrimp wrapped and then fried in somen noodles, Â with a homeade cocktail sauce. I was blown away by how good they were. My friend ordered the breakfast spaghetti with clams and crab, which was more similar to an omelette than anything else but definitely not an omelette. It was very interesting. Their moscow mules were great, and so was their spicy ginger ale. I would go back just for the ginger ale.
