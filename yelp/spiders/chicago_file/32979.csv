Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Couple of my friends who claim to be regulars kept telling me a meal at Bavette's is a must.  Finally I got around to it and the whole experience left me a bit confused.  The starters were absolutely fantastic which included a highlight of a roasted bone marrow, however my filet was way too salty.  Not sure if I will come back with so many other steak restaurant choices in Chicago.
