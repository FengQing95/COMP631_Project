Smoque BBQ////BUT: be forewarned that just tonight I spent an obscene amount of time waiting to order online, only to be dropped right when I was the next caller....THREE TIMES!! (I was caller 13, 5, then 10. ugh! ) I'm incredibly frustrated. I don't know what's wrong with the phone system, but SMOQUE, I hope you see this and fix it. Otherwise, everything else is truly fabulous.
