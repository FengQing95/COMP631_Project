Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The calamari was pretty standard fare.  The pizza was good, but I didn't really care for the crust.  It was crispy and buttery but it had the texture of dessert pie crust rather than pizza crust.  This might be blasphemy but I thought the crust was just okay and must be an acquired taste.  Sorry, Chicagoans!
