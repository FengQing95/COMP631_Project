Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This place is pretty decent but I honestly have been to better places in the city.  The location is nice but food that we got was just average.  They do have intelligentsia coffee which is a plus and the best part of the food was their signature berry bliss pancakes (but again I've had better).  Will not go out of my way to come back but if we are in the area well stop by.  Wait was 1 hour early Saturday around noon so be ready for that as well.
