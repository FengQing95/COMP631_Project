Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Experience: First time in Chicago and my first time having deep dish pizza. By coincidence, Lou Malnati's famously known pizzeria was a few blocks away from my hotel so we decided to try it out. When we got there my aunt realized how well known in Chicago it was and of course there was a line. They originally told us the wait was gonna be 50-60 minutes, it ended up being only 30! You could also track your how many parties are ahead of you through an app which was very convenient. Lou Malnati's also allows you to preorder before actually sitting down to get your food out faster once you actually get a table so that was another thumbs up!
