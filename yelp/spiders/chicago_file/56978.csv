Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of my favorite restaurants in the city! Tapas and sangria are amazing! This is a great place to take friends and family from out of town. My boyfriend and I like to watch football on the TVs at the bar sometimes when we need a little date night during football season. Also a good girl's night out place to kick back and enjoy with your lady friends.
