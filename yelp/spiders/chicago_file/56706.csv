Smoque BBQ////My bf and I split the pulled pork and brisket platters, of which the brisket was way better.  To me, the sides were the superstars.  Baked mac n cheese with perfect consistency, amazing baked beans, and a fabulous special side of the day - brisket chili.  You get 2 sides with platters, but you can add more for not too much, so I'd load up!
