Little Goat Diner////The atmosphere was relaxed as you would expect from a diner and the food was fantastic. got the Reuben sandwich and wow. I would eat that everyday. The coleslaw added a nice crunch and the meat was cooked perfectly. We split the goat tracks sundae to end the meal and again I was very satisfied. Hoping to go back and try more!
