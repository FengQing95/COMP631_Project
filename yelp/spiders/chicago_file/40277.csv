Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For the food, I had my mind set and was excited about the lamb chops, but as I was ordering, the waiter told me that they didn't have any and were taking the lamb chops off the menu. A real letdown, but I changed my order to the same as my boyfriend's, a dry aged New York strip steak. Before the food came, a server brought to us two massive slabs of their homemade sourdough bread and salted butter. Here is, in our opinion, the test of a good steakhouse. The bread was incredibly soft and airy, with a strong sour crust. The butter was immaculate -- the smoothest and creamiest we've ever tasted.
