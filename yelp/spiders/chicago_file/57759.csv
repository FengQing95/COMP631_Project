Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I was recommended this restaurant by a friend and I'm so glad I decided to go. The ambiance and food were amazing, and I loved the tapas style food. For drinks, we started out with a pitcher of the White Peach Sangria which was sweet and went a long way between the four of us. I also ordered the Rosemary's Ni√±a, which wasn't my favorite but was decent. The tapas menu was expansive so we had to try a lot of items. The Warm Potato & Onion Omelette took a little longer to arrive since it takes a little longer to cook an omelette that thick, but it was okay. The Spicy Potatoes w/ Tomato Aioli were crispy and so flavorful; one of my favorite items. The Handmade Beef Empanada was fried to perfection. We had a few other plates with burrata, sausage, shrimp, beef, chicken, and they were all delicious. I was worried it wouldn't be enough food for four people, but once you start ordering you can't stop! I will say I thought our server kind of forgot about our table sometimes but the food made up for it, and I will be trying again.
