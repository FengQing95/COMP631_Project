Little Goat Diner////My husband and I are huge brunch fans and really enjoyed Girl and the Goat, so eating at Little Goat has been on our "to do list" for a while. What a disappointment! First we got there and was told it would be an hour wait....that very slowly turned into over 2 hour wait! We kept being told "15 more minutes"...very frustrating.  Coffee was amazing, good baked goods but the food was "just ok". He had the Berandade Biscuits and I had the Spanish omelette  which were  both fine, but not amazing. Our table shared the dark chocolate chips pancakes which were good...but you put chocolate, syrup and butter together and it should be. Our friend got the pork belly pancake which was pretty good too. Overall the food was not worth the wait and we will probably not be going back anytime soon.
