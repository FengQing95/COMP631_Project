Smoque BBQ////Stopped by on a Sunday night around 8 to find a line out the door. Not crazy it length, but SLOW moving. While waiting in line a gentleman came out to announce they were out of both chicken and St. Louis style ribs. Wasn't planning on ordering chicken anyway but I was bummed about the ribs - but in the end somehow I DID get some!
