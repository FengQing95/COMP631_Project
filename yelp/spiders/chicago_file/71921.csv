Little Goat Diner////The biggest criticism of Little Goat is that the menu is a mish-mosh, as they say in Yiddish.  The audio playlist was another symptom of mish-mosh- the songs skipped from nineties hip hop to pops songs from the 2000s to current EDM.  I can understand how some people look at Au Cheval down the street with its much smaller menu and curated reel-to-reel mixes and make comparisons.
