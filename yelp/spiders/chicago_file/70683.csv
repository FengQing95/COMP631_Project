Little Goat Diner////I was really pumped to try something new and nothing was really jumping out at me from the menu, so I order the chicken and French toast. What did I eat? It had a bizzare mix of flavors that did not compliment each other. The egg was fried into the toast, which was cool, but I found a fairy large eggshell, quarter size, in my meal. Usually I would say something, but I barely finished my dish because I was put off by the flavor combo. The waitress was the best, super friendly, insightful, passionate about the menu and restaurant.
