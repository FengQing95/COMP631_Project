Art Institute of Chicago////What a nice place. Although I do think it felt more like a museum than an art institute. I came here on a Tuesday afternoon and it was definitely a tourist trap. I was in town during the Roy Lichtenstein exhibit which was a nice surprise. I walked the most of the museum and much of the collections were vast and I believe every single continent, if not country, was as least someway represented. The amount of things to see and read would take hours to complete. The famous American Gothic is located here as well. My issue with the main exhibit is that they place the profiles onto the wall and creates traffic jams. Lots of kids from schools were here at the same time too, which became annoying because they were running around , treating it like a playground. I did notice that all of the security personnel that worked here are black females, which was really odd. I got the city pass, so I am not sure how much it would normally cost to go, but I'd say it would be worth the money. Do not get the audio device though, it looks like one of those brick cell phones of yesteryear, and probably unnecessary as I didn't use mine once.
