Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////First time to this place in our daughters recommendation and we were so glad we went!! Tappas menu was great and the food was even better!! The bread they bring out was soooooo good with olive oil on he table already! Full bar menu and we split a bottle of Cava rose sparkling it was so cold and yummy!! Make a reservation and give this restaurant a go!!
