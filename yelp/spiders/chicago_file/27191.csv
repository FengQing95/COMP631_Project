Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was me in Chicago for a conference, and had to try the famous Lou Malnati's after it was recommended constantly by my friends. We had the Three Cheese Bread and the Malnati Chicago Classic, and let me tell you, it did not dissapoint! Both were absolutely fantastic, and a great first experience of Chicago deep dish pizza!
