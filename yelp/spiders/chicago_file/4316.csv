The Purple Pig////We ordered a few items and they were all very tasty. I'm kind of harsh on restaurants and 4 stars from me, means I loved this place. Items come out in not quite as small as tapas portions. I would have like to see the price just a little bit lower, the value wasn't the greatest. But let's be honest, I was on vacation. I can only eat at finite number of restaurants while on vacation, so it's worth it to me to eat at one of the best.
