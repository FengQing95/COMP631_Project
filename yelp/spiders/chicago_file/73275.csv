Little Goat Diner////Little Goat is a great place! They have amazing coffee and they food is always solid! They have a fab vegan menu (you have to ask for it - but it does exist) and a great standard one as well.  I've been there on multiple times and never have a bad meal.  They are always busy so do be prepared for a faster service (they need to turn tables quick sometimes) but they are always welcoming and will answer all your questions.  I enjoy eating at the bar to be able to watch the action but the booths and communal table are also great! The bakery bar is fun and has some great to go items when you're on the run.
