Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Two very friendly bar tenders welcomed us and offered us drink menus.  Looking at the bar we decided we needed cocktails even though they are not usually our thing.  Upon asking for a recommendation we were told the Old Fashions were a bit of a house favorite.  I had never had one before but I feel the bar is now set pretty high if I ever order another!  The bar tender took her time crafting our drinks not out of inexperience in my opinion but out of care and I could taste and smell every bit of it.
