Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////So, I've heard good things and I've heard ok things about this place. Today was my first time at BaBaReeba and I must say overall the food is pretty good. I've tried the spicy potatoes with tomato alioli which were delicious! Beef tenderloins & blue cheese were very good as well, nice and juicy, cooked perfectly. I wasn't a fan of the grilled squid though, it was rather rubbery. Chicken & ham croquetas were just ok, there was just nothing special about them. Their sangrias are supposed to be the bomb? I felt like ours was a little watered down..
