Little Goat Diner////The reviews for Little Goat are so glowing that it perhaps is dangerously hyped. This isn't a place for someone who isn't at least a little adventurous when it comes to food. Most of their offerings are very unique twists on classic dishes - the sort of thing that makes you think "I can't tell if those two things would be good together or not") although, clearly, most of the time it works out well.
