Little Goat Diner////Service was attentive and relaxed.  Our server, Allison, was friendly and knowledgeable about most of the menu, offering suggestions for both breakfast (served all day) and lunch items.  My friend finally settled on the pork belly pancake and I opted for the fish tostadas with a butternut squash soup to start.
