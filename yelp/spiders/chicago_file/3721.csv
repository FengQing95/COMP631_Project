The Purple Pig////Wowsers! This may be the best food I have ever had. I fact, on my 6 day stay in Chicago we ate here twice. The highlights: the pork belly, crispy pig ears and the deviled eggs. The duck and spare ribs were great also. The only thing I didn't love was the asparagus risotto, but it wasn't bad, I just wouldn't order it again. It just wasn't what I expected. We shared a table with another couple and luckily they were as crazy as us because we let each other try our food. The flavors are impeccable and you will not be upset that you tried this place.
