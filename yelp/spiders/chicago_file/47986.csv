Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My twin and I decided to make Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba our dinner destination for our sister's small bachelorette party (we were four in total). We made a reservation for 7:30 on Saturday. I called the morning of and asked if they could surprise our table with a dessert--"anything with chocolate" was my description. The manager not only agreed, but promised an assortment of desserts on the house. He was true to his word!! This was really superior service for the restaurant.
