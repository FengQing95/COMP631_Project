Little Goat Diner////came here w another couple for brunch and sat outside on the patio. it was lovely. they have an entire vegan menu which is amazing. i got the bibimbap bowl and it was very tasty but also healthy. they have a great selection of food and drinks here plus the ambiance is nice i definitely recommend!
