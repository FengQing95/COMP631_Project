Little Goat Diner////We went in on opening day and they had some problem in the kitchen so it was closed for an hour but they asked if we were willing to wait.  We didn't want to wait an hour!  Went back a couple of days later but only got dessert which was good.  I can't wait to go back for a meal. Service is really good.
