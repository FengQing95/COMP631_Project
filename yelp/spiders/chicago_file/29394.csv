Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Finally, we were able to get to a table up on the second floor. Service was very friendly and efficient for how busy it was! Shared a simple salad to feel a little bit better about all of the calories we were about to inhale. This Chicago deep dish pizza was so decadant, buttery, delicious. This was my first time trying Chicago pizza, and for it to be Lou Malnati's... now nothing else can compare! Would highly recommend.
