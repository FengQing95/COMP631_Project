Art Institute of Chicago////When I was younger, I remember seeing lots of pottery and not as many of the famous paintings. Then when my friend from out of town was visiting, we ended up seeing the pottery again. If you walk in the order of the museum (from the main entrance), you will not get to see the famous paintings, especially if you are visiting on a free day when there are only 2 hours or if you are in a time crunch.
