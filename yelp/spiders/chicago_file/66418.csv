Little Goat Diner////Like Girl and the Goat, this place is a bit overrated. Often, the wait is way too long because of its association with Girl and the Goat. There are plenty of good places around it that you can visit if the wait is long. With that said, it's not bad. It has above average diner food with above average prices.
