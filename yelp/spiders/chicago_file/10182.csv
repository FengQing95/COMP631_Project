Art Institute of Chicago////Lovely museum, truly. The impressionist gallery was beautiful. The contemporary galleries were amazing. I feel like I only saw half of what I wanted but hey its ok. Lovely layout. Could use some dusting tho! what is going on with the cleaning crew ppl? All dust bunnies under those benches. Beautiful flow, lovely light and works on display were great. The kids enjoyed it as did everybody else. Awesome that kids 13 and under are free
