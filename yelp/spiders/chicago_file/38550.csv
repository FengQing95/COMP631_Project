Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Absolutely amazing. Ideal if you want to bring the romance, it is very classy and dimly lit throughout. But it's the food that earns them the 5 stars. We started with the steak frites, which has a side sauce that tastes kind of caramelly but not sweet, just delicious. Really good steak, up there with the best in the city. No joke. For the sake of variety, we also shared the spiced fried chicken with mashed potatoes. Oh yes. This is fried chicken taken to the next level, extremely flavorful. We were fighting to savor instead of devour it immediately.
