Smoque BBQ////We're always loved Smoque, so when it came to picking a wedding caterer this was a no-brainer. Peggy was amazing to work with, everything went smoothly and we got SO many compliments on our wedding food. Highly recommend eating at Smoque in general, and also using them for any catered events you might have.
