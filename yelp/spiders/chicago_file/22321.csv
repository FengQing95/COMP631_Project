Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my first deep dish experience and I was not disappointed at all. The pizza was excellent from the crust to the filling, paired well with an ice cold coke. Even though the wait time was quite long, it was amazing of them to have a system where you could put in your pizza order so when you sat down you barely waited. That was super clutch. I would recommend this place to tourists for sure.
