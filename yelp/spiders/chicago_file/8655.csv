Art Institute of Chicago////My time run out and only got to see parts of it. I recommend to plan ahead what you want to see here. It was pricy but it worth it because so many rare items are exhibited not just famous paintings. It was my first time seeing European armors in real. Art nouveau furniture and ceramics were nice to see.
