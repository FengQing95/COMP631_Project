Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is a must visit when we are in Chicago.  Full food service at the bar if you can find a seat and the bartenders are always excellent.  Expect a 45 minute wait for deep dish.  Dont get pissy at the bartender because you didnt know that.  Get an appetizer and drink or two.
