Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been here few years ago and loved it then. Visited it again last night and I liked it. Their service and staff is greaaaat, whatever we requested to staff may it be seating or food request they accommodated it. However, we ordered peach sangria pitched and felt like there is literally no booze in it. Also, as a vegetarian I did not find much tempting options in their vegetarian section and whatever we ordered was okay and not too great.
