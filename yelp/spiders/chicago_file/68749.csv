Little Goat Diner////I am generally a fan of Stephanie Izard's but have just found the dishes at Little Goat to be bland and oversalted. The Goat Almighty was particularly tragic, an egregious exercise in the "bigger must be better" school of thought. I made several attempts at Little Goat, and the one reliable standby I found were the fried pickles and onion rings.
