Art Institute of Chicago////I will always remember groaning as I signed up for an Art History class in college, yet loving it more than all my other courses.  Thanks to that class, I'll never forget my summer in Italy when I got to experience Michaelangelo's David and the Duomo in Firenze.  Not to mention the street artist that enthralled me and my friend at dusk for an hour and a half in a discussion about art and life in general.
