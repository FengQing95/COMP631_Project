Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I used to come here a lot and also grew up eating Lou's from their restaurant in Wilmette. Their service is fast and they also have great deep dish pizza! One thing I don't like is that they don't put a lot of sauce on their pizzas but I still give it 5 stars because I love their crust and the cheese!
