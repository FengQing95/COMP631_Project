Little Goat Diner////Everything on the menu looked delicious, but I ended up ordering the Bulls Eye French Toast (per a recommendation from the waiter).  It was AMAZING.  It's french toast with a circle cut out of the middle and an egg cooked inside, topped with lightly fried chicken and strawberries.  I was worried it might be heavy but it was the perfect amount of cube shaped fried chicken pieces.
