The Purple Pig////I know I am late to the game but I made it to The Purple Pig. I really enjoyed the food and the ambience. I wish I came here sooner. Definitely come here early because people line up before it even opens. Luckily we came right at 11:30a and didn't have to wait at all for a table. There are a decent amount of seats. A lot of communal seating for the larger groups and a lot of single tables for couples. We decided to sit inside and it was nice and cozy. I know it would be a great date spot for you looking for a date spot.
