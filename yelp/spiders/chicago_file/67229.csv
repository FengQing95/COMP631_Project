Little Goat Diner////I have Celiac disease, so I am always looking out for gluten free brunch. They have sourdough pancakes, one extra star for that, but the pancakes were burnt. The hash browns were salty, I have had better hash browns. But they have a vast menu and my friend ordered Paratha Burrito, which he said was great. Overall a good experience. But, if going on weekend plan almost hour before because there is a long queue. Enjoy!
