Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We started out with a pitcher of sangria (obviously) before diving into the food. The sangria was good, not to mention you get 8 full glasses for $21! We decided against ordering paella, preferring to get as much variety thru the small plates as possible. We ordered the brussel sprout salad, spicy tomatoes, braised short rib, shrimp with garlic, pork belly skewer, and the bacon wrapped dates. Each dish was excellent, I would challenge anyone to come up with a criticism! For me, the braised short rib stole the show, but I'd put every other dish at a close second. We finished up our meal with a few dessert selections, which were a bit lackluster compared to the entree plates (-1/2 star). The other half star goes to the noise level, which was quite high, although some areas of the restaurant may be better than others.
