Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The food was good, but the service is what made this less of an experience for me.  I didn't feel it was worth the insane wait - especially with nowhere to sit or go to while you waited, and it was such a hot and humid night...  They were understandably busy so flagging down our waitress was difficult, even to just pay and leave.  Perhaps if we had gone at an off-peak time I would have liked it more, but it wasn't a meal I'll remember of my Chicago trip.
