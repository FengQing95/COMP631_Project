Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Never disappoints when it comes to small plates.  Food is always consistent and the staff is friendly.  We held our rehearsal dinner in one of the private rooms; The management is accommodating, we had a dedicated wait staff, and our guests were well taken care of.  Do yourself a favor and get the bacon wrapped dates.
