Smoque BBQ////Last time we sat between two groups and had so much fun.  One group was a bunch of older guys who has been friends for years and were a kick.  They had a cooler of beer and offered us one.  So, my point is 1) BYOB and 2) you will share a table with other people.  Make the most of it and enjoy meeting them.
