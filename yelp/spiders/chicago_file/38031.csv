Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As soon as we sat we asked for the bread basket since we were hungry and man, that sourdough bread was good! I prefer the basket at Mastro's because of their variety but this was tasty. We started with the shrimp cocktail, which I have come to be obsessed with when I go to Maudes. It was just as good here. The sauces it comes with are out of this world amazing. We also tried the goat cheese and I did not care for that at all. I usually like this dish but the texture was chunky and I wasn't a fan. My mom and I also shared the wedge salad and they chopped it for us in back which was nice of them. I would recommend that. It was fantastic! It came with their famous bacon but I didn't eat any. My friend tried it and loved it.
