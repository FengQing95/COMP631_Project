Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Let me say for the record... I adore Spain and tapas!!!! I wanted a romantic dinner and my husband delivered! We arrived and had a glass of sangria. I'm a light weight and my man loves ales. Lol. The sangria was excellent. Ok, two glasses are my limit. Â Alright three but I'm stopping there.
