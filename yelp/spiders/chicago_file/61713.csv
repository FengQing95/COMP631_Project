Smoque BBQ////My only complaint, which will probably draw me stares of intense hatred in BBQ circles, is that there aren't really any vegetables options for sides.  I feel guilty if my meal doesn't contain something green, so I shy away from coming here as much as I otherwise would.  Hook me up with some green beans or asparagus and I'm all over it!
