The Purple Pig////After all the hype from everyone, we were truly disappointed with the food. The bone marrow tasted much like spreading butter on toast, very soft and an interesting texture for those who has never had it. We felt like it could've had more flavor, as it tasted very bland and had way too much cilantro. Also definitely not worth the price.
