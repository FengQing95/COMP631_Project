Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great deep dish pizza, so good we went back the next day for more which we almost never do.  Got the basic cheese pie with butter crust, goes perfectly with a draft beer.   Portions are huge and the pizza is really filling.  Price is reasonable and the service is very good but it takes about a half an hour for the pizza to be made and you don't want to go in very hungry or fill up on the appetizers or beer; the pizza is that good.
