Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I dined with two friends, and each of them ordered the filet mignon.  I had the pork chop.  Excellent food!  Even the next day, the leftovers were excellent.  We had a side of creamy spinach which was very good.  We tried to convince ourselves that it was healthy since it was spinach, but who are we kidding.  It was decadent.  I wish I didn't have to share it with my fellow diners.
