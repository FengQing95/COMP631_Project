Little Goat Diner////We stopped by here after being discouraged by a 2.5-hour wait from another restaurant on this increasingly popular street.  After hearing so much about it, and the plethora of reviews on Yelp, we were surprised to be seated immediately.  Having done no research except knowing about Stephanie Izard, we were delightfully surprised by the breakfast-all-day mixed with lots of Asian influences.  Faced with so many equally delicious sounding choices, we ultimately settled on the goat burger with kimchi and fried egg, biscuit with gravy, smoked fries, and a brandade with pork belly.
