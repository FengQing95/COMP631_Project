Smoque BBQ////( Licks BBQ off my fingers before I type) Can I say finger licking good?? Yes it is some amazing BBQ. I mean the meat is tender and not dry. The sauce is amazing! The sides the go with the BBQ are stars themselves. The Mac and cheese is soo yummy. And the sweet bread is so warm and fresh, taste great with butter to melt right on it.
