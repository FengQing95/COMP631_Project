Art Institute of Chicago////It was a bit disappointing to find some of the exhibit areas closed and also just a tip: if you are going here to see the Obamas exhibit, my suggestion would be to go to that section and get checked in first. On a Monday (not holiday) when we went we were #294 in line with and estimated wait time of 86 minutes. Had I known that, I would have joined the virtual line when we first got there. As is, we were not able to see the exhibit due to our flight time out of Chicago.
