Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Since we were there, we absolutely had to try the sangria! We had a pitcher of the white peach one, and it was one of the best sangrias I have tried. I also wanted to try another one and the bartender was nice enough to give me samples of them all. So my second favorite was the black raspberry followed by the passion fruit. The plain red was my bfs favorite, it really has that red wine flavor! And the sangria of the day was mango which was a little too sweet for me. I would definitely come back here for just drinks and small bites at the bar.
