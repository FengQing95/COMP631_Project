Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Deep dish pizza.. Obviously a must in Chicago. We got the small sausage pizza. Good enough for 2 people especially since there's a thick layer of cheese.  The bread was nice, crunchy and yummy.. The sauce.. Yummy!  I really liked how every bite had an even layer of sausage.
