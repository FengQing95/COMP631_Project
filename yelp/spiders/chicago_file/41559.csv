Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////No tapas meal can be complete without some sangria, and in this Ba-Ba-Reeba delivers again...perfectly.  We had the black raspberry, passion fruit, and the special of the day, mango.  Each one has enough fruit essence to trick you into thinking you were getting your daily vitamins, and enough alcohol to make the first part easier.  It was just simply perfect.
