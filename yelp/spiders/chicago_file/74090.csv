Little Goat Diner////The menu itself is quite vast with plenty of different options. I ordered the beef ravioli while my friend ordered the smoked corned beef hash with eggs. The food came out quickly and was very good! My friend loves the smoked corned beef hash and gets it quite often at Little Goat and it didn't disappoint this time around. As for my beef ravioli, I thought the sauce was delicious however I would have liked a little more beef and ravioli in the dish. I walked out of Little Goat feeling like I'd barely eaten anything and a few hours later I was starving again. Â
