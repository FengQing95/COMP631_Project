Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The half pitcher came first.  It was the perfect size for two diners, and was perfectly decent sangria.  The tapas followed soon thereafter, and came at a staggered rate so that we were able to complete a dish or two before the last of our order arrived.  With just 2 of our selections on the table, however, it was overcrowded.  By the time our last dish arrived, it had to be balanced on top of the clean small plates.  This was a crowded table and made for awkward dining!
