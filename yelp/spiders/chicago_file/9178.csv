Art Institute of Chicago////You just might have an epiphany while staring at Seurat's A Sunday "Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte". One of the top 5 museums I have ever visited. From works of Dali, Hopper, Monet, Mondrian, Rousseau and even Murakami! I loved the juxtaposition of Van Gogh and Gaugin's work together. I just wish they had the Bedroom in Arles piece. I loved seeing the paintings and other artwork of my favorite artists in person nonetheless.
