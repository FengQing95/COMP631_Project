Smoque BBQ////I had the pulled pork sandwich with a side of coleslaw and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was pretty good, as was the coleslaw, but nothing special. The pulled pork sandwich, unfortunately, was not very good at all. The pork did not have much taste to it and when I added more of the bbq sauce to it (which they give you on the side), it did not do much to add taste to it. I have had much better pulled pork elsewhere (Carson's).
