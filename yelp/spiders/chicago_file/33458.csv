Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's truly raises the bar when it comes to quality of service, food and atmosphere. A couple shout outs. one to Brandon, the Maitre'd, for setting a warm and welcoming tone at first impression. Second to Benjamin, my server, for being energetic, attentive, fun and full of food / drink knowledge. Third to the bus staff for reminding my guest and I to "sit back, enjoy and let us do all the work" (talk about adding an extra step of service, wow!). Lastly, the phenomenal back of house for offering us some of the best damn food in the city. THANK YOU for the superb experience!
