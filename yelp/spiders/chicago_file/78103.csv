Little Goat Diner////The diner itself is open, bright and spacious. All the employees are really friendly as well. We started our meal off with mimosa carafes, they were pretty good not overly heavy on the juice side. Next up with got the smoked fries AND the goat chili fries for the table. Both fries were good, but the goat chili were a standout! The flavor was delicious, the goat was cooked well and it didn't taste too goaty if that makes sense. For an entree, I got the parathas burrito. Now, being Indian and eating parathas my entire life I do have high expectations for a paratha. This one unfortunately disappointed. It wasn't as butter as what I'm used to, and the flavor of the overall fish was lacking. It needed a spice element, possibly roasted spiced potatoes? That would make it close to an aloo paratha and would probably be great with the avocado and the egg. The "this little piggy went to China" was really good. Flavorful, and the biscuit was soft and perfect with the sausage and egg. The Okonomiyaki was also very flavorful and a good choice. The fish tostadas were a surprise find; crispy tostada combined with crispy slaw and tender fish was a good bite. My friends also enjoyed the goat burger, but I was not a fan.
