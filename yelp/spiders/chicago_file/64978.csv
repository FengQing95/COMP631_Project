Smoque BBQ////Other co workers liked the barbeque chicken and pulled pork but I kept getting more brisket.  Anyone who knows me, knows I am a meat and meat and meat and potato girl.  So I kindof sampled their Mac N Cheese, Cole Slaw (which was more on the vinegar side) and Corn bread.   All sides were good.
