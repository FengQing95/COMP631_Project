Smoque BBQ////So why 4-stars and not 5? Well for me the barbecue experience has to have great sides. The sides at Smoque are great. We had a combination of mac & cheese, beans, coleslaw and cornbread. But --and this is really nitpicky-- I didn't think the sides were as good as the sides at Baby Blues BBQ in Venice, CA, another Triple D hot spot. But if you haven't had Baby Blues then you don't know what you are missing.
