Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Ambiance and food presentation get 5 stars. Food was good but not life changing. We ordered the bone marrow, whitefish Caesar salad and filet mignon and braises ribeye. Meat was cooked to order but the flavor was just kind of regular. I was a little disappointed considering the rave reviews on yelp.
