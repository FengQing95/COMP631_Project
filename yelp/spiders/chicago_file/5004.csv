The Purple Pig////The good: We loved our server Ty. My husband and I nodded after the first time he spoke to us in agreement that he was so hospitable. He recommended his favorites so in turn this is what I recommend to you: Gnocchi, Broccoli, and Pork Shoulder. Absolutely delicious, fresh, and came out fast! We did the short ribs too but we would've survived without it.
