Smoque BBQ////I've been to Smoque a few times, a line out the door is usually a good sign that a place is going to be worth the wait. Â The line at Smoque is always long, but it moves fast and even thought the tables are always full, it always seems to work out that someone is leaving just as I am finishing up my order at the counter.
