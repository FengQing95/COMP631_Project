Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Jim, I think we have a winner! I've found my new favorite tapas restaurant, and it's name is Ba-Ba-Reeba. HOWEVER, one major caveat. I simply will not go under any circumstances, without reservations and neither should you. Props to BBR and all other Lettuce Entertain You restaurants for having on-line reservations through Open Table... however, yesterday the best we could get would have been 10:30. So we decided to go with another couple and take our chances putting our name in. I have no problem with waiting, especially on a Friday night w/o reservations- and the wait was worth it (I'll get to that)- but I did have a problem with being quoted "an hour and a half to two hours" only to be given a real snotty response when I checked in after an hour and a half with the hostess that "You checked in at 7:53 and we quoted you up to 9:53. We have until 9:53 to get you a table." Oooookay... if I'd been rude or belligerent in the way I'd asked, I would have deserved the response, but that was not the case. It had me wondering though, what happens if they'd seated me at 9:54? Do I get a free bowl of soup for my troubles?
