Little Goat Diner////We ordered some smoked fries and nachos to start. Skip the fries, the nachos are humongous and taste so good. My friends got a bunch of other sandwiches, but the best by far was the Asian pork belly sandwich and this ridiculous Goat almighty burger. WARNING: If you order the burger, prepare to be full for the rest of your life. And maybe puke if you finish all of it that night.
