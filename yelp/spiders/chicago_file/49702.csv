Smoque BBQ////The brisket was good. It needed the additional B-B-Q sauce (a sweet sauce - provided) to enhance it. I also thought that it seemed to get cold around the edges of the bun. The cole slaw is the vinegar-based kind, which is not my favorite, but it was fresh, and I finished it all anyway. The brisket chili was quite good. It had a meaty flavor, even before I scooped up the shredded beef which had fallen out of my sandwich and tossed that into it. Every day, there is one custom side dish. If this is available when you visit here, you should opt for it.
