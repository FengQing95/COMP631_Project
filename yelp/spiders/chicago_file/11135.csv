Art Institute of Chicago////I had 2 hours to kill in Chicago by myself so I purchased a student ticket online($21) and took the train over. I got there right at 10:15 am and there was a huge line outside. I thought "great, I won't get any time in here" but then an employee said if you pre-bought a ticket you can go right in via the members entrance! (That is a #pro-tip as you will have no waiting!) There were 0 people at that door, so I went right in, checked my bags for $2 and was alone on the second floor looking at the most amazing art I have ever seen for at least 45 mins. It was bliss. As I got around there were a lot of people but it was never too crowded. This place is huge, much much bigger than I thought it would be and I missed out on a few things due to my time constraint but what I did get to see was worth the admission over and over.
