Art Institute of Chicago////Art. What is Art? It is the interpretation of whatever you want it to mean -- it can evoke your emotions or stimulate your imagination in many different ways -- the Art Institute of Chicago does this for me -- it is a beautiful museum with so much art that you cannot possibly see everything in one day. I've been to this museum over 50 times in the last few decades. They always have interesting, captivating exhibits. Art enables me to find myself and lose myself at the same time. It is great to view pieces of art that makes me curious. It forces me to relate to humanity with a solipsistic zoom lens that makes me want to understand the mind-set of the artist.
