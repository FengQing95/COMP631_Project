Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Solid food all around with most dishes being pretty good, and the service is friendly. It's a bit dim and feels a little cramped and grimy in the bar area, but it adds to the atmosphere in a way. It's a good place to hang out with a bunch of friends for late night tapas or drinks.
