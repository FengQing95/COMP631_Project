The Purple Pig////This spot is right off Michigan Ave, so naturally it brings a lot of traffic whether people are coming in on a whim or have it as a must go to spot while visiting. Since they don't take reservations, I imagine it to be busy whether you come for lunch or dinner. They take your name and number down and call you once a table is ready. This allows you to walk around the nearby shops if you don't want to wait. Our wait was estimated to be 45ish minutes, so my bf and I decided to grab a drink from the bar and wait indoors. If you're lucky, the bar area is first come first serve.
