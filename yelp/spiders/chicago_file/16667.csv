Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Looking for signature Chicago deep dish? This is definitely the place to go! Always great service, checking in and filling water regularly. Knowing that deep dish takes longer to cook, they inform customers and make sure that is ok. Salads and dressings are even stellar. Yum!
