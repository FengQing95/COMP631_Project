Smoque BBQ////It's good!  We had to wait in line that went out the door and down the sidewalk to about the length of the outdoor seating area and I thought it was worth it! Brisket was awesome :)  It's definitely more casual than I thought - it's an order at the counter kind of restaurant.  Free parking on the streets around it - just make sure you check the signs!
