Little Goat Diner////We knew we were going to eat a second dinner next door at Au Cheval, so we decided to share 2 smaller dishes. Based on reviews and our waitress' recommendations, we tried the goat chili cheese fries and the pork belly pancake. The chili cheese fries were nothing out of the ordinary. You couldn't tell the meat was goat and I felt that I could get the same flavor at any fast-food restaurant. The pancake was a savory mix of different Asian flavors. It reminded me of a Korean pancake (but not as good). I'm still not sure why everyone raves about it.
