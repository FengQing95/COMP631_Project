Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Overall, I think it's better than LA pizza, but not NY. NY pizza has a smoky flavor that develops in the cooking process that I dig. I wouldn't go to Chicago just for the pizza and it shouldn't be their claim to fame. I'll try a different spot next time I'm in town to make a better assessment of the city. I would still recommend this place for visitors.
