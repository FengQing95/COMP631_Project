Smoque BBQ////The mac & cheese was good -- there was just not a whole lot of it.  (Spoken like a true carb addict and mac and cheese lover, I know.)  It is baked with a crumb top -- served in its own disposable foil ramekin.  Tasty.  Especially with a little hot BBQ sauce added.  Yum.  Chicken (white meat) was remarkably not dried out, but not super juicy either -- Hubs said the dark meat was better.  Ribs were not fall-off-the-bone tender, but had a good taste for a dry rub.  Didn't really even need sauce for these.
