Little Goat Diner////Then, I decided to be adventurous and get the okonomiyaki - osaka street food with pork belly. It's basically a savory pancake/crepe. But wow, this was so mouthwatering. The crepe itself is SO fluffy! There's crispy little things on top of it that look like Rice Krispies which gave it the perfect crunch- not really sure what they were but they tasted like shrimp puffs/crackers to me. There's also some dry flakes on there which I think was maybe dry squid? On top was a poached egg and delicious sauce which just tied the whole dish together. There is also pork belly on it, but it's more like very very thin slices of it instead of thick cut pieces with fatty, which I was expecting, so I was a little disappointed, but it was still good.
