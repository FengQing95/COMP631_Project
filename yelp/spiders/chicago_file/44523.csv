Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Now, the one minor complaint that I have is Ba-Ba- Reeba packs you into this restaurant like sardines. If you suffer from Claustrophobia, I'd think twice about dining here on a busy night. Also, the one men's washroom, should say "circle jerk" on the door. The two measly urinals are so damn close to each other, your junk is basically all over the dude next to you. And, the one stall is even too small for a little person.
