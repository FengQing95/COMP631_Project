Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We were lucky enough to get an early dinner reservation at 6:30 on Black Friday evening. Great interior and atmosphere, very friendly and competent wait staff. We tried mostly seafood tapas and they all were very tasty. The three bite size "appetizers" (forgot how they are called officially) we tried were phenomenal. What's best, the food is done without the overdose of salt you occasionally find at top places like Girl and the Goat. Will definitely be back!
