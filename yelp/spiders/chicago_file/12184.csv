Art Institute of Chicago////In the attached photos you will find many of my favorites that were either beautiful or I had studied their history as a student. The Art Institute of Chicago is a definite must if you're interested in art; it's not like any museum I've been to and it most definitely requires at least a half day to just go through all the paintings and other art work. You'll find a myriad of categories ranging from time periods centuries ago.
