Smoque BBQ////I'm so glad I tried their BBQ; however, now I wish I lived closer.  Their pulled pork was moist and had great flavor.  I didn't even use the sauce I was provided (which is a shocker).  Their sides are delicious!  I had the BBQ beans, mac & cheese, and cornbread and no complaints.  I liked how their menu was limited w/ choices.  Sometimes restaurants have way too many items to choose from.  When I'm back in the neighborhood, I will be stopping by.
