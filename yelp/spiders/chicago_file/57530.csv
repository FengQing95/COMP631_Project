Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Very convenient curbside pickup! Highly recommend the bacon-wrapped dates, bread with goat cheese and tomato sauce, chicken empanada, and stuffed mushrooms! There are many tapas choices and their paella is full of flavor. Everything they say about the short rib is true. Do not skip trying it!
