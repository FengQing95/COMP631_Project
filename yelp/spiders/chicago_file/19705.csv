Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came here on business and WHOA it was good. We had a vegetarian with us so we went with the Lou and for the first time with a non-meat pizza I honestly think it was better. The cheese, the toppings, the everything was out of this world but the real singer was the garlic butter crust - a real high note.
