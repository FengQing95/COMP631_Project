Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////From my multiple visits I've pretty much had their entire menu, minus the paella. Â I would say on average all the tapas are above average, but the stand outs are the patatas bravas, bacon wrapped dates, anchovies, and the garlic shrimp. This place definitely gets super busy so make sure either make a reservation or fend for yourself at the bar. Overall, a nice place to get social, taste some treats and relax!
