Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is an excellent pizzaria! The variety of select items were fresh, the pizza crust and sauce were delicious for their Chicago "thick crust" pizza. I am happy I learned about this from a local fellow, near the U of Illinois-Chicago campus. Â  Setting was formal, but not stiff.. Perfect place!
