Art Institute of Chicago////WHAT TO DO IF YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME (Less than 2 hours): When you enter the museum, make sure you grab a map. At the back of the map, there are about 20 must see pieces of art. Their locations are stated on the map as well, so when you walk into a certain gallery, you know what artwork to look out for.
