Smoque BBQ////My favorite BBQ in the city! Ribs were tender and smoky and brisket was juicy and cooked to perfection. I love the sauce - tangy and not thick (more vinegar is definitely my preference). My 4 year old talks about this place all the time and recommends it to everyone he meets. The only downside of this place is the line! Come hungry but prepared to wait.
