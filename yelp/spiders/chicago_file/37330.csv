Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bakes potato was the shining star - best we've ever had. It came loaded and the bacon on it was to die for. The fires chicken was delicious and came with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy, which were very good and made it an economical meal compared to the other options. The steak was perfectly cooked to order, and was delicious served with Bernaise sauce and steak salt. I think it was priced about $10-15 too high for the cut, but no regrets.
