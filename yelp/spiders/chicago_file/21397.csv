Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my first experience with Chicago deep dish pizza and I gotta say it was pretty darn good! My mom and I came at 5:30PM, and it was already pretty crowded. We were supposed to have a twenty five minute wait, but we ended up waiting only five minutes! YAY! Also, if you had to wait more than I did, there's the option to order the pizza before you are seated, just because it takes so long to cook. Plus there's a really nice diagram in the front register area to see what the sizes of the pizza look like.
