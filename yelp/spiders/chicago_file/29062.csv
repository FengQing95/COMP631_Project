Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visited Chicago for my first time and everyone told me that deep dish was a must try when visiting. When I looked through Yelp, there were so many options to choose from, but Lou Malnati's had the most reviews and I was around the area so I gave it a shot. The menu was simple, and being my first time, I went with the original deep dish which consists of cheese, sausage, and tomato sauce.
