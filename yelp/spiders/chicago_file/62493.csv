Smoque BBQ////It may have been a mistake to try the most flavorful thing first, but it was just the cleanest, so I started here. The sausage was great. First bite, and you got all the smoky flavor and all salty goodness from it. Though it was good, it didn't set itself apart from your run of the mill store-bought sausages on the grill. For a first bite, this sausage was excellent. If you take 2 bites in a row, the saltiness starts getting to you. You know, I think this would be great on a bun. And don't try putting BBQ sauce on this, it's overkill!
