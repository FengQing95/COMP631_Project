Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's reminds me of the Bennigan's chain that existed in Miami once upon a time. It has that family style vibe and old Italian pizzeria d√©cor to it. It was pretty full inside, so we decided to sit outside and enjoy the delicious weather as well. The hostess promptly seated us and our server came. She wasn't very informed on the beer selection, however her recommendation ended up being what I was craving. We started off with some garlic bread and salad appetizers. The salad was good, not GREAT... Just, good. It would've been great if she would've let us know about the bleu cheese so this is just another example of how uninformed our waitress was of the menu. We also had some garlic bread which was warm and toasty, not over indulged in butter and garlic. After a 45 minute wait, finally the deep dish pizza arrives. We ordered the sausage one and decided to go with the small portion which my friends, was enough! It's cut into 4 and even with an appetite I was only able to finish one slice. Lou Malnati's deep dish pizza is reminiscent of the pizza hut and I say this because of the similarity of the crust, which also happened to be really thin. Deep dish pizza is literally the recipe for heartburn! At least this one was. Luckily I happen to like lots of tomato sauce but this was out of control. It was like a tomato sauce pie with some cheese on top. Did I expect something better? Kind of, but after hearing that locals don't usually eat deep dish I also kept my expectations at a realistic level.
