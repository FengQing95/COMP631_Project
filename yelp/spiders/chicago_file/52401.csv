Smoque BBQ////I have eaten here several times for lunch since it's located very close to my work, and I have yet to be disappointed. I love the Brisket very moist and tender with the pulled pork being second choice for me. I also love the vinegar based sauce, yum! Â I generally call ahead of time to pick up so even with a line, waiting has not been an issue for me yet. Still looking forward to trying the ribs!
