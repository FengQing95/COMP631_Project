The Purple Pig////I think it's one of those places in Chicago that you should try at least once. If you are a bona fide "regular" here, move along! Let some of us late adapters get a table, for crying out loud. I was able to steal 2 seats at the bar. Enjoyed the steak and some octopus. Small portions, big bill.
