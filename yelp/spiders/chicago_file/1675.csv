Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Wildberry Cafe is an ideal spot for your breakfast food cravings. They have all of the traditional breakfast dishes down to a science, and also have a number of interesting creative items on their menu as well. My favorite dish here is the Southern Benedict- poached eggs engulfed in gravy over sausage and biscuits. I go here at least once a month and have yet to be disappointed at all.
