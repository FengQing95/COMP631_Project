Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our server was courteous and quick in serving us, clearly too busy to chat do chat around with us. Overall it was good food, good service but the next time around I think I might just shop around for a bit longer to see what else Chicago has to offer since I believe there is a better deep dish elsewhere.
