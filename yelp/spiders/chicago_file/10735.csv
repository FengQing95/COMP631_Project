Art Institute of Chicago////I have Tutored Art, worked in a framing/ art gallery/ coffee bar, I have a still developing artsy side to me! Living in eight different states in the last 20 years has placed me in close proximity of some marvelous museums. When I travel I seek out museums before dining options or hotels!!
