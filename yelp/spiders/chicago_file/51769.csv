Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I had an early-ish dinner here with my fiance last Thursday, and we had a great meal. We were able to be seated right away arriving around 5:30. We chose the chorizo-wrapped date and the laughing bird shrimp for a bite-sized pinxto ($2/ea.) Hubs enjoyed his date; my shrimp was good, but I wasn't prepared for the actual strip of chewy white fat adorning the top of the skewer, which I removed and didn't eat. When they said "topped with fat" I guess I assumed it was drizzled with a little grease or something; I personally don't eat solid pieces of fat like that.
