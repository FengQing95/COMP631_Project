Little Goat Diner////Came here especially to try the cinnamon bun and was not disappointed. We came at 7:30, so I can't speak to how quickly they run out, but we were able to order two at that time. It was absolutely delicious, and I could've easily eaten two more. We also ordered a biscuit along with some of their other breakfast dishes, but I think where they truly shine is the bakery. Would definitely recommend coming here when looking to indulge in some decadent baked goods.
