Little Goat Diner////Attached at the back of the restaurant space is a full bar which also has a coffee bar.  So, if you end up having to wait for a seat, go back and visit and get a start on your coffee.  We ended up w/free refills once at the table based on our initial coffee purchase at the bar.  Not sure if that's how it's supposed to work but made us happy we didn't have to pay for another coffee at the table.
