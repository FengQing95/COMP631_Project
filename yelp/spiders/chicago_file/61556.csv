Smoque BBQ////I've only waited in line once, and it was long but worth it. Take out is even better though! Order ahead of time, no waiting, just Smoque deliciousness in the comfort of your own home. I like everything I've tried here, but that brisket and baked beans are worth noting, because I hated both of those things before I tried them at Smoque. The baked beans are unreal-great spices and nice, crispy pieces of bacon, but what really puts them over the edge is that they are smoked like the rest of the food. I had never experienced that before Smoque!
