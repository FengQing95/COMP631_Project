Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////A little back story, my husband proposed to me in August of 2013 - we knew we wanted a short engagement and literally just picked the weekend after my birthday in March (3/15 to be exact). After we got engaged and waited about a week, we already knew that CBBR would be it, we love the restaurant and the food and the tapas/family style plates and casual atmoshpere. Picking CBBR was just as easy as saying yes to him. Sure we had other places in mind (Carnivale, Tapas Valencia) but CBBR was more us. And it was important to us that we keep it personal, like we were just throwing a party. Traditional we are NOT. Plus, communication with CBBR was timely and friendly, which matters when you plan a wedding 6 months away.
