Smoque BBQ////I have been here a few times.  It is good bbq.I think the brisket is great. Every time I have tried the ribs I am slightly disappointed. I feel they are slightly over smoked.  They just are a little bitter due to the over smoking. Everything else has been great. Well be back but will avoid the ribs.
