Little Goat Diner////Arriving shortly after opening - a good plan considering the fact that every seat would be filled by 8:30am - and seated promptly at an oversized booth menus were presented and coffee was poured by a young woman named Yolanda who would prove every bit as friendly as she was capable of keeping my cup of Stumptown's Hairbender filled throughout our 90+ minute stay. Â Selecting widely from the large and eclectic menu but requesting that food come out in courses I really cannot say enough about the pacing of our meal, particularly as it is in the restaurants best interest to turn tables given their "no reservations" policy, but in a word it was perfect.
