Art Institute of Chicago////What an amazing experience. I had a few hours before my flight and hadn't yet seen this museum. People, this is a MUST. DO. before you leave the windy city. It is huge, so be strategic. I luckily went on a weekday...crowds very manageable. There is a coat check (right near tickets) so you can leave bags there and just enjoy the museum without hauling stuff around. Nominal charge. The museum map and guide tell you exactly where the world famous artwork is. So you want to browse and get lost in art, you can. You want to just hit the famous highlights (like me), you can. They have food cafes and gift shops. Bringing little ones? Theres a drop in learning center where the kids can draw and utilize art materials. Enjoy!
