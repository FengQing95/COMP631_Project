Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Meh. Visiting from out of town. Got the aged bone-in ribeye.  At first it came out room temperature, so I sent it back. Next time it was hotter, but still a bit undercooked. The steak itself wasn't great:  I honestly cook tastier steaks at home. The ribeye was grisly, and I had a tough time cutting through the silverskin with the provided steak knife.  At least I had a good Malbec and the bartenders were great. Tell me there's a better steakhouse in Chicago.  I recommend skipping if you're coming here for an exceptional steak
