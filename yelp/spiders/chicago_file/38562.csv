Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I goofed and meant to make my reservation for my boyfriends birthday, it's tough to get a res here so I went through the Reserve app about 5 weeks in advance to score a Friday night res and all that was available was 5pm ( that's fine) and I thought I made it for his birthday but I made it for the following Friday, accidentally.  The day before I was thinking, I should get a confirmation email or call and when I didn't hear anything I double checked my res and realized my mistake. I reached out via email to Bavettes, explained my mistake and was there any suggestions how the best way was to get a walk in table as I've always heard this place is tough to grab a seat. I received a response the following day that they had canceled the wrong reservation and had taken care of making the res for the night I needed, this was the day of and I was so grateful. I thought, wow, that was a real awesome way to start.  So grateful they worked with me and fixed MY goof.
