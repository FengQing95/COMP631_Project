Little Goat Diner////But people, we must talk about something really important here -- the choco taco. Let's talk about how I haven't had a choco taco in over a decade due to food allergies, and how the choco taco they have here is a) gluten-free, and b) A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! It's the little things in life that bring the simplest of pleasures, and this choco taco is no joke. You MUST order it!
