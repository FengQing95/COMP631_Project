Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I heard a lot of things about Lou Malnati's and so I was expecting something amazing.  Lets just say I was not disappointed.  It was my first time in Chicago and all we have in DC is UNO's which is a bit too doughy for me.  I wanted a pizza that would not be too doughy and at the same time fresh.
