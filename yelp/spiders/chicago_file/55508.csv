Smoque BBQ////Best BBQ in Chicago.  Been several times.  It's not as good as The Germantown Commissary which I think is the best pork BBQ in the US.  The last time I was there, the ribs were not as moist, and a little too dry.  Texas link was good-although I'd prefer them to be a bit hotter.  Cornbread was decent, and the mac and cheese was good.  Coleslaw was okay.  Kids had the pulled pork and they said it was very good (but not as good as mine : )
