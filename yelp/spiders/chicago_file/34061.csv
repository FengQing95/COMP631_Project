Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place did not disappoint.  We were seated right away and our server took amazing care of us.  We both had filets and they were cooked to perfection.  Couple that with great sides big enough to share and some red wine, an old fashioned (or two) and chocolate creme pie for dessert it was well worth every penny.
