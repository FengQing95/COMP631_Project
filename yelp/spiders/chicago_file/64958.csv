Smoque BBQ////I went with a friend and we pretty much gorged ourselves. I really loved the brisket and the pulled pork, particularly the former. The brisket slices were juicy, flavorful, and smoky. The fatty bit at the top is incredible and melts in your mouth like butter. The pulled pork was nice and also very juicy with a great smoky flavor. It was more chopped than pulled, but was still great. I disliked the St Louis ribs because they were too dry (I know they're dry by nature but they were not great and too spicy without there being enough good meaty flavor to interact with the spice).
