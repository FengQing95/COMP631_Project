Smoque BBQ////Being from the South I was raised on a steady diet of BBQ and I'm admittedly kind of a snob regarding the art of the "slow and low."  Most midwestern BBQ is too sauced-up and mushy (Folk around here call it "tender".  I call it regurgitated nursing home food.  Meat is supposed to be chewed at least twice before dissolving.  Ok, off my soapbox now...), so there aren't too many BBQ joints I dig around here.
