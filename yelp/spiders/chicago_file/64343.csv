Smoque BBQ////Was not familiar with this style of bbq but Husband and I LOVED IT !! Everytime we'd drive by here It had a Long ass Line of people Outside waiting to order Â and one day there were only a few people inside and that's when we took our chance and I loved Everything! the Fries, the Mac n Cheese, pretty much everything!
