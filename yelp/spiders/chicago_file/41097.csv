Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have only been to a handful of tapas restaurants but this place is so good.  We have eaten there many times and never had a problem.  You will not be disappointed.  The Sangria is delicious.  Before I went vegetarian, I loved the beef medallions with goat cheese.  The dessert flights are amazing too along with the flan!
