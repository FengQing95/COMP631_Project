Art Institute of Chicago////I love this museum. The more I learn about art, the more I appreciate what's inside. There are some amazing, iconic pieces in here, and the new Modern Wing is fantastic! Definitely one of my favorite museums in my hometown. Â AIC's collection is GIGANTIC and ever-rotating. It's impossible to see everything in one day, or even one year.
