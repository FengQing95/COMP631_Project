Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We ordered petite filet mignon with peppercorn crust, prime rib, mashed potatoes with roasted garlic and charred broccolis. Temperature of the meat was perfect and meat was delightfully tender. Shirley temple, lemon pie and french pressed coffee was also a great touch for after meal!
