The Purple Pig////The food was not tasty at all. Ordered octopus, pork shoulder and fried egg. None of them taste good, can't understand why they have 5000 reviews. Most likely they purchased the reviews. The service was terrible as well. I asked them for water in plastic cup for my little kid, but they offered him water in glass without listening and watching. At the end, they automatically charge me 15% tip from the price including tax instead of the price just for the food without asking. Felt not being respected. Are you guys really need money? Offering better food and services instead! Definitely never back! Highly NOT recommend!
