Little Goat Diner////There are people that rave about this place, but I didn't have the experience others seem to have had. We had seven of us for breakfast, we made reservations in advance, and they still tried to cram us into a booth for six...four of us on one side was way to small and they refused to move us to the larger open table next to us which sat empty nearly our entire breakfast.
