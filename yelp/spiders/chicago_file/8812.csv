Art Institute of Chicago////As you enter through the front doors, you pass by these enormous bronzed lions that gaze over Michigan Ave. I used to spend hours studying some of the art work here that I would often sketch for hours at a time.Then there were the playful days when we would reenact the 80's classic film. But something unique about this museum are the famous paintings. Its astounding to see such masterful works of art in person.
