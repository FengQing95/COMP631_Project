Smoque BBQ////One of the better places for bbq in Chicago. I love the sliced brisket here. It's always juicy and soft and can be eaten with or without the sauce. I've heard other people say that sometimes it can be dry but I've never had that experience whenever I order it. To me the pull pork is a bit dry but it's alright if you eat it with the sauce that comes with it. The St. Louis ribs are great as well. It has an excellent smoky flavor to it and like the brisket it can be eaten with or without the bbq sauce.
