Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Never had deep dish pizza before and this was my first food stop in Chicago. Guess we came at a good time as we were seated immediately and taken care of right away. Since we were starving we ordered a plate of wings and two deep dish pizzas. I had the mini pepperoni pizza and my BF had the Lou malnati. We definitely underestimated how filling one pizza could be.
