Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great service, great food.  Made reservations for 915 on a Tuesday, showed up about an hour early, got a drink at the bar, and promptly got seated early.  Ordered the ribeye, corn, and asparagus to share.  Everything came out SO quickly, almost suspiciously quick. The food was delicious and devoured. I would come back to Chicago just for the ribeye.
