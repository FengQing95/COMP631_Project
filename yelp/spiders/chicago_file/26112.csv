Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We started with a couple of appetizers to include bruschetta and a calzone like dish  Both were very good.  The martinis were also made well.  We each order a different pizza with the intent on sharing and taking the left overs with us. The pizzas were Chicago deep dish and we could have easily shared two pizzas and have been more than satisfied.  The pizzas were both very good but we served at room temperature.  Would have preferred them being hot.  Maybe this was because we had to order prior to being seated?  Not sure why but did not expect that.
