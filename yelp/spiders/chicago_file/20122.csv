Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was in Chicago for a couple of days so I didn't get a chance to try too many pizza joints. Sad to say I thought Lou Malnati's was pretty underwhelming, especially considering the long wait. Maybe it was the pizza we ordered (pepperoni and sausage). The sausage wasn't so great. I'm obviously not going to judge a city's pizza by one meal; I hope the next experience I have of the pizza changes my mind.
