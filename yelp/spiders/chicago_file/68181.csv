Little Goat Diner////  The last visit to this restaurant will be the last time I go back.  Breakfast for 3 was $70 for 3 dishes with inexpensive ingredients (not steak and eggs) and 3 coffees.  The over-easy eggs on two dishes were completely overcooked and not even runny.  A restaurant that charges these ridiculous prices should be able to turn out an over-easy egg.
