Smoque BBQ////Brisket: THE BEST brisket I've ever had. I'm wary of saying anything is the best in the city because I don't really plan to visit enough places for that statement to carry statistical value. However, it was amazingly tender and moist and melted in my mouth. I thought the portion was fair considering that BBQ is usually expensive. Next time I will probably just buy a straight pound of this stuff and forgo all the other food distractors.
