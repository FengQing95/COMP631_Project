The Purple Pig////Super yummy food, great service and cute atmosphere. Visiting Chicago and wanted to try it out. I would recommend making a reservation if your coming later on, but during the day you can probably get a seat without one. Gnocchis are amazing along with the broccoli. Also good lighting for cute pics! Xoxo
