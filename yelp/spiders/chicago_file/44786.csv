Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The service was top notch. Waiters were attentive and friendly. My mom twisted her ankle when getting up to go to the bathroom, but luckily me, a waiter, and a bus boy were able to catch her before she fell! The waiter got her an ice bag and another chair to elevate her ankle, and later the general manager came by to check on her! One complaint was that we got tired of waiting for the waiter to come back after paying our bill, but we were all paid up so we left anyway.
