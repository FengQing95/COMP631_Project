Smoque BBQ////Was looking forward to trying out this place.  Parking was very easy and accessible off the street.  We ordered our food ahead of time after hearing that it gets quite crowded.  Our food was ready upon arrival but we were not allowed to sit down at a table because other people were waiting even though we had already ordered our food.  There really isn't a lot of seating.  They are a BYOB which is a plus if you can get a seat.  We took our food to a park nearby and sat outside.  I had the ribs, Saint Louis style.  They were okay but I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce.  I do not think that we will return to this restaurant but I would recommend it if you're in the neighborhood/want to try new BBQ.
