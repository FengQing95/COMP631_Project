Art Institute of Chicago////I'll say that the Art Institute of Chicago is probably one of my favorite tourist attractions in Chicago.  It hosts a pretty big gallery and has a descent balance of modern, cultural and classical pieces.  If you enjoy art, you could probably spend the better half of your day wandering these halls and soaking in the beauty of all it offers.  I myself, found myself going in circles at some points because the layout seems to promote a "free range" movement rather than a "set paths" style.  The only quirk I have about this place are the hours of operation.  If I'm not mistaken, they close at 5 p.m. all but 1 day of the week, which though seems normal, I find a bit odd considering it is Chicago, which is probably the biggest north-midwest city in the United States in terms of tourism.  At least have extended hours on the weekends!  Overall, if you are visiting Chicago, then this is a must visit site, especially if you enjoy art.  Probably the best value of any deal you'll get at a tourist attraction in the city.
