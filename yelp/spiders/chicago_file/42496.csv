Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Anywhoo, let's get to the meal! Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba has a large interior, but that won't stop them from filling up ASAP. Make sure you make a recommendation a few days in advance at least, otherwise you'll be waiting for a while. But wait! Want to eat a bit early and get your food for cheaper? Try to sit at the bar at any time between 4-6. The tapas are significantly cheaper (I think $3). No idea about the drinks but I'm sure they still have specials.
