Smoque BBQ////What makes this one of the best bbq places in chicago is the variety.  You dont get this type of variety at other bbq places.  Other places might have better items singuarly, but you have to look at the whole when you come here.  Add to that great service, its a no brainer.  I just wish they had more seating, because this place deserves it.
