Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I'd heard the food and the atmosphere were great.  I definitely have to agree.  I've now been here about 6 or 7 times and the food is always so good!  I love the bacon wrapped dates, the goat cheese and marinara sauce and the spicy potatoes.  I've actually probably tried everything on the menu and it has all been delicious.  Oh, and the sangria is fantastic!  I prefer just the regular red sangria, but all the different kinds are really good.  You must try the paella.  You should order it in the beginning, because it takes a while to cook....and only order a few portions just to taste, because you will most likely be full by the time you eat all the various tapas.
