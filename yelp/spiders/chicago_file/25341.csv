Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We got the Lou Malnati's Special and added jalapeños and onions. The pizza is really delicious! The crust makes it, its buttery almost like a crunchy biscuit. The sauce is perfect..tangy spicy and sweet! The sausage is flavorful as well. We loved the jalapeños on top they were perfect to cut through the cheesy contents. We got garlic bread which was good and the baked cookie which was a perfect way to end an amazing dinner!
