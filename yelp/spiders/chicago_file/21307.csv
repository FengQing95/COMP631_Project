Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Casual, nice atmosphere...about what you would expect from the typical pizzeria. Pizza was alright, not the best not the worst. The highlight by far was the dessert baked chocolate chip pizza cookie! Fresh baked in a personal pizza sized pan with vanilla ice cream...outstanding!
