Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The food is really good, but the wait and just OKAY service is why I gave it 3 stars. I'd visit again just because the food really is amazing. I love their skillets, and the pancakes are phenomenal. But I'm huge on customer service and if you're working for tips, well... you should always have a pleasant attitude :)
