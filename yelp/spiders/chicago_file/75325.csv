Little Goat Diner////For my meal I ordered the fried chicken. I was expecting a fried chicken like from KFC but way better. Nope I got a weird deep fried chicken. I've had chicken from roscoes and like how they make it so I was not happy with my chicken. I will say that it was moist but it was much too flaky.
