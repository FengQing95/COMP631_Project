Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have never liked deep dished pizza but it almost felt like a crime not to eat it while visiting Chicago. I ordered the personal sized Malnati Chicago Classic (lean sausage, extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce) to go. I figured getting take out would be quicker, but I still waited about 45 minutes for my order. The pizza was scrumptious! It was even better with red pepper flakes.
