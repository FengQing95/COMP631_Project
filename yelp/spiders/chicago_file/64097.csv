Smoque BBQ////If I was on death row, I'd ask for sliced brisket, mac n cheese, and cornbread, from Smoque. Then, I would refuse to die until every last prison guard tasted and confirmed that Smoque is the best place on planet Earth. If someone says they don't like Smoque, give yourself a reason to get on death row. Is that insane? NO. NOT WHEN IT COMES TO SMOQUE. TRUST ME ON THIS. The no-frills environment is perfect because it honestly becomes a spiritual experience between just you and your brisket. If I don't recommend this place to you, chances are I hate you and wish you nothing but horrible BBQ.
