Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The most annoying manager ever, Caitlyn. It's New Years and she put a complete kibosh on any fun festivities. Maybe she should manage an assisted living home home cuz Caitlyn is boring as all get out. It's New Years in the best rated restaurant in Chicago. Sorry Chicago. Caitlyn loses!
