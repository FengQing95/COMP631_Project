Little Goat Diner////Made reservations for a Sunday Morning and we were seated right on time. Great service. Tonkatsu for me. Club for hubby. Chocolate crunch malted pancakes for child #1. Regular pancakes for child #2. Carafe of Mimosas to share. Mac and cheese and smoked fries to share. Tonkatsu sandwich was fantastic. If I could, I would have wanted more of the Asian bbq and less slaw. I had a bite of the crunchy pancakes, and they were good, but rich. Hubby liked his club. The portions were very large, and we wasted the Mac and cheese and fries, which were both very good. If I could order all over again, we would have shared the Tonkatsu sandwich and Mac and cheese so we wouldn't have wasted so much food. The Mac and cheese was good, and very rich. The smoked fries were very good. I would definitely visit again.
