Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Back to the pizza... no seafood on the menu so the classic was in order. All things considered like the packed venue and a game being on, I was happy with the turn around time it took for us to get our large pizza. The buttery crust was good and the ingredients better... but I think its worth checking out their other offerings if given a chance.
