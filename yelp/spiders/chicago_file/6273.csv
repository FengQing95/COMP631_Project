The Purple Pig////Everything else was really good - tuna tartare, the octopus with its delightful green beans, great shrimp dish, and a wonderful ravioletto. Amazing selection of wines including something Croatian with a funky smell which definitely was different. As a seasoned wine drinker, the smell of this wine was weird at first, but with all the amazing food it went down just fine. This is how you discover new things!!
