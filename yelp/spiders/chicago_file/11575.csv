Art Institute of Chicago////There is a lot to see, there is a lot of European art, a smaller collection of American and Japanese art and some other ones. There are a good number of pottery pieces which I was happy about. Two things were a bit annoying. 1. They ask you to check your bag at random. There were a lot of people with bigger bags left in but they asked me to check in mine. (FYI $1. Not sure if you can get it and return it if you need something from it) so maybe take a very small bag to reduce the risk if you don't want to check in things. 2. Some of the displays were very poorly labeled. There were a good number of pieces in one display and no numbers to see which description referred to which piece. Also in a lot of cases the description and the piece were placed far from each other. I wasted a lot of time trying to just match the descriptions to the pieces. Also some pieces were placed too far up out of sight or too far away to see the details.
