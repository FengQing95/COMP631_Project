Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Yummmmmm tapas. Food is good, the atmosphere is fun and inviting, and the brunch on weekends is great. I wish they were open more hours of the day but I love it either way. The staff is polite and put up well with kids. My kids particularly like running around like lunatics dancing to the music playing and it's ok here. It surely wouldn't encourage anyone to try it out but they won't throw you out or make you feel weird that your child isn't behaving. The portions are small and they come out fast so you can order slow and keep ordering until your full. Great for sharing.
