Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It is slightly flakier, while still being just the right level of chewy.  As promised by the waitress, it did bring out the flavor of my pizza very well.  I ordered just an individual sized deep dish of cheese & black olives and it was great.  I'm craving it now, actually!  We also ordered their sample platter with the fried mushrooms, friend zucchini, mozzarella sticks, and fried cheddar cubes (which must be a Midwest thing as I've never seen them before in Cali) and it was really good and very ample as well.  The 3 of us couldn't finish it and our pizzas too.
