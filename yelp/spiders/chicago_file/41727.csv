Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is my go-to restaurant in the city-- I have been many times since I moved to Chi in '06 and have never been disappointed, especially in the FOOD!  I always take my guests here and my boyfriend and I tend to gravitate to Ba-Ba-Reeba for our date nights (doesn't hurt that it's right around the corner)!  5 stars for the food (I love it) 3.5 or 4 for ambiance (can get crowded and a bit loud).  It feels like it's become a little more impersonal lately and that's its main downfall in my eyes.  The staff is always cordial, but it's not quite the same friendly/familiar feel as it was a couple years back.  That will never stop me from coming here or recommending it to others, since I do absolutely love the food!!
