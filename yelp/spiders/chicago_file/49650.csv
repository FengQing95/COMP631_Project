Smoque BBQ////Well I first saw this place on DDD, then met the very nice owner Barry at the NRA Show and my wife and I went that night...NOT a let down in ANY way. It is SO hard to find good BBQ outside of my backyard...(I just don't have the money fo rmy own building) His spices are his deal, and I love that. I use Birch Beer in my sauce, he uses Coke, his beans are THE BEST in the business. The ONLY small problem is the size of his dining room, and I think his ribs are a little flat compared to what I like. So trying to review BBQ for me is hard, cause I like mine so much. I won't review any others except a local over rated establishment in Michigan. Barry does it SO right, cobbler is the best surprise and the Mac n Chee is a model all should try to replicate!
