Art Institute of Chicago////Unfortunately, I did not get to spend as much time in here as I would have liked because I was only in Chicago for two days. I got to see a few of the collections and was blown away by the amount of pieces in here, especially from French artist. Renoir, Toulouse Latrec, Gaugin, Rodin were all represented as well as many others. I have been to the Louvre as well, and you would expect them to be there because of how protective the French are of their artworks. But their loss is America's gain. There are also many great American works like you would expect, foremost being American Gothic by Grant Wood. Nighthawks by Edward Hopper is also here. Will definitely go back to see the other collections.
