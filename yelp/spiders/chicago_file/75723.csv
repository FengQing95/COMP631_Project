Little Goat Diner////I've been here several times and everything including their burgers, to their sausage and gravy, to their pies and everything else is just incredible. I usually give more detailed reviews than this, and if I didn't like it, I would, but just this once, trust me, you won't get a bad meal here. You just won't. I've brought friends from Rome, my boss from South Carolina, and my picky parents and everyone has had an excellent experience. Â
