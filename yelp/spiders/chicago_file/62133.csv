Smoque BBQ////I'm not sure if this place needs any more reviews to prove they are the best bbq place in Chicago. The sliced brisket is the best I've ever had. The meat is so tender and flavorful that no bbq sauce is needed. The Mac and cheese and bread budding are a great combo to this heavenly tasting brisket dish. Enjoy!
