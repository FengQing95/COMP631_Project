Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza was okay. This is my first trip to Chicago and for years I've heard so many things about Chicago  and I wasn't to impressed. We have a Chicago pizzeria in Tucson and it was better than this. However we did get a free pizza cookie  and free ice cream with the meal so 1 extra star for that.
