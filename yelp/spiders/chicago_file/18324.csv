Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I got a personal deep dish "Lou" pizza. It looked a bit small, but like most deep dish pizzas, it was more than it looked. I still regret not getting one for two because it was so good! I decided to close out with Taramisu, which was also fantastic. My waiter, Bobby, was very helpful.
