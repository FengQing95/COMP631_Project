Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Back to my kids', my daughter got her steak the way she wanted it but she said it was underwhelming.  I asked for a piece,  it was tender,  a little bit excessively seasoned but for an expensive place, it tasted like the ones you bought off Omaha steaks.  My son asked for medium rare.  It was dry,  a tad overcooked. In fairness my son is an ass when it came to his steak and would have it sent back.  He liked it rare but since I was having the chops, he agreed to go med rare so I could have some.  That night he wasn't in the mood.  It was 10:30, we were tired and even when I insisted he said never mind on the return.  Suffice to say,  I did not eat my share. I am not the particular one but it was really not good.
