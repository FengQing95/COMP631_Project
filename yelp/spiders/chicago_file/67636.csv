Little Goat Diner////I have found myself here several times. However, I do not find the place to be exceptional, it is just close to my house. Girl and the goat is much better. Yesterday I had eggs which came out looking as if they had come from an elementary cafeteria and shoe string hashbrowns... The hashbrowns were good but nothing was more than average. I apparently will keep going to the place but if something better pops up in the neighborhood I won't be disappointed.
