Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We started with the baked goat cheese which was delicious. For entrees we got the special (broiled halibut), which was equally delicious, as well as the filet which was cooked perfectly. For sides we got the mashed potatoes and special (local tomatoes with vinagrette) which were also excellent. Amie even felt bad that we were having a horrible experience in the city so far, and gave us free dessert.
