Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I went with the fried chicken, as Bavettes' was recently highlighted the dish in an article in Chicago magazine.  Served with a housemade hot sauce and a buttermilk ranch with perfect consistency, the chicken itself was well battered.  The batter itself had a bit of flavor, but it wasn't anything noteworthy.  The meat itself lacked any real flavor, and it was a bit on the dry side.
