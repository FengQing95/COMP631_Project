Little Goat Diner////Absolute favorite brunch place in Chicago. I bring friends and visitors for all occasions. This was the first place my boyfriend and I went when we first came to Chicago together back in 2016. We didn't have a reservation, but we were able to sit along the bar with a view right into the kitchen. As it was the first of many food stops, we chose only a few items on the menu: bacon, sourdough pancakes, and the pork belly pancake to share. While the bacon was proper, the sourdough pancakes were delicious, it was the pork belly pancake that blew our minds! We didn't speak the whole time we ate that dish. Since then, I've been to Little Goat several times. I've deviated from the pork belly pancake twice. Once for the everything-is-everything pancakes and for a breakfast special, both well worth it, but I always go back to the pork belly.
