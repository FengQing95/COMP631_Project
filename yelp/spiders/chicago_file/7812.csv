Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute of Chicago is unquestionably a destination worthy of a special journey (and thus an easy five-star review).  The highlight of the museum is in its European paintings, including the very popular "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte - 1884" by Seurat.  I personally very much enjoyed the Impressionism collection with Monet's "Houses of Parliament, London" and "On the Bank of the Seine, Bennecort."  I also thought the modern art collection had a number of really impressive pieces.  Some other personal highlights throughout the museum were "Market Stall" by Frans Snyders, an African bride and groom wedding ensemble, the Ando Gallery (watch where you are walking!), and "Movement: Boats and Objects, Blue Gray Sea" by John Marin.
