Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The service was quick and the staff cleaned the table as you ate. My standout tapas were the dates (savory sweet surprise), spare ribs (tender!), empanadas (chicken & beef), and octopus. Now maybe because my Bloody Mary was so awesome... their Sangria felt watered down and boring.
