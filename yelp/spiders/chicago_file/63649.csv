Smoque BBQ////While it's not the best BBQ I've ever had, it's the best BBQ I've had in Chicago. This place embarrasses Urban BBQ, which all suburbanites rave about: they don't know BBQ. Smoque, which not only has the nicest staff you've ever meet, has REAL BBQ. The brisket is nice and fatty, carries a thick, black crust, and has a red smoke ring. The dry rub ribs are a unique addition to the Chicago food scene, as people here probably don't even know you can order in such a way. I also love that you can order brisket "chopped" or sliced (for people who enjoy spice, get the candied jalape√±os). My only real complaint is that they don't serve burnt ends, which would be off the hook slow cooked here in their sauce.
