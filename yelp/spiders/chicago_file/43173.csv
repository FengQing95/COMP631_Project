Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Really disappointed with this place. I was here once with colleagues and the food was delicious, service left something be desired but I said I'd give this it the benefit of the doubt and return. I came back with my mom and boyfriend. Our server could not have been ruder, she corrected my mom on her pronunciation of a beer, and our entire table got the impression that she felt we were beneath the place. We also got a really poor table when there were plenty of other, much better seats available.
