Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We started with red wine (who can have steak without?) The Pinot and Malbec were lovely and paired perfectly with the steak frites and filet mignon (cooked to perfection). Even the sides were interesting and flavorful. I never knew a steakhouse could serve broccoli in such an innovative and delicious way!
