The Purple Pig////The last course to arrive was the Pork Belly and tenderloin. Three slices of pork tenderloin topped with carrot strings, radish shavings, and an absolutely wonderful Ginger Carrot sauce - and all sitting atop a bed of almost-candied 1/2 inch slice of pork belly that I will never forget. It was beyond even my grand expectations - Â from the first bite to the last.
