Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Very decent for the price, and we loved that we could leave our name AND our order and explore the surrounding area because they would call us once a table was open! And since we placed our order ahead of time, it was ready about 10 minutes after we sat down. Very spiffy, especially since we showed up on the later end of peak dinner hours.
