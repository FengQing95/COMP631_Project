Little Goat Diner////Peter piper bread? Goat burger? Fat Elvis waffle? Fried pickles? This brunch spot has some real bright spots.  Sure, you can expect to wait upwards of an hour pretty much anytime, but that's what the back bar is for!! Great cappuccino and Bloody Mary.  They rotate in killer beers on tap too (hopslam, zombie dust).
