Smoque BBQ////Now this, my friend, is a top BBQ joint. My girlfriend and I went to Phil's BBQ in San Diego which has 6270 4.5 star Yelp reviews and is hailed as top tier. But that does NOT compare to the caliber of Smoque. From prices to the juicy, beautiful tenderness of their brisket... You will leave satisfied. They're generous with the BBQ sauce so don't be afraid to ask! The brisket is so damn tender you literally don't need a knife to cut it. The baked beans are a must. Their smokey flavor is making my mouth water. I love you Smoque. Thank you.
