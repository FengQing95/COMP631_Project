Little Goat Diner////Huge portions, every thing is super delicious and flavorful and the staff is a pleasure - not to mention awesome bang for buck. I can't even make recommendations because we tried so many things and almost everything was fantastic (garlic mashed potatoes, tempura mashed potatoes, tuna melt, chocolate chip pancakes, shrimp and cheesy grits, etc.) Â The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of were the veggie quesadillas - which were just okay. Meat eaters in my party love the goat chili cheese fries, biscuits and gravy, and Los Drowned sammie.
