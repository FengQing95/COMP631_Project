Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Please forgive, It's been a minute and I may be a bit dry on creative writing juices; but the juices of that 42 day dry aged bone-in Ribeye might just propel me into something that is at minimum, a palatable read, and at best, a review worthy of my 5-star rating of Bavette's.
