The Purple Pig////The cornbread and chicharrones were my favorites. I could eat them forever. This restaurant -- both food and service -- lived up to everything I expected. Totally worth the trip out here. While I took a Lyft back to the hotel, some of my colleagues walked around MM for some sightseeing... great area to go for a walk and just check out the beautiful, historic sites!
