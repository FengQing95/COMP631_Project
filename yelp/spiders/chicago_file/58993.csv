Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We started off with the Deviled Egg to get our appetites ready for the other tapas dishes. The beef skewer came. It was flavorful and tender. It paired nicely with the horseradish. My cousin enjoyed it so much she ordered a second skewer. Next we tried the chicken empanada, goat cheese dip, and piri piri chicken. All of these dishes are good. The goat cheese tomato sauce seems to be a fan favorite. You may run out of bread before the dip so be sure to order more bread for $2.
