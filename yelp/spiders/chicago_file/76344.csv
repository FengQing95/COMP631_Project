Little Goat Diner////This place is so over-rated. The prices are too high and the service is terrible. Our waitress didn't bring out two of the things we ordered. And then after our food came out she didn't come back and check on us for over 30 mins. We had to ask for our bill and it was wrong when we got it. I don't think we will be coming back anytime soon. The food was just ok. Nothing special.
