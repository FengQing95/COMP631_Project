Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I got here at 8:30 on a Thursday night and only waited for like 10 minutes unexpectedly. We ordered the malnati's salad and it was pretty darn amazing for a salad. It has everything you want in a salad and it definitely opens your appetite for the pizza so do not pass it up. We ordered two small pizzas for three people (and trust me it is enough bc my boyfriend is an eater and I can definitely scarf down a few slices normally without budging). We got the Malnati and the Lou pizzas. I think maybe because I ate the Malnati's first, I think it tastes better since it was served piping hot. The crust was perfect and so was the layering of hot melted stringy cheese and the sweet, tangy tomato sauce. The Lou had some pretty overpowering spinach that I didn't quite enjoy as much but I guess it is just personal preference. Our server helped make the experience even better by being super friendly and helpful. Come here, you won't regret.
