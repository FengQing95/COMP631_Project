Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Service:  I have to say that from the moment we walked in and until we left we were always treated like a guest in your home.  The waiter in particular was so friendly and knowledgable.  He was not pushing any particular entrees and answered every question in great detail.  Kudos!
