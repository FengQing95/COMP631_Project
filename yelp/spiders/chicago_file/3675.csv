The Purple Pig////Okay, don't miss the fried pig ears ( but you really do not need the fried egg) as the star of the dish are prepared perfectly and the kale and pickled jalape√±o accent perfectly. We also had the salt roasted beets with whipped feta, fried sweet potato polenta with whipped burrata and duck fat poached radish ( at least three diff types) and oh yes, green pea hummus with a poached egg.
