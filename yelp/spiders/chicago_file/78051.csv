Little Goat Diner////I ordered the avocado crumpet over the house-made veggie burger by recommendation of the server. It did not disappoint!! The crumpet reminded me of fried sesame and scallion buns from chinese restaurants. If you look at the picture, you can't even see the crumpet because it's blanketed by generous amounts of avocado and colorful veggies and fresh herbs. Although flavors were predominantly Asian, the "format" of ingredients was certainly a new take for me. One order comes with three crumpets. I was only able to finish one.
