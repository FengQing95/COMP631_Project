Smoque BBQ////I'm Filipino so its an autonomic response to LOVE pork! and this place is a PORK holiday all day every day! I had the sliced brisket sandwich w a side of mac and cheese. It comes w a side of their special bbq sauce, and their mac and cheese has a creme broulee breaded concoction on the surface making the cheese crispy on top but the mac soft in the center w oozing goodness of dairy.
