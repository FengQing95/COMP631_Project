Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I love Chicago style pizza but I live on the west coast so it is near impossible to find. We got their special pizza and it was absolutely delicious. The tomato sauce they use is fresh, the sausage they use as well seasoned, and the cheese they use is piled on thick. The pizza tastes better with every bite and when you get to the end of the pie crust you taste a great butter flavored dough. It is absolutely the best pizza I have had.
