Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My boyfriend and I wanted to stay in Lincoln Park for dinner it had been over a year since I went to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba so we decided to go back. I like tapas and it was pretty good the first time (but try sharing tapas with someone that hates all vegetables... ugh limited choices)
