Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////YUM ALWAYS. The Lou is the best - vegetarian with large tomato slices, spinach, cheeses, and a few more toppings. I'm a meat lover but I always opt for The Lou because it's so good. The brownies that come as a dessert with catered food are AMAZING. I have legit called and asked if I could just order brownies. Fun fact: you can.... if you're looking to feed 12 people. Â Exceptional Chicago-style deep dish.
