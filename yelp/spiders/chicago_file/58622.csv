Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour.
