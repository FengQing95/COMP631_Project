Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////To drink I had red wine by the glass and my wife had non-alcoholic drinks from the bar with amazing cherries.  The first glass of red Cabernet under steak wines wasn't the best and the next one below was much better.  Thank you Brandon for the birthday present on the first.
