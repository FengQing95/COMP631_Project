Little Goat Diner////I realize that most of my complaints would be ridiculous if I had gone at a peak time with 100 customers in there, but that simply was not the case.  In sum, this is a great place to sit and drink and snack, assuming you can find a place to sit.  The impressive selection of craft beer, cider, and regional soda alone makes such a visit worthwhile.  If you want a complete meal, stick to LG next door, which presumably has the same beverage selection.
