Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The bread they bring you is amazing--very hearty and slightly sour with a perfect crust. We had the braised beef short ribs with mashed potatoes, the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, and chorizo wrapped dates. For dessert we ordered the pistachio cake with oranges and the sampler they had at the bottom of the menu. Everything was delicious, especially the desserts...perfect little bites of carefully arranged flavors.
