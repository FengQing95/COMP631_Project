Little Goat Diner////Service was slow. Food was slow but awesome once we got it. Maybe it was just a very busy day, but we got first item right away then waited 20 minutes for the rest. Also waited a long time for check. In the end not terrible but not great if you have somewhere to go definitely need to leave 2 hrs for brunch time.
