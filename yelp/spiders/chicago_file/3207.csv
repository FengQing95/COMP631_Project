The Purple Pig////The broccoli and ricotta gnocchi were fantastic. My favorite was definitely the gnocchi. I especially liked the anchovy vinaigrette and neck bone gravy that accompanied the respective dishes - wonderful sauces! The shoulder was unfortunately a bit dry and the puffed farro was not cooked all the way, so that was a bit disappointing. We lamented later that we should have ordered the bone marrow. The dishes overall have great flavor, although the menu feels like it's doing a lot. Everything from cheeses to panini to crispy pig's ears, pork tongue, house-cured sardines, grilled octopus, blade steak, and turkey leg confit.
