Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Lots of great choices for tapas and delicious sangria! We got the White Peach Sangria which is light and fruity, perfect for a hot summer day. For tapas we got the Goat Cheese Baked in Tomato Sauce, Fried Green Peppers, Grilled Hanger Steak, and Pork Shoulder Paella. The paella was my favorite dish and I'd highly recommend it!! The goat cheese baked in tomato sauce was also very good!
