Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////LA for a wedding & my guy joined me a few days later for the 4th of July and his first real introduction to Chicago. I was looking for a steakhouse for his early birthday dinner. I like this group and we were flying out late Saturday night so decided to take the early reservation and have a great meal before flying out.
