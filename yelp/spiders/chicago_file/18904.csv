Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////You can tell they hand press the crust into the pan.  It has the rustic look with the uneven look all around.  It makes me feel like someone made it for me at home.  We ordered the sausage deep dish pizza.  Yum!  Too bad they don't have one in Cali, but I will most likely be ordering it in the mail.  It was cheaper than Giordano's.  HAHAHA  Sorry, I loved Gio's too but we are living in a economic crisis.  :P
