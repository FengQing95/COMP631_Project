Smoque BBQ////We had Smoque cater our 50 person wedding and every single person said it was the best wedding food they had ever had! Delivery arrived right when we planned and the food stayed hot through the entire buffet time. Their catering office is easy to work with and communication was great through the entire process! We could not be more happy with Smoque Catering or the fact that our wedding food will be talked about for years to come!!
