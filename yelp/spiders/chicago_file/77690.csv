Little Goat Diner////Had a great time here. We actually started going to a different restaurant but the wait for six people was over two hours. We've wanted to try Little Goat and it was just down the block. After putting our name in at the other place, I ran down the street and was told Little Goat could seat us right away. We only had to agree to sit at a communal table, but there were at least four seats between us and the other diners at our table.
