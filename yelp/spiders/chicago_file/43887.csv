Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////So why 3 stars? For a table of five, we were obnoxiously cramped. The table was too small and our seats kept hitting other guests so much to the point that my friend continuously had to turn around and ask the guy to stop bumping her. Plus the menus are ginormous and knocked over a glass of my sangria (pre-drinking, mind you). The size really bothered me for awhile, but I got over it. With that said, I really enjoyed this place. Solid food, good drinks, and made for a great night out. I'd recommend, although there are a few better tapas places to his before Cafe Ba Ba Reeba.
