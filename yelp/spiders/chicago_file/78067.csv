Little Goat Diner////When it comes to diner menu creativity, Little Goat Diner really thinks outside the box. Here you'll find a variety of classic diner foods with a twist. They incorporate unique elements from around the world into classic American diner items. I tried the paratha burrito and the bulls eye French toast. Both were excellent and very substantial.
