Little Goat Diner////Often when I am really hungover or have been stuck inside an elevator all day with a 80 year old woman and her humping yorky I dream of a meal so breakfastly profound you can not only finish it but leave with leftovers no one minds reheating. Enter Little Goat Diner and their laid back "I'm not here to impress you" diner attitude. I've gone 5 times and am just now remembering to review the place. Sometimes I wrestle with quantity over quality vice versa but not here. It is a perfect blend of both, kind of like if your grandma was a top chef and kept filling your plate every time you got even close to 2 slices of French toast left. Simple, elegant, and extravagant all rolled in to one like a pig in a blanket. Also great place for your 250 lb linebacker cousin who plays pro football and can eat a full grown horse in one sitting.
