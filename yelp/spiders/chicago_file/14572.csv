Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As my boyfriend said, "I can't fold it! It's not pizza" But the pizza casserole was delicious. Cheesy, crust was crispy and buttery. If you are looking for real pizza, this is not it. But I have never had chicago pizza at a chicago pizza place so it is something we had to do.
