Smoque BBQ////Here is my dilemma. The difference between southside and northside ribs.  I love the way northsiders cook their ribs but their bbq sauces always taste weird.  Like they're trying to spice it up by adding too much other crazy stuff.  Southside sauces to me are always sweet with that tangy pop to it and very simple recipes. If I could take the northside ribs and put the southside bbq sauce on them I'd be in heaven.
