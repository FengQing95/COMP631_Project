Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////* Creamed Spinach. This was also tasty, and like the mashed potatoes was not overly greasy/creamy. I have gotten creamed spinach in town in years past, and it is often a testament to the gluttony of American society. While this was plenty flavorful, the dish was not 1000 calories of green cream & cheese. It was good, not over-indulgent, and enjoyable.
