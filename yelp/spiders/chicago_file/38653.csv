Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Lord have mercy, this place deserves every possible star. From the old fashions to the bone marrow to the filet and potatoes, I think I hit some kind of record for most uses of "oh my god" in a single sitting. I really, really wish I lived in Chicago, but also kind of don't because my pant size would increase substantially and my bank account would be overdrawn due to hitting this place up way too often. Did I mention our awesome waiter Joel and the delicious free glass of wine they sometimes give out thanks to their byob corkage fee? I will be back.
