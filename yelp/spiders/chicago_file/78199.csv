Little Goat Diner////Reservations were made, thankfully, because the wait here can be insane.  Despite the word "Diner" in the name, I didn't quite realize just how diner-themed this place would be.  That's not a bad thing, it goes perfectly with her comfort food themed menu, and got me even more excited about the dishes.
