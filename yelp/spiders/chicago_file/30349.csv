Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Glad we didn't waste money on an appetizer.  But don't come if you're wanting to try a slice quickly, they WILL make you wait! And that 1 Hour+ wait can test your patience.  We went on a Saturday night at 10:30 PM and the place looked less than half full and the wait was still an hour, can't imagine waiting if the place was actually busy.
