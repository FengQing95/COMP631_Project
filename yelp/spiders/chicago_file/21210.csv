Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Even though our order was messed up at the counter & were initially charged more, both our server & manager were extremely great about it. They reduced our bill price, still received a larger pizza & the manager brought it out to serve us. Very friendly and apologetic. It wasn't even that big of a deal for us. Very pleased!
