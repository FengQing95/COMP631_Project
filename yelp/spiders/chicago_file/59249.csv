Smoque BBQ////When I go to a bbq joint, I expect it to be a true "meat & threes" place. At Smoque, you can only pick one side and then you have to choke down the free celery salt-induced coleslaw (grody for me because i hate celery). You don't even get free cornbread or johnny cakes! Give a girl her cornbread, fer chrissakes! Â BUT, their are sides are cheap, so paying an additional buck-nineteen or whatever isn't bad at all.
