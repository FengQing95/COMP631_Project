The Purple Pig////I love the atmosphere to this place. It's a very open outgoing casual type of atmosphere. It gets crowded and seating can be a bit tight but the atmosphere is great. I like this place. I want to like it more. I want to try everything on the menu. But it's hard when you can only come here ever so often because there is a wait.
