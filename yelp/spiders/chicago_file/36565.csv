Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Although the food is not cheap, it is not crazy expensive and well worth every penny.  The steak, every cut is always superb and cooked, seasoned and garnished to perfection.  My favorite is the filet.  I was once talked into ordering their burger over a steak and again, was blown away. I have not met a side dish that they offer that I did not thoroughly enjoy.  Although, I think I may be addicted to the elote.  It will change your life.
