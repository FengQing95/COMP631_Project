Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The wait was extremely long. It was about an hour & 10 mins long wait. Upside is you were able to pre-order your food at a cashier & they bring it to you when you sit down on your table but we were able to finesse our way into getting two spots at the bar area. Got our pizza right away and wings too! Pizza was good but it wasn't that great.
