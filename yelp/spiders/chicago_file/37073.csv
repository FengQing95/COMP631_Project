Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Always a great time at Bavette! Dined in the Parlor our second time around -- personally enjoyed it more for a more relaxed atmosphere --a little less hustle and bustle than upstairs. Sourdough bread -good, elotes -goood, Mac and cheese -gooood, cocktails -goooood, steak -gooooooooood!
