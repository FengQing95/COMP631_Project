Little Goat Diner////The pork belly home fries we ordered were super crispy on the outside yet creamy on the inside. The pork belly itself was kind of like thick cut bacon, but with an incredible crunchy texture - I wish they were more generous with their portions! The whole pile was drizzled with tangy, creamy mayo and garnished with parsley and sliced banana peppers.
