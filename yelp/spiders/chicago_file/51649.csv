Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of my Chicago favorites. Been here many times, and every time is just as good as the last. Be sure to pleasure your taste buds with the stuffed dates. They're so freaking good. And for those of you who like alcohol, I mean I do, not sure about you. Their sangria is the bomb! Every single kind. Doesn't matter. They do it right. Normally I don't save room enough for desert here, but was able to this past weekend, and I am so grateful that I did! Be sure to come visit this place, you won't regret it.
