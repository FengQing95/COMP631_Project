Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The place was packed when we arrived, we had joined the waitlist and had to wait 90minutes on a Saturday but that was expected. The food came out really quickly (and they allow you to preorder your deep dish so they can get it cooking which is super smart!) Had appetizers which were delicious but unnecessary as the pizza was so filling!! Really delicious and look forward to visiting again
