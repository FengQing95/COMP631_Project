Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////First, the good:  The food has not disappointed on either visit.  In fact, the bacon wrapped dates were so good and so memorable from last summer that it was the first dish we ordered this time around.  Last summer we had about ten tapas for four people, and, while that wasn't enough food, everything we had was really tasty and worth ordering again.  Last Saturday we had three tapas - bacon wrapped dates, seared scallops, and spinach salad - and we also ordered the "butcher's paella".  All of the tapas were first rate.  The paella - meh, not so good.  The butcher's paella is supposed to have sausage, pork, chicken... our pan had nearly zero chicken and very little non-sausage pork.  As a result, the liquid in the paella had become very greasy and was not very appetizing.  I would definitely try a different paella dish or simply stick to the tapas.
