Smoque BBQ////I've heard so much about this place and it was as good as advertised. The brisket literally melts in your mouth and the sausage was seasoned perfectly. Â We also had the chicken and the ribs, and I would say everything was absolutely delicious. By far, the best bbq place in the Chicago land area.
