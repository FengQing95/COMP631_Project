The Purple Pig////From the minute you step in and are greeted you know you're going to have a pleasant experience. It was a busy night and a bit of a wait so we started at the bar. Matt was a great bartender and the charcuterie was a great way to start the evening. After spending quite some time at the bar we were finally seated so we could order all of the yummy food we saw everyone else enjoying!
