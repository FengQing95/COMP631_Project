Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When the meal ended we were asked if we'd like dessert - and while I still do regret not experiencing the deep dish chocolate chip cookie, I had dinner plans with an old friend at North Pond later in the evening and didn't want to chance it.  All told really enjoyed Lou's and the price can't be beat - were it not for the beverages we'd have likely been out of there under $25 all inclusive.  While I must say I liked Art's Pizza better, the service and style at Malnati's was excellent and it'd be a great place to catch a game with friends.  A long walk back to Millennium Park interrupted by more shopping was a great way to close out the trip with my family and I'm glad we had a chance to try Lou's.  Gino's East or Uno is next.
