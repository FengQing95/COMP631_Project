The Purple Pig////Came here for a birthday celebration and really enjoyed it. For me, 5 stars requires every item to be delicious and worthy of its price point, and the Purple Pig delivers. Everything is thoughtful and creative. The dishes are flavorful, balanced, and elegant. We ordered the smoked pork tongue, roasted bone marrow, pork jowl, crispy pig ears, and summer green beans. Pork tongue was cooked well, with a good bite but still quite tender. I'm a sucker for bone marrow, and this was well balanced with tossed herbs/capers on the accompanying bread. Crispy pig ears were delightful and crispy. The only complaint I had about these was that the pig ears were cut so thing that the pig ears themselves tasted mostly like breading. However, the overall dish was absolutely delicious with the fried kale, pickled peppers, and egg. Green beans were really interesting with hazelnuts, peach, and basil. This somehow all worked, although not sure I'd get it again. The pork jowl was messy and difficult to eat but tasted quite good.
