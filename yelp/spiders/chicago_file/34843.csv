Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Best. BEST. Steakhouse I've been to in years. Honestly, cannot recommend this place enough. So happy we made it here. For appetizer we had the garlic shrimp... To die for! and the freshest shrimp cocktail. Any shrimp is a must! For dinner I had the 6 ounce filet, my husband had the bone in. The meat literally melts in your mouth. The bacon Mac and cheese is phenomenal!! Must try the carrot cake!!! If you can request a waiter, Brandon is sooo nice and John is great. We will definitely be traveling back to Chicago to have Bavette's again!
