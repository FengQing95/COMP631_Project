Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is an amazing pizza place in the heart of downtown Chicago. The service was superb and the waiters always came to check up on you so you don't feel left out even if you say in the back near the corner. The only reason I took a star is because I (personally) felt the crust to be too hard. I'm wondering if that's how all deep dish pizza are like that then I apologize but just not my cup of tea so I took 1 star off. But overall the whole experice was so nice and comfortable . Def recommend!!!!
