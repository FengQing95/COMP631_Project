Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food was decent and the atmosphere was definitely lively.  The lobster paella was horrendous though.  The other tapas (particularly the goat cheese) were really good, but I don't remember what we ordered other than that which says something.  If you are in the area I would recommend stopping in, but there are far better places in the city for tapas.  The atmosphere is really casual and fun before a night out which is probably the best thing about it.
