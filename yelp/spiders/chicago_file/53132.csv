Smoque BBQ////This place was awesome! I was literally sitting on the couch watching DDD waiting for my boyfriend to come home from work when I saw this restaurant.  When he got home, I showed him where we were going to dinner and we were off!! It exceeded every expectation I had! The meat was amazing and the mac and cheese was fabulous.  My best friend is coming into town this weekend and I cannot wait to go back!  Oh and its BYOB
