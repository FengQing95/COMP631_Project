Art Institute of Chicago////The only negative thing about the art museum is that the accessibility and elevators are not intuitive. To access the Impressionists paintings, you have to take an elevator that is kind of hidden. There are elevators for different sections of the museum. On some levels, you can't access the entire level and you have to go back down and take an elevator on the other side of the same level. It's confusing and best to ask someone who works there for assistance, if you don't know your way around.
