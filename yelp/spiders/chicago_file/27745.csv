Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was highly recommended to me as a first time visitor to Chicago. Wait here is not absurd, about 1 hr for me coming in as a solo diner on Friday evening. They're nice enough to take your order ahead of time and also take your number to text you when your table becomes available. They provide you with a link to a website that tells your position, which i thought was very useful. I started at position like 50 something? Not sure how accurate it is as I got seated when my position on the website was at about 10. Anyway, good marker that would allow you to walk around and come back in time. Make sure you do come back in time, they allow you 5 min to show up when your table is called otherwise you forfeit it.
