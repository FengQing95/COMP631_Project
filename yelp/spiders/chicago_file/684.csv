Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Although it was a 20 minute wait, it was worth it.  Best breakfast we had in Chicago. My only observation were the plates with small cups of jelly, butter and syrup.  Seemed a bit wasteful. Everyone had something different and everyone enjoyed the food, coffee and service.
