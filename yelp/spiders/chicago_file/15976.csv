Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Inside was clean, with plenty of tables and booths, walls decorated with jerseys of different sports teams. Â Who cares what it looks like though...as soon as the waiter puts that pizza on your table, you won't notice anything but the flavor sensation bursting in your mouth.
