The Purple Pig////The Purple Pig was everything and more. INCREDIBLE. If you like cheese, swine, and wine, this is the place for you. Every plate I've tried has been outstanding and filled with unique flavors I had not experienced. The menu is also always changing, which is something I both love and hate in a restaurant, simply because sometimes my favorites are taken away.
