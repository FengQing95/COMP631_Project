Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The tables can be a bit tightly placed for some, I gather. A girl pitched a fit when the host brought her over to the table next to us because she'd be too close to us. We had to laugh as she decided nothing in the restaurant was far enough from anyone else and stormed out. Dinner and entertainment, perfect!
