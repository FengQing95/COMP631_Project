Art Institute of Chicago////The museum is currently closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but so many of their pieces are viewable for free on the virtual tour section of their website. What a great way of continuing to enjoy these treasures of history. Some of the pages on the website will give you even more information and background than what you'd get at the museum. And like with the museum, you'll really need more than a whole day.
