Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////John did a fantastic job of explaining multiple options on the menu without forcing any selection upon us.  We decided to order some oysters and he was incredibly knowledgeable about each variety - brine, texture, east vs west - and I have to say the Hama Hama (west coach beach) and Bras D'or (east coast brine) were some of the best we've ever had!  We had even contemplated ordering a lot more, but John suggested that we maybe save them for dessert (wait, never even thought about oysters for dessert!) - because we were going to absolutely love the main course, and the steaks would be very filling - wait, you mean a waiter who cares about our experience and not just over-selling?  Love it!  He even told us the bread was great, but don't stuff ourselves...haha (and it was! could have put away multiple slices of that goodness)
