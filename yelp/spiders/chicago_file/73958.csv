Little Goat Diner////The second time I went for dinner and debated between a burger, the scallion pancake sandwich, and the grilled cheese. Convinced by my server and reviews I've read, I got the grilled cheese. I'm not exactly a grilled cheese fanatic, but I appreciate a good grilled cheese. This was a very good grilled cheese. The bacon Gouda bread was incredible and the filling of apple-tomato was the filling I didn't know I wanted in a grilled cheese. I'm not sure if I can go back to regular grilled cheeses now that I've had one with bacon Gouda bread.
