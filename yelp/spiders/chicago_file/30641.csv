Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It was raining and way too cold for our tastes so we decided to get delivery. I was a bit concerned about how the delivery trip would impact the pie. It arrived at our room PERFECT! We were advised to order a small for 2 adults and it was the perfect amount. We had the pepperoni and lean sausage pie and it was beyond good. I almost never eat pizza and at alllllllllll of my share. Â
