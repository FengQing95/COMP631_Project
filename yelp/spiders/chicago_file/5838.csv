The Purple Pig////We were looking for a small snack before dinner so we went with the fried manchego and the duck. We were in for a shock when the waiter brought out a HUGE plate and buns for the duck. There was no dinner for us that night! The 1/2 duck was a large portion definitely meant for 2 or more. If only I had taken a picture to show just how big it was! It came with hot buttery buns that you were meant to put pieces of duck and yogurt in. The duck itself was so tender, juicy, and flavorful. It practically melts in your mouth. The outside is so crispy, it likely traps all the juice inside. Whether you eat the duck on its own or in the bun, I guarantee that you will never want to stop eating it.
