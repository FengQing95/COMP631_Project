Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Furthermore,  I don't understand how the Patatas Bravas at Tall Boy Taco which is owned by the same company and also happens to be a Mexican Joint rather than a Spanish one can be so much better than the ones here.  The decision the coat them in paprika prior to frying and then do so in such a way to burn the paprika takes away from all the positive notes you can get from the tasty aoili.
