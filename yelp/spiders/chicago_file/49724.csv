Smoque BBQ////Good BBQ. Had the pulled pork and brisket with a side of mac n cheese. The pulled pork was great, the brisket was good but not great, and the mac n cheese was just ok. The inside is small, however, they do get people through the place quick and you don't feel rushed. I thought the bbq sauce could use some work.Still a great place to eat.
