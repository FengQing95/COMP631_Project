Little Goat Diner////Best breakfast food I've had in Chicago.  I come here almost once a week now.  Portions are generous and everything I've ordered has been great.  I stick to their blueberry pancakes or the French toast with fried chicken on top.  I feel a little fat when I leave but oh boy am I happy.
