The Purple Pig////2. The servers are very prompt. Maybe almost too prompt. My friend and I hadn't seen in each other in a while and we were catching up while eating. Apparently we weren't scarfing fast enough for the server/bussers who were at our table every few minutes asking if we were finished with our dishes. NOPE. STILL WORKING ON IT. GIVE IT A REST. I mean, it's nice and I appreciate the attentiveness to a degree but this was bananas. It crossed the line from helpful to "We want you to GTFO." Towards the end my friend and I looked at each other and shared a look that read, "I will destroy them if they ask me if I'm done with this bread one more time." I want to take my time, y'all!
