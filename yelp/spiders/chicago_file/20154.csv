Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered the Lou Malnati's Classic Deep Dish.  I have a big appetite and I could barely get through two small slices.  It's rich, but it's AMAZING.  Perfect blend of sauce, cheese, sausage and dough.  I'm afraid to ever eat another slice of pizza again because it will suffer in comparison to Lou's.
