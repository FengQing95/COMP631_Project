Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Octopus - this dish was a bit of a miss for us. Some of the octopus were cooked very tenderly, while other pieces were extremely burnt and hard. We were also surprised that it came in a bed of oil, which didn't have much flavor but just made the dish very fatty. The potatoes were fine, but also caked in oil and nothing special.
