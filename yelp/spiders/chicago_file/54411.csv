Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////-The seafood paella tastes like fried rice. It's too salty and kind of dry. The seafood flavor isn't incorporated into the paella like it's supposed to be, it feels like they made the rice separately and threw the seafood on top. There are a good number of clams though, so at least they didn't skimp.
