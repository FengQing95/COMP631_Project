Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of my top picks in all of Chicago- delicious spanish inspired tapas and sangrias! Perfect for larger groups as everything is shared plates. Most try the spicy potatoes, bacon wrapped dates, Brussels sprout salad, and breakfast paella! Brunch menu and Bloody Mary bar is also excellent! Â Get reservations a week or so out when possible.
