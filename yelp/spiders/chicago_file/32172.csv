Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Well we walked over a mile and half to get here based on the reviews and it wasn't as good as we thought . Don't get me wrong , it's not bad but it's just regular deep dish pizza and the Italian beef from Portillo sis much better than here . Service is good and the prices are ok .
