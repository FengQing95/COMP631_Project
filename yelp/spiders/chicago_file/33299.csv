Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband and I dined here for my 31st birthday. I was going through the Chicago Magazine's Best Steakhouses of 2013 and decided to gove this a try. We found street parking around the corner, and at first,  it doesn't seem great. The hostess area os a bit strangely located,  and chilly. But when you open the doors to walk in- o.m.g it is beautiful! The ambiance is sooooo romantic. Dim lights,  candlelight tables.  They sat us in a corner booth where my husband sat side by side. Our waiter was so nice- he recommended some sauces with our filet mignon and it was delicious. The sides are big and we split a baked potatoe. We ordered a medium and medium well- we should have stuck to medium for both because it was DELICIOUS. Soft-fall apart in your mouth because it is so tender kinda good! And considering this is a fancy place and we only spent $80, that's not bad! Would definitely recommend!
