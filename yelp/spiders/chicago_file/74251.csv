Little Goat Diner////This was described by my friends as one of the must-visit diners in Chicago, and I wholeheartedly agree that the Little Goat Diner encompassed some of the most unique brunch items I've ever had. For those of you who follow my reviews, I am not a brunch person, no siree, so when I am fronted with a menu consisting of pork belly overlying a bed of crunchy cabbage and scallion pancake, the well-reviewed This little piggy went to China and the meat-inspired milk shake, I was completely hooked. First of all, the establishment has an incredibly cute goat avatar above the building, which certainly adds to the experience. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and helpful and helped us navigate through the menu. My wife and I ordered the two aforementioned meals, as well as the tempura mashed potatoes. I really enjoyed the pork belly dish, although the scallion pancake served more as a thick slab of wrap as opposed to the crunchy, flaky marvels served at most Asian restaurants. My wife loved the Piggy-China-dish, which was a combination of Chinese sausage, scallion biscuits, egg and waffle. The dish relied a bit too much on sesame oil and was just a tad saltier than I had preferred. I did order a small side of the whipped peanut butter spread, only to realize that it was actually flavored butter, but peanut butter. At the end of the day, I'm really glad I came here, and I am excited to try out some of the other popular dishes, such as the Fat Elvis, or the strawberry-fried-chicken waffle or the crazy epic goat burgers.
