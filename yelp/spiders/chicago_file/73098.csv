Little Goat Diner////Brunch this time - you definitely want to make a reservation if you can because that wait got real long after we got our sidewalk table at 10:15AM. Well-made drinks and Asian-inspired food. Filling but not heavy. Friend was pleasantly buzzed after her Bloody Mary and very happy with the okonomiyaki. The pancake came out a wee bit smaller than I was expecting but it was full of good ingredients and drizzled with yummy mayo. I drank the Little Goat Latte (could have been creamier) and maybe a pisco-based tequila sunrise-like drink with soda in lieu of juice? It was delightful but I don't see it on the bar menu online anymore. I also had the chop chae burger set with a goat patty and mmmm I love goat. Patty was less tender than a lamb burger but I liked it that way and they got the mince loose enough to retain juice but not be bad chewy. Glass noodles were cooked just right and it was a wonderfully aromatic dish.
