Smoque BBQ////This is good BBQ. The portions are big and the service was friendly. The sauces were ok, nothing special. I wish they had an Alabama white sauce. I got the chopped brisket which I'm a huge fan of chopped instead of sliced, so kudos to Smoque for offering that. I'm taking off a star because due to their popularity the line was long and the wait was at least 30 minutes just to put in my order and then it was another 10-15 minutes for my order to be ready. I think it would be best to put in an order ahead of time by phone and then pick it up.
