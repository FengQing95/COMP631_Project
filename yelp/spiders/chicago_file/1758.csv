Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////While the wait time is always long, the food here is so worth it. I have never had pancakes that good and their egg dishes are also so so good. The portions are big - you'll definitely have leftovers or enough to split dishes. Would recommend going during the week or checking in on yelp ahead of time because the wait is kinda ridiculous.
