Art Institute of Chicago////It is to the Met what Chicago is to NYC.  Unique, difficult to compare, a little smaller in scale, friendlier, a bit rough around the edges, more "real" and just as interesting in its own way.  The new wing makes coming here a killer work out.  My legs are still crying.  But every room has new wonders.   Free admission for Illinois residents?  Wow.
