The Purple Pig////-Half duck confit: MUST GET. The flavor was amazing due to the sauce (sweet and savory) and the yogurt sauce complimented perfectly along with the fish eggs. The meat was very tender and there was plenty of! The 2 tables next to us ended up ordering it after us as it looked irresistible. *drool* Â
