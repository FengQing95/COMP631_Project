Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My friend wanted to watch a football cotton bowl game and asked the few people at the bar if they minded if they changed the channel to the game he wanted. After confirming no one minded, he proceeded to ask the busy bartender to change the channel and his reply was, "No. I'm watching this." As he was constantly walking around and not watching the tv at all and just told the customer no. One of the managers overheard and didn't question anyone.
