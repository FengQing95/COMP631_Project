Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My boyfriend and I love this restaurant! Our favorite dishes are the dates wrapped in bacon, the baked goat cheese with sauce and garlic bread, the pork belly skewer (yum) and the ribs with the manchego mashed potatoes. Â We ordered a half a pitcher of red sangria for the two of us which was the perfect amount. We also each checked in on Yelp to get a free dessert tapas. We got the chocolate truffle, and the caramelized banana with ice cream which were both delicious! The servers were very attentive, and cleared our plates frequently. We made reservations online for 5:30 and we had no trouble being seated immediately. We also took the train which was a few blocks away, so we could enjoy as much sangria as we wanted. We had so much fun here!
