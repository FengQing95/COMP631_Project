Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When we left, there was a crowd outside the door, so I suspect that may be the norm and we just got lucky.  But, for this pizza, it's worth camping outside like it was Black Friday.  It's that good.  If you want to experience true Chicago pizza, your first stop should be Lou Malnati's.
