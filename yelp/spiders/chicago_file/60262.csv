Smoque BBQ////The portions are plentiful.  The interior is modest with limited seating.  After ordering at the cash register and then finding a seat (if you can), it is well worth the short wait for the delicious meal.  The brisket is really good and so is the pulled pork.  It's all about the sides too though.  They have some of the best mac and cheese and cornbread!  The peach cobbler is good as well.  I went with six friends and all of us walked away very satisfied with our meals and anxious to return again!
