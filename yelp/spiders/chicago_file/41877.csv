Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We had reservations at 8 but got seated at 8:45. Host was nice about it and helped with the overall tab.  Best tapas that I have had. Beef Tenderloin, Mushroom Empanatas, stuffed mushrooms, chicken kabob, tomato sauce with goat cheese were all great.  Sangria was pretty darn good. Service was excellent. Would not have ordered the calamari again.
