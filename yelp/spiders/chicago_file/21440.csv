Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The wait was an hour which was fine because it was a Friday night. Make sure if you're ordering a deep dish, you order while waiting because it takes 40-45 minutes for them to bake it. Overall the food was good but the service was lacking. Very slow in refilling drinks and slow service overall. I'd come back for the food though.
