Art Institute of Chicago////I would definitely suggest making a stop off on the third floor to see the collection of Picasso's. When I was there it seemed like most people congregated around the Monet's (which are wonderful in there own right) on the second floor, leaving the third floor with the Picasso collection fairly deserted.
