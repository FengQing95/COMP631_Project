The Purple Pig////Foie gras w/ Membrillo smear - Also my first time trying foie gras. I liked it smeared onto the bread with the jam over it. It's a very sweet and tangy taste. Probably wouldn't order this dish again though because something about it didn't sit quite right with my palate. My friends really enjoyed it though!
