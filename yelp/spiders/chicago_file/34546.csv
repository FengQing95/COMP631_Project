Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////One of the greatest features of this steakhouse is that you may bring one bottle of wine for every two people in your party. This way, you can avoid the 300% mark-up and enjoy your fine wine at a reasonable price! The only ask Bavette's requires is that for every bottle, you "send a glass" to another table in the restaurant. It's best to send it to someone who also has a bottle where they too need to send a glass. :)
