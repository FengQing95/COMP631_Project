Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The steak I got (Ribeye Chicago Cut) was prepared very very rare, despite me asking for a medium rare. To top it off, the steak was full of muscle and was nearly impossible to chew. It was just such a disappointment and with a steak like that, I would have normally given a restaurant 2 stars. These guys just managed to compensate for it in every other department. The side of corn was spectacular also.
