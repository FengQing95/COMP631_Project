Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is fancy.  You've gotta dress up a bit.  Especially if you're seated on the main floor.  It looks like a Parisian parlor with fancy upholstered furniture.  The kind of furniture Madea probably keeps covered in plastic.  (I assume.  I've never seen a Tyler Perry movie.)
