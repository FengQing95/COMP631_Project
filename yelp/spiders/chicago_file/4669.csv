The Purple Pig////We started our meal with some local beers and the olive appetizer. Oh, em, gee. The olives were warmed/charred with shaved celery, a mustard type sauce and grilled bread. We both were just in awe of how delicious these olives were. We knew right away we were going to love everything on the menu. We had such a hard time choosing what we wanted next. The octopus, the panini, the cheese boards all sounded so heavenly.
