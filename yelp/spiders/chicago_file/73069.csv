Little Goat Diner////I went to Little Goat for brunch yesterday with a couple friends and had an amazing time! We arrived at 1030am and were met with a 75 minute wait. We killed the time by walking to French Market and hanging out for a bit. They have a smart idea of texting people to let them know when it's their time to be seated. So smart and techy! When we got back to Little Goat at 1145, the wait had significantly died down and just a few people were waiting. My advice based on this experience is not to go at 1030 on a Saturday. :)
