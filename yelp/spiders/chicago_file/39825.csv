Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////22oz Dry Aged Bone in Ribeye - Dry aged steaks are a beautiful thing.  And this one is well aged (42 days).  Most steaks are only 28 days, and it makes a difference for it to be aged longer.  Has a more robust flavor than a regular steak.  This was only seasoned with some salt and that's all it needed.  It was good perfectly on the rare side of medium rare.  5 stars
