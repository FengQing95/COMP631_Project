Little Goat Diner////I had off on a Summer Friday and thought this would be the perfect place to go to skip a wait. We get there right around lunch time and as we requested an outdoor table only had to wait a few minutes. This gave us time to go to the bar and order a drink and right when we got the drink our table was ready. When we got to try our Bloody Mary, it was surprisingly strong and flavorful, so you certainly get the bang for your buck!
