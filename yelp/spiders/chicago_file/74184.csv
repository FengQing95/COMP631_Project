Little Goat Diner////I was SO excited to come here for brunch and get the Little Piggy goes to China (asian fusion sausage biscuit?? Yes, please). The wait was 45 minutes at 8:30 on a Sunday morning (not terrible, but not quite worth it), the atmosphere was noisy and slightly chaotic. The food tasted great, but the smell of fish sauce on my breakfast sandwich was nauseating. The biscuit was amazing and the sausage was good, but the sauce left me wanting. Overall, pretty good but definitely overrated.
