Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Located in Lincoln Park off oh Halsted Street for the last 35 years, Ba Ba Reeba paved the way for a popular row of restaurants, mainly all Lettuce Entertain You, on Halsted St in Lincoln Park. My very smart girlfriend knew that this would be a great restaurant for a larger group (8 of us) to sit at a round table and enjoy a lot of the Tapas. I previously mentioned that I wanted to go here but she said wait for a special occasion with a larger group. Of course she was spot on with this decision as we enjoyed her Birthday dinner @Ba Ba Reeba last night.
