Art Institute of Chicago////You have fascinating artifacts, history, beauty and thoughtful exhibitions. You have brought so much joy to my life that I nick named you "my favorite playground" because when I visit you, I get to play, wonder, and live in other worlds created by art and your curators.  As a major cultural institution renounced among the best of the best, you do carry an incredible collection and support other artists and communities with such care and dedication which makes you even more darling to my eyes.   I have been a member on and off since I was a young kid.  I never want to miss any of your exhibits and revisit your permanent spaces because each time I do - its like the first time!  I never know what emotions your walls will evoke.
