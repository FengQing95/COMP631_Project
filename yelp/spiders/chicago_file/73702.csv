Little Goat Diner////The frosting on the ooey gooey cinnabun was tasty and cream cheesey but the actual roll was soooo DRY. I have never not eaten the center of a cinnamon roll and yet I did just that and left it on the plate. The cheese crab dip was ok, but not great. It boasted lump crab but I could barely even notice any pieces in it. The "yum" dish was a textural delight. It's a rather small dish and maybe 2/3 of it was eaten. The corned beef hash needed salt, bad! And the weird noodle looking hash browns were undercooked and sooo greasy; they were glistening. The eggs were ok. I ordered over easy but they were over cooked with little yoke to break open. The corned beef was good. It was just sliced like for sandwiches.
