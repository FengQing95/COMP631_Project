Little Goat Diner////I had a difficult time ordering b/c everything on the menu looks worth trying. I love the decor and the diner's laid back atmosphere. When you first go into a new restaurant and smell pertentious ppl, it is a big turn off. But not here. Everyone (hostess, wait staff and our waiter) were very nice and friendly.
