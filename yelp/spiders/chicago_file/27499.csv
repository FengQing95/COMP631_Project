Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Had to try deep dish pizza while in Chicago. We were seated immediately outside, super nice evening. Our server was great! Friendly, helpful, made it an enjoyable experience. Tried chicken wings, delicious! A little crispy, perfect amount of sauce, yum! Also shared a small deep dish pepperoni. Very good. So filling, we only had a slice each. Glad we tried this place.
