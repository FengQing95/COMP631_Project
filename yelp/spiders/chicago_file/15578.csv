Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So we had just arrived in Chicago and it was snowing so we wanted pizza delivered.  The Conrad suggested this place and I'm glad they did.  Is it the best Chicago deep dish I've had no.  Was it great for delivery yes!  They quoted us at an hour and twenty minutes for delivery and it arrived at 45.  It arrived hot and we ate both very quickly.  It's pricey as are most places in Chicago but it is very good if you want a good delivered deep dish pizza!
