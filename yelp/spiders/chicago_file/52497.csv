Smoque BBQ////OK I think the "que" had me thinking this was going to be a higher end restaurant than it was. I for one was very pleasantly surprised! It is reminiscent of southern, no frills restaurants with no frills, just great food. I confess I just had a salad and side of mac and cheese, but my friend had their ribs and fries and vouched for me that they are amazing! The salad was seriously delicious though. Nothing special but the sunflower seeds gave it a fun crunch. It was gigantic and lasted two meals too! I will definitely be back!
