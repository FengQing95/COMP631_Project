Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As early as the checkin for our reservation, things were off to a mediocre start. With a 7:15 reservation we arrived at 7:10 to be told that our table wasn't ready and we should go get drinks at the bar. As soon as our drinks were ordered a hostess approached us to sit down. This was less than five minutes after being told we would have to wait. It took the bartender a few minutes to make our drinks as the hostess anxiously waited for us to be done. When we were then seated it was in a corner with many other two tops. (We were in fact so close that we could hear our neighbors conversations verbatim). Once seated our waiter took about fifteen minties to get to us. Thankfully the runners were filling our waters as we waited. It was obvious that we were not his top priority. He attended to our table once for every four times he checked on our neighbors. It was one of the worst waitstaff experiences I've ever had in Chicago.
