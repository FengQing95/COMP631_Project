Little Goat Diner////Came here for lunch on a weekday, and had a short 5-10 minute wait for our party of 3. Service was fast and friendly. We were feeling brunchy, so I got the paratha burrito (indian flatbread with sunny side up eggs inside, a salad mix on top, and a delicious sauce on the side. My sister got the bulls eye french toast which was phenomenal! I loved loved loved how the chicken was good. It was the perfect texture, and the breading on the outside was nice and crispy, with a sweet flavor to it. I also go the chocolate malt milkshake which was seriously Â delicious and topped with fresh whipped cream. I would definitely come here again to explore some more menu options.
