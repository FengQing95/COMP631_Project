Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Well..... I really wanted to like this pizza & their famous butter crust but I didn't. The crust wasn't soft but crunchy & firm, with no desire to eat the ends of my pizza. I can't even say we waited a long period of time for a table or the service was bad, neither of that. I just didn't particularly like this pizza compared to the other great places around town.
