Little Goat Diner////Was not impressed. Came for brunch. The restaurant was crowded, loud, pretentious, and hipstery. The food was meh. The roasted brussels sprouts were just plain terrible, too much fish sauce. The waitress was super nice, gave a great tea recommendation. She was attentive and the food came out in a timely manner. Overall we were very disappointed, and even cancelled our reservation at Girl and the Goat because of it.
