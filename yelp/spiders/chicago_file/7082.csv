Art Institute of Chicago////I visited it. and let me say the place is amazing and the art work, how ever the people running the place not so great, the staff personal were just awful, they seem to not like where there working, hey we all been there Â but they shouldn't bring it to work.also there are a lot of snobing up tight people there as well., you can find more of them in the Monroe side of the building. there was even a woman trying to bring in a bag of cupcakes. i mean really is this a ark to bring your food. stupid people. anyways the building is nice but the way things are run in that place, not so great.
