Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////A special thanks to Eric for helping design one of the best meals I've ever had, and to Johnny our top flight waiter who provided a flawless service and great personality along the way.  Also to the rest of the team we didn't see who made such a memorable night.  My wife and I are very thankful!  Cheers!
