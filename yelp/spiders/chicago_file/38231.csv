Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I'm leaving a four star because while the food didn't come out quite right, the service recovery and the empathy the bartender and manager showed was greatly appreciated. Although I left disappointed about not having a steak to my liking, I left thinking I will come back and give them another shot again.
