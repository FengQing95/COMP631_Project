Little Goat Diner////Beyond fabulous.  Delicious, unique, mouth-watering food that's so, so different from any "diner" fare.  Come here for a delicious meal but do expect to wait for a table.  With a reservation, though, you're seated promptly. Prices are fair for what you get and you could come every week and never have the same thing twice.  I'm still dreaming about the smoked-pork-toffee milkshake.  Mmmmmmmm. And definitely get something goat while you're there.
