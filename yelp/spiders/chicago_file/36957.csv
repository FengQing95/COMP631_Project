Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Not sure how our server talked us into dessert without slipping into a food coma but we were well rewarded. The fresh chocolate was warmed and seized the palate to end on a perfect night. I was also surprised with another glass of wine that our server decided I would like with my dessert...and he didn't ask me. Not sure how this guy knew my taste but I couldn't have picked a better pairing if I was given a week in their wine cellar...gobsmacked is the only word that comes to mind.
