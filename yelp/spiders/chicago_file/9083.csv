Art Institute of Chicago////In summary, the Art Institute is a wonderful museum to visit, simply for the experience itself. It has a world-class collection of Impressionist paintings, and decent collections of other pieces. The curators are top-notch, and it shows in their designs. The special exhibitions are somewhat degraded by their commercial orientation. Accessibility to the public has been reduced in recent years, also due to financial interests. The Art Institute is outstanding. I recommend a visit.
