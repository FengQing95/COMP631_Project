Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Amazing anniversary dinner. Steaks were best we have ever had. Ordered bone in ribeye and filet. Garlic mash was also amazing. Don't miss the goat cheese app. Â Service was attentive and very helpful. Our server did not let us order to much. Sat downstairs, which I recommend if wanting a more intimate setting. Overall 5 plus stars.
