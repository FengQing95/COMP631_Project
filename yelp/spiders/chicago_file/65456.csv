Smoque BBQ////Ordered the sliced brisket and pulled pork platter, added sausage and st louis ribs, with side of brisket chili and mac n cheese. Sliced brisket was very lean and a bit dry but everything else was great. Favorite was the pulled pork, which was surprisingly tender. My favorite sauce was the Spicy Memphis. Also really enjoyed the chili. Portion was small.
