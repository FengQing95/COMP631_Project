The Purple Pig////After many recommendations - both Yelp and from friends, my wife & I visited last night. Thankfully, despite the warnings, we walked in and were seated immediately.  We sat inside at a cozy marble topped table for two. They also have an outside area, that's covered and heated - and is much quieter than inside. There was music pumping so conversation was tough - between the music, people speaking loudly to get over the music, and the occasional staff yelling to announce food is ready!
