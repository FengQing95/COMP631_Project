Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I loved the pizza here!  I got the deep dish pizza with jalapeños on it and it was so good!  We got in fairly quickly even though there was a wait.  Our waitress was very sweet and more than happy to help.  I would definitely go again the next time I'm in town.  If you love deep dish pizza, this is the place to go!
