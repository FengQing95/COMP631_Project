Smoque BBQ////I have to admit, from the sound of things I expected a sort of quick sling, four-white-walled bbq diner.  On my first vist I would say that this place is pretty good.  I consider myself knowledgable in the bbq arts and believe that this place is worth frequenting.  I am very happy that this place has opened up so close to me.  The dining room was clean and had some color to it (definitely wasn't as harsh as I was expecting).  The macaroni was awesome, I definitely could've gone for a larger portion but then again it was just a side; the slaw was more salad like than slawish... but was good to me.  The bread they used for the sandwiches was pretty delicious.  Plus there is the choice of fountain drink or canned soda so you're set for either take out or dine-in.  The bathroom was very clean, germaphobes would appreciate it in there.
