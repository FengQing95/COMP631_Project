Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The best steak I've ever eaten in my life is here. And I've eaten at many a Michelin Star restaurant and upscale steakhouse. I only had the petit filet mignon because I can't finish bigger cuts, and it was perfection. It was sooo tender with a perfect seared crust that adds texture to an already perfect piece of meat. I would eat here all the time I lived in Chicago. They make an excellent old fashioned here and have a good whiskey list. I had the baked goat cheese which was just ok, and the mashed potatoes are also just ok. But you're not coming here for anything but that piece of meat, so nothing else matters.
