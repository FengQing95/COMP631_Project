Little Goat Diner////The food was decent, but the portions were quite small and everything seemed a bit bland. Â We only got a chance to try one of the cocktails because when the waitress finally did come back (after we frantically waved her down), she dropped the check on our table and walked away before we could get a word in... I wanted to order something else, but that wasn't an option.
