Art Institute of Chicago////If you don't find something to love in this  museum, then you must really hate art!  My husband and I had a great  time, searching for the top 10 must-see, and then getting lost seeing  other fun pieces. We went to the Monet "Haystacks" and that was  excellent. I am a person who must read every "blurb" and they did not  disappoint. Whoever writes those, did an excellent job describing what  we should be looking for and thinking about. I was very happy with all Covid protections, and the museum was exceedingly clean and family-friendly. I can't wait to go back and see the modern art wing, as we did  not have time for that on this visit.
