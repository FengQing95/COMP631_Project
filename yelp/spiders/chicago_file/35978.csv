Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////- Ribeye Steak: tougher than a New York Strip steak. Lot's of inedible edges of the steak But the worst was the long gristle running through the semi-center of the steak. I had enough discoveries. I kept trying to flag our waiter down but he was working hard. I was pretty much full by the time he came over. I pointed out the problem and he took the plate back to the kitchen in a flash and brought me another steak within 5 - 10 minutes. I would've preferred to have it removed from the bill rather than a new one - I wish he asked. I took the steak home but the reason why you come to a steakhouse is to enjoy the whole experience.
