Smoque BBQ////Everybody raves about Smoque and my sister has been on a barbecue kick so when she was in for a visit we decided to go give it a try.  We knew we'd have to wait in line, we knew it was cold out... we were prepared, except for the guy behind us who didn't understand the concept of personal space and grilled us about all of our favorite barbecue places in the city.  He was visiting from out of state but he'd been to all the big names in Chicago BBQ.  Maybe it was all the talking about Fat Willy's and Smoke Daddy that ultimately led to my mild disappointment.
