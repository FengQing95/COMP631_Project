Little Goat Diner////I came in with very high expectations of LIttle Goat given all the hype, and I did not leave disappointed. It was indeed delicious. We ordered the pork belly pancake, Bull's eye french toast, and a side of brussel sprouts to share and everything was very thoughtfully made. The craftsmanship in the dishes is actually quite stunning: there were two perfectly cooked eggs embedded within the french toast, which totally took me by surprise as I was cutting into it. The pork belly pancake was also very good; they were a little skimpy on the pork belly and a little too generous on the asian slaw, but still very good nonetheless. I think it's quite reasonably priced for a celebrity chef joint, definitely worth trying at least once.
