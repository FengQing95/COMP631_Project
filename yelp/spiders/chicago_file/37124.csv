Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is BY FAR the best steakhouse in Chicago. I would definitely suggest making reservation because they are slammed on the weekends. I love the atmosphere here, it's a nice romantic candle lit dinner. The staff has been amazing all times I've been here and the drinks are very consistent. Now onto the steak - when I say this is the best steak house in Chicago, I am not fooling you. I usually get the dry aged rib eye. Amazing. If you're not much of a steak person, I would highly recommend the fried chicken. Even if you are a steak person- try the fried chicken. Seriously.
