Little Goat Diner////After coming here one time, I felt that I need to come back to give The Little Goat another chance. Both food and service were excellent the second time around. My friends and I came on Friday night. We only had to wait thirty minutes for a table for three. I ordered the fish tostadas, which were amazing. My friends had ordered the pork belly with eggs and the sloppy goat, which they both liked very much. Finally, the vanilla milkshake was delicious. Service was excellent this time around. Overall, I would say that depending on what you get and your server for the evening, you can have an okay or an excellent experience. It is definitely worth the time to try this place.
