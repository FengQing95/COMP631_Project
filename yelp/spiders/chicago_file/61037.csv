Smoque BBQ////The best BBQ in Chicago, hands down. I have to honestly say, I never had anything bad tasting from here.  I've tried the ribs, pulled pork, brisket, beans, French fries, corn bread, coleslaw, mac and cheese and peach cobbler all have been outstanding!  Only think I'd change is to make the sitting place bigger by expanding.
