Art Institute of Chicago////The layout makes the place a little difficult to navigate since you have to sometimes go downstairs just to go upstairs somewhere else inside of the building.  However, you will not be disappointed.  Allow at least three hours to see everything even if you're following they museum guide on what to see if you have only an hour.  You will definitely want to see more than just six pieces and even if you didn't it will take you time to figure out where everything is.
