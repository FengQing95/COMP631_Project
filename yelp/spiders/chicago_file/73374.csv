Little Goat Diner////I went here for lunch today and waited about 30 minutes for a table to be ready. Upon receiving the text that a table was ready, the hostess required us to wait an additional 10 minutes until the table was actually ready. When I was finally seated, I waited at my table for another 15 minutes. During this time, no one from the waitstaff approached our table and we decided to leave... Though I'm sure the food is great!
