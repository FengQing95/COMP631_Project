Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This is my go to place for breakfast/brunch! The food is always good and the service is amazing. The only thing that I wish was it was open for longer hours, so that the wait wouldn't be long. However, for the amount of traffic that comes through this place they do a great job of getting you seated as fast as they can. I love the food here! If you have a sweet tooth, they have some amazing choices. The oreos smore and the Wildberry Bliss pancakes are to die for! They also have an option of veggie black bean burger if you are there for lunch. They also have some great choices of lattes. Overall, you will not go wrong here with anything you order. Â It's also close to Millennium Park making it a great spot for tourists.
