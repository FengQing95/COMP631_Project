Little Goat Diner////I have gone here several times to try and find one dish I really like. I LOVE Girl & the Goat, so I thought this should be comparable. Keep in mind I am a vegetarian, so I know that I have limited options. However, every single dish I have eaten here (I have been 5 times for lunch)- my meal has been sub-par. The salads are boring, the egg dishes are bland, and I had the worst veggie Chop-chae I have ever had yesterday. The dishes lack in taste and flavor. Everything is heavy. I usually take a few bites and not much more, and not once has a server asked me if I liked my dish. This place is over-rated. The real Girl & the Goat is amazing, this place is just a fancy looking diner that throws kimchee on meals to try and make it appear better then it is.
