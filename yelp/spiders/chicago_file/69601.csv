Little Goat Diner////One of my favorite brunch spots to date! The staff was so polite and happy to help any customers with any questions. I went with my boyfriend and we couldn't decide on what to order because the menu was so interesting and unique. We ended up getting the smoked grilled cheese, crab dip, french toast topped with crispy fried chicken, strawberries and dowsed in maple syrup (which was by far the best sweet and savory food we have ever eaten) and also cheesy hash browns. The employees knew the menu like the back of their hand and were very helpful in helping us decide what to order! We will definitely be back soon!
