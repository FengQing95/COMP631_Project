Little Goat Diner////I have been to little goat 3 times (waiting for reservations at girl and the goat to arrive...). Luckily the space is super big because it's always busy.  Sometimes you can snag a seat at the bar.  But no worries. Go to the bakery and get some dope treats and some sludgy coffee.
