Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We couldn't decide between the classic pie or the Lou, so our waiter suggested we get the pie half/half, which was awesome as both flavors were different yet equally delicious. The classic is a sausage pie, while the Lou is topped with a blend of veggies. But the real magic was the crust. My, oh my, that cruuuuuuusssssttttttt...
