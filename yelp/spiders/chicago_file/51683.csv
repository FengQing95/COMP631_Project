Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Very few places are as consistently good but I returned twice in the past month and enjoyed good food once again! Service was good, ambiance is fun, but this place rocks because of their food!! Their potatoes are excellent, the goat cheese and toast really good, paella awesome, brussel sprouts salad addictive! Vegetarian friendly and tasty!
