Smoque BBQ////Pretty decent bbq.  I came here with high expectations, so this review may be a bit unfair.  Tried the Sliced Brisket, St Louis Ribs and Texas Sausage.  Thought the ribs were slighty tough, the brisket was intensely smoky and needed more salt or seasoning in the rub, and was hoping for more of a kick from the Texas Sausage.  It was all good but didn't blow my mind.  I'd choose Green Street Smoked Meats or Twin Anchors for best BBQ in Chicago.
