Smoque BBQ////If you get the full brisket sandwich, you can get a combo of chopped and sliced. I am sure sliced is wonderful, but I have yet to try it. The meat has such a good BBQ bark that is fantastic. The mac and cheese is individually baked so you get a wonderful crust on top. However, eat this while hot. The deliciousness is directly correlated with the hotness factor. The slaw is great too - mixed with a vinaigrette rather than mayo. Nice tough Smoque. Â
