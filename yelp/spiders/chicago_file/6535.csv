The Purple Pig////The first dish served was the GRILLED CAULIFLOWER which was excellent, and it probably set my bar of expectations another notch higher from that point forward. The cauliflower was so perfectly cooked that it was soft enough but still maintained a crispy texture. A hint of lemon juice gave it a refreshing dimension. (5 stars)
