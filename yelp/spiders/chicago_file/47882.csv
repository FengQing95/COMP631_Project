Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I'd typically rather have big meals than small bites, but this place completely changed my mind and I sure left with a full belly! We got the spicy potatoes, the short rib, the burratta and the paella. I ate every last bit, it was so good. I would recommend this as a go-to for all visitors of Chicago!
