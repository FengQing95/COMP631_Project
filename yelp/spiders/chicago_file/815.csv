Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////So in total we spent roughly $30 dollars on our NICE lunch get together meal.  The rating was tough on this one as I could be close to giving Wildberry a five star rating.  Well maybe after my next stop at Wildberry I will be bumping up the rating one star.  So if you are downtown in Chicago and looking for a really nice lunch spot, for a really good meal, head over by the Bean, near the Prudential building and stop in at Wildberry.  You will not be disappointed.
