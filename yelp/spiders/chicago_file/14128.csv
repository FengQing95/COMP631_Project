Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First I would like to say this is hands down the best deep dish pizza I have ever had. Fresh ingredients as well as great service in every location I have been to. The sad thing is I have read a few reviews to the contrary. If you are looking to go to a hometown original like Lou Malnati's you do not go looking for a Vegetarian Pizza that was never the intention behind a pizza so vegans get a life. Secondly pizza was not meant to be made fast and on the go so if you are looking for fast pizza with cheap ingredients stick with what you know. Deep Dish is a tradition and a lot of love and hard work goes into the making of these pies. SO for all of you critics that believe Lou's does not deserve a 5 star Â rating spend some time researching Pizza history and learn something or stick to Little Ceasars because it seems to me you have no clue as to what a GREAT PIZZA tastes like. Take some time to appreciate what this family has done and sacrificed over the years to bring you this fantastic pie. Thank You Lou's for making every experience a great one!!!!!!
