Little Goat Diner////Delicious food with a nice twist on the standard fare.  The nachos were excellent, and so was the mac & cheese.  Nice atmosphere, with options for long booths fitting six of us, communal tables and smaller nooks seating two.  Full view of the chefs in the kitchen make for a setting that feels like a classy diner.
