Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We enjoyed the bacon-wrapped shrimp, goat cheese croqueta with lemon gastrique, roasted beet crostini with herbed goat cheese and hazelnuts, spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms, fried green peppers & coarse salt, seared bay scallops, and serrano ham plate as well as two pitchers of sangria -- passion fruit and white peach. This was plenty of food for the three of us and our ticket before tip was only $100. I thought the amount of food for the price was a great deal.
