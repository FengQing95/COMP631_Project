Little Goat Diner////Found this place on Yelp one night when we were hungry. It's a nice place with a cute diner feel. There was a bit of a wait, but we were seated in under 20 mins. The design of the place is unique with family style seating and some booths. The menu is diverse and has many options for those who are looking for a hearty helping. However, the acoustics of the place were absolutely horrible. I could barely hear my friend sitting less than 2 feet away from me. The ceiling is designed where it bounces back all the sound and it is truly overwhelming. I've been to sports bars that were quieter. However, whatever it lacked in ambiance, it made up for in the food. The food was excellent, large portion sizes, and drinks were also good. Two entrees, an appetizer, and a drink were way too much food! We left with take-home boxes with enough for two meals. I recommend this place for hungry students, families, athletes after a game, and just those looking to overload on carbs and fats. Special sauce...mm yes! Try the Horchata with a shot of rum. If you are on a diet or a first date, this is not the place for you!
