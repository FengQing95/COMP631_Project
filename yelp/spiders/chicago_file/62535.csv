Smoque BBQ////This place is amazing! Definitely my boyfriends and mine favorite bbq restaurant in the city hands down. We go here at least twice a month. The food is fantastic I have never not liked anything I've eaten here. I get the chopped brisket platter with fries and Mac and cheese. The mac and cheese is unbelievably delicious I could eat it every day! Definitely a place to try if you're in the city looking for some good food. Also the service is fantastic the people who work here are very friendly and accommodating. Highly recommend this place!
