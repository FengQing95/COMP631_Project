Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Shrimp with garlic olive oil, Roast dates with bacon and apple, the Albondigas, Skewered chicken and chorizo sausage and red sangria. We were skeptical about how good (or bad) this place would be after a failed tapas experience on Friday night somewhere else. Â We were more than delighted here!
