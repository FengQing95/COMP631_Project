Smoque BBQ////I always go for the half and half sandwich of pulled pork and sliced brisket. Its just the perfect combination of heat paradise sandwiched in a bun. The brisket is cooked really slow and it simply melts in your mouth. The sauce has the right mix of tangy, sweet and sour mix that just complements the meat.
