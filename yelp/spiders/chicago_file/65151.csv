Smoque BBQ////Let me say this -- if the hubs was writing this review, it would have been given 10+ stars.  He LOVED this place.  I *liked* it  and can see going back to try some other offerings.  Perhaps the hype and my expectations were too high... or I just regret not getting the Bread Pudding with Bourbon sauce.  Either way, we may give it another shot in the future -- but there are just SO many options in Chicago.
