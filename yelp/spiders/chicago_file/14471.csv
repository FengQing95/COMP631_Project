Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I made it back up to Chi-town for a 6-month internship last year and took everyone I knew to experience a lil Lou's.  Most of them absolutely loved it.  Those that didn't, weren't a huge fan of all the cheese.  But I mean, that is deep dish after all.  So I discredit their opinions, hehe.
