Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I've lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak.
