Smoque BBQ////It was packed when we got there and I'm not used to ordering ahead, so I was looking around like a lost lamb at first and was looking at the big line that was at the door. I finally figured out to just go up to the register and in about 5 minutes or so I had our order and was out the door. When going here after 4pm, this is definitely the way to go, or else you'll be waiting in line like a sucker with everyone else
