Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Everything on the menu sounded tempting but I HAD to try that dry aged ribeye and I believe the fella got the dry aged strip or the classic ribeye. BOTH came out perfectly (when I'm at a proper steak place I always go with the recommended temperature preparation) and were delectable but that dry-aged was oh so worth it for the complexity of flavor. Sides were mashed potatoes and the creamed spinach both wonderful accompaniments to the steaks but totally out shone (as they should have been.) Â The sour dough bread and spreads were also wonderful and helped us keep from getting too terribly sauced on Old Fashioned cocktails (I think we had 2-3 each over the course of the meal!)
