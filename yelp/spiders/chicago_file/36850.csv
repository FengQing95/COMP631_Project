Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The only criticism I have of the menu is that there aren't many smaller cuts to choose from aside from a 6oz filet (which is kind of a drop in the bucket for a dude like me.) Fortunately there was a 16oz New York strip on special that night which was perfect for sharing, seasoned just right, and cooked perfectly at medium. (I am a little disappointed that I didn't think to ask for the marrow, nor was it suggested; I've read great things about it.) We added to that the creamed spinach (creamed with blue cheese, I might add) and the mac & cheese with bacon, both of which were fantastic.
