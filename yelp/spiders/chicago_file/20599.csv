Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They do give you a chance to preorder your pizza while waiting which makes it faster once seated. As we were waiting, we ordered some buffalo wings and I swear they were spectacular. Once seated, our waitress recommended their signature pizza which was tomato, sausage and cheese. Although we would have loved for it to be hotter, the taste was everything we were hoping for.
