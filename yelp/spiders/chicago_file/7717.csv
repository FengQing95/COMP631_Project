Art Institute of Chicago////Un-freaking-believable!  Art on steroids!  My friend and I toured this place for about 4 hours, and honestly we probably rushed through a number of areas because there is just that much to see.  So many amazing pieces I never imagined seeing in person, pieces I had studied in school once upon a time.  Wear comfortable shoes, my feet seriously felt like they were going to fall off, and I was in pretty comfortable boots.
