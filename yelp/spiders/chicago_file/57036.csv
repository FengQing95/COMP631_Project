Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I think that the place is fun and looks great for get together and groups.  The bar also looked to be hopping.  I would go there again, but the not necessarily for the food.  It was fine and really nothing negative to report, but the food was also nothing above and beyond where I would go out of my way just for the food.
