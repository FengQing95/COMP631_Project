Smoque BBQ////A disappointing change from my previous visit a few years ago. Chopped brisket was dry and stringy, not the moist & tender meat I remembered. Also, bbq sauce was not served with it nor available on the tables. Mac & cheese was also dried out and served in a tiny 2 inch portion, just like before. More generous sides of beans and slaw were just OK. Very sad. I can get better food closer to home, although nowhere in Chicago offers the quality and flavor you can get with no trouble in many other states and cities.
