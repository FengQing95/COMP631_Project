Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////While visiting Chicago, the concierge at my hotel recommended Wildberry for breakfast.  When we arrived, we only had a 10 minute wait which I hear is very unusual.  The food was amazing...I had the signature pancakes - I highly recommend.  I will definitely eat there again when in Chicago.  Great food, friendly staff.  **Every day we walked by Wildberry, there was an extremely long wait, so if you stop in, expect to wait for a bit, but trust me...it is worth it.  :)
