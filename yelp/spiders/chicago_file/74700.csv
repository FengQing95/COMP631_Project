Little Goat Diner////We tried to make a reservation several days before Sunday; anything after 8am was full. Sunday is brunch day, also the restaurant convention was in town, that picks up the traffic I am sure. We walked there early and were told that the wait would be 45 minutes. We sat outside in the beautiful weather on a nice bench and watched the al fresco diners eat and saw some interesting food walk past us.
