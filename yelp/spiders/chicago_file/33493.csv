Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////That was,  hands down,  my favorite dinning experience ever.  My steak was flawless, the bone marrow was a delicious addition.  The sweet potato was amazing,  the brown sugar on top was like a crust similar to a crem brule and gave it that little extra "something special". The Lemon Meritage tea was the best tea I've ever drank (i love tea like most people love coffee). The wait staff was on point,  my water was never empty,  the table was always clean.  Our server was friendly and super helpful.  The atmosphere was really pleasant.
