Little Goat Diner////Brakfast burrito was a nice change from the run of the mill tortilla.  The chili sauce had heat as well as rounded flavor. I'm done with the hot sauces that are simply hot and give nothing else to a dish. Simply mask the flavor.  Perhaps in prison or maybe a gulag is a sauce like that necessary  but not in palace like this. Kudos! The hash browns on the other hand were undercooked.  We all make mistakes so the 4 stars stay! the bloody marry a great way to start the day. Made from fresh tomatoes i was told.  More like vodka in my Gazpacho. a pleasant wake up.
