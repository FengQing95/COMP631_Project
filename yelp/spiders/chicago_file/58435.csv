Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I'm a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA.
