The Purple Pig////We had the BEST experience at The Purple Pig! It was myself and three friends and we ordered a number of dishes to share. We really liked every dish we ordered and were assured by our server that we made great choices. We each ranked the dishes we had from best to worst - but even the "worst" was delicious. The tuna tartare was my favorite. My least favorite was the bacon wrapped shrimp, as the shrimp tasted a bit overcooked, but again it was all still delicious! I would definitely recommend this place for those visiting Chicago and wanting a place for tapas!
