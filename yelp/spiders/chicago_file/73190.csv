Little Goat Diner////We sampled a variety of things from the menu, even the non breakfast ones. Such as the Smoke Pork and Toffee Milkshake. For those who think this sounds weird... there isn't actually chunks of pork in it, and the toffee sort of overwhelms the taste and texture of the shake. The smoked pork is more of a subtle thing. It was yummy, though not as unique as I had hoped but definitely packs a lot of toffee.
