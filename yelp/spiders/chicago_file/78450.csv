Little Goat Diner////Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server's recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly.
