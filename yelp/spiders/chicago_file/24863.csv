Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've been to three of their locations. My favorite for ambiance is the one on Touhy, but for convenience and efficient service, I like the Lincoln Sq. location. The one on Wrightwood is TOO small and didn't serve all the items from the Touhy location, but that was a while back.
