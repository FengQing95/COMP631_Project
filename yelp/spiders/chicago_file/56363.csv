Smoque BBQ////I LOVE this place! The food is amazing and the portions are just  the right size. I go here every time  I'm in Chicago. My favorite thing to order is the chopped brisket platter w/ beans,coleslaw and peach cobbler. Staff is friendly and tables are clean. Parking can be difficult. I like this place over other Chicago BBQ places.
