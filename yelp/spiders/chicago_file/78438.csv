Little Goat Diner////Little Piggy Went To China was my favorite dish and it really stands out. Runny yoke dripping down Sichuan pork patties, crumbly crumpets, with a wonderful sauce that's amazing in taste, salty, sweet, spicy, tangy and magical umami. Just look at the ingredients and imagine the explosion of flavors: sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, gooseberries!
