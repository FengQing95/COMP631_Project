Smoque BBQ////This place is legit.   I can`t claim to be a BBQ connoisseur, but I experienced some good Q when I was in Texas and this place is at least on par with the great joints down there.  Nice sized portions, great flavor, and the meat is cooked just right.   If not for the wait, I`d probably give it 5 stars.
