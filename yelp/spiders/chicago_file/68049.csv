Little Goat Diner////One of our favorite spots to go on the weekends. Usually hit up the bakery/bar side and get iced coffee and a muffin, along with a toasted bagel with either the sweet onion spread or honey Marsala spread. If sitting down and not bringing home you can't go wrong with a number of their dishes / my favorites include bisquits and gravy for brunch or their sloppy goat sandwich for lunch. Delicious and great atmosphere, generally hopping.
