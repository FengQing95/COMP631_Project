Smoque BBQ////-Kansas City at one time acted as my second home.  Whenever in town I would eat BBQ for lunch and dinner...not a gross exaggeration - well, it's gross...but not really.  I love meat, kiddos!  I've sampled Arthur Bryant, OK Joe's (My favorite - the Z Man sandwich OMG - is this what heaven is like?), Gates...and so on.
