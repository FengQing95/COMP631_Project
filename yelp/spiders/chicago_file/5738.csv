The Purple Pig////Reviewing as someone who doesn't eat meat. I recently stopped eating meat but wanted to try this place because of all the amazing recommendations from friends. My friends did however order the meat dishes so I will pass on their reviews for it too. I enjoyed all of the dishes we chose! Mushrooms 3 ways was basically 3 diff types of mushroom made differently in one dish. It was a grilled mushroom topped with some type of truffle purée and a cold pickled radish/mushroom salad on top of that! Next best was the ravioli. It's just one ravioli and the cheese was so creamy! This dish is very flavorful with truffle all over. The cauliflower was a basic dish but definitely not bad. I was basically eating bougie veggies here  now for the meat: One of my friends ordered the turkey leg and I think that was the best thing at this restaurant. I tried a small piece of it and it was so tender and slid right off the bone, not to mention the sauce that was all over it, really made it delicious. Another friend tried the bone marrow and said it was amazing and one of the best bone marrow he has ever tried. They also ordered the grilled octopus and orecchiette which looked really tasty! We ate everything we ordered and were all really satisfied with our meal.
