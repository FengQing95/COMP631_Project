Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I dined at this restaurant twice the week I was in Chicago for business. On my first visit, I had the 9" Malnati Chicago Classic, which was recommended by the bartender. It took a while to prepare, however the wait was worth it. The pizza was tasty, the gooey cheese stayed on the slices, and the top sausage layer was thick flavorful, not spicy. The thick Buttercrust was delicious and had a perfect light-crunch consistency. Also, you can really appreciate the fresh tomato sauce. I ordered the pizza with a small house salad w/ the House Red Wine Vinaigrette dressing on the side. A very good salad dressing.
