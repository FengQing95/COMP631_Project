Art Institute of Chicago////The museum was huge!!! So much to see!!! So many pictures I took!!! I really enjoyed the Greek mythology section and the contemporary section...I enjoy Monet so much, I was pleased to see a whole section in the museum....the employees were so friendly and helpful. ..this made the whole experience worth it...
