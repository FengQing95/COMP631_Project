Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////After ordering, they brought large, thick slices of warm sourdough bread accompanied by soft salted butter. We have our share of sourdough in California (we eat regularly at Lawry's) and was expecting to comment on how it's better out West. I was wrong, their sourdough was on par with what we get back home.
