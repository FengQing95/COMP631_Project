Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Everything is amazing. The ambiance is so romantic. There are candles lit everywhereIt's BYO bottle of wine and the corkage fee is sharing a small glass with someone else in the restaurant. It worked out for us tonight we shared and also received a glass! The goat cheese dip is delicious. The steak is cooked to perfection. The filet melts in your mouth. The garlic aioli for the fries is flawless. My water cup was never empty and an empty plate or unused fork was never left on the table. I'm not a seafood person but the platters look beautiful and very fresh. The staff does not rush you in any way to make your dinner go faster. You can take your time and relax. I always finish the meal with carrot cake(even if it's boxed to take home) and it does not disappoint. It's a must if you are in Chicago. Just go!
