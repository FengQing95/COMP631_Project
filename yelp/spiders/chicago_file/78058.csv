Little Goat Diner////Now for the not so great... Because it's so packed, Little Goat Diner has a large section of communal seating, and it's very tempting to take these seats as it decreases your wait time. However, we found that the general atmosphere of the restaurant is super loud, and the mechanics of sitting at a large communal table make it rather difficult to have a coherent conversation with the people in your party sitting across from you. Additionally, we found that though the food was interesting, and cool, the taste really wasn't that great. 4.5/5 for the hype and vibe, 3.5/5 for the food quality.
