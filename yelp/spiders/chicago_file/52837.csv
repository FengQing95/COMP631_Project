Smoque BBQ////Lastly, the service is great. The owners are really friendly and are great at customer service. I ordered the wrong type of ribs and without saying anything- they just saw my husband get up with my food- they came up to us and got me Baby back ribs even though they hadnt made a mistake. They have two sauces if you ask- the usual and spicy.
