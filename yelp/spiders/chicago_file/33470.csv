Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I would say in the past I have had some slight grievances with the bartenders being unhelpful/snooty/slow but it is super dependent on the person and day of the week. Some have been fantastic and some have been awful ( like flat out refusing to muddle my orange and cherry.... I am industry, so I am super polite and acknowledge it is annoying. I am patient as well.) This happened several times over last spring and summer so I do not know if those individuals work there anymore. But even when that happened, the food was so sensational I did not care. I do not want to discount the many times bartenders and servers have been amazing. There was even a time wehn my steak was rare ( not medium as ordered) and they promptly and without question took it back to cook more. The food runners and hostesses are always polite and helpful as well.
