Smoque BBQ////I went to Smoque with a rather large group so I was lucky enough to sample almost everything on the menu! I ordered the brisket platter, which was great. I did use some of the thicker sauce intended for the ribs on it, and it made it even better. Other notables were the baked beans, and peach cobbler. While everything was very good, these two dishes were quite memorable.
