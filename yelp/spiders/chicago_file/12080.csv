Art Institute of Chicago////For lunch, they do have two cafes and a restaurant within the museum; but you can also exit the museum, eat nearby, and then re-enter with your ticket on the same day. No open drinks allowed inside (I chugged my coffee right outside the entrance), but water bottles are fine.
