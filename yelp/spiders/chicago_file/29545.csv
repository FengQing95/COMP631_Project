Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'd highly recommend Lou Malnati's if you wanna try deep dish pizza, there's no need to go to others - which I did and got disappointed. I got my first deep-dish pizza at this place, and it was mind blowing. I ordered the classic flavor and waited for 30 mins. It was totally worth the wait!Their crust is not only crispy but also well seasoned. And the seasoning of the sauce and the richness of the cheese were so amazing.
