Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Drinks: I got the Japanese Old Fashioned and then the Old Overholt Old Fashioned. Both were excellently balanced with a strong pour of whiskey, big square ice cube, 2 cherries, bitters, etc. My wife had the champagne smash, which was a home run (muddled basil, rose and gin poured over ice, with a lemon and orange peel, topped with mint leaves). Our waiter then recommended a green chartreuse smash, which she also loved.
