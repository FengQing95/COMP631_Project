Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My husband took me to Cafe Babareeba for my birthday this year. We were more than pleased with the food, ambiance & wait staff. I must say our waiter Ryan D was spectacular and truly was the best waiter we have had in some time. We plan on returning and requesting Ryan every time.
