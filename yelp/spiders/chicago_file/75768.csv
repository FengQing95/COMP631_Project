Little Goat Diner////Second time I have been to this place and I love, love, love!!  The service is great!  Like everyone there is happy to be there or so it seems.  Great spot and always busy which tells you something about the experience.  They will also text you when your table is ready which is so great so you can walk around the area instead of just waiting.  The portions are huge so if you are like me, and like to try several things, you can share multiple plates with whoever you are dining with.  AND they have a photo booth!!
