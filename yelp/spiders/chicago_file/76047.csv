Little Goat Diner////We came at about 7:30 on a Saturday morning and it was absolutely perfect for my better half, myself and our two little dudes. This was absolutely the time when everybody with kids goes out to eat as the place was pretty well full of families. Our waiter, whose name I can't remember but who was a rockstar, was fantastic with the kiddos and in taking care of us.
