Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Baked Eggs: I am head over hills and in love with their baked eggs. The eggs are covered in cheese,  a tangy sauce and are  perfectly baked.  The tomato bread is seriously some of the best bread I've ever had, and it paired perfectly with the baked eggs. If you enjoy eggs, tomatoes, and cheese, then this dish is for you.
