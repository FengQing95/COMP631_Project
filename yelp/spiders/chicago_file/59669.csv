Smoque BBQ////The food was very good.  We had a sampling of almost everything.  My favorite was the Brisket.  Yummy! I loved the sauce that it came with too.  The pulled pork was also delicious and my boyfriend loved the Baby Back Ribs.  As for the sides, we went classic fries and mac & cheese.  Very good!   We will definitely be back!
