The Purple Pig////I want to have a date with my girl. So I made a reservation for this place. This place was perfect for some romantic date. The place looks elegant. The light was pretty nice because of the chandelier. It's better to go and eat your dinner here. When we came here my girl was impressed by how good this place is. There are some people inside. The only problem you will encounter here is the price of their dish. And also the small amount of their serving of their foods on plate. They have nice and perfect plating. Their customer service was good. The staff and waiter assisted you well. And they help you with everything you need. I'm glad that I chose this restaurant.
