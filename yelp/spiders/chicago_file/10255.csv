Art Institute of Chicago////I am hard wired to love art museums, but I don't get bowled over easily. I had pretty grand expectations heading up those steps past the verdigris lions, and I was not let down. Wow! This place was the absolute highlight of my recent trip to the Second City and the best way I could think of to waste away a Sunday afternoon.
