Smoque BBQ////Also be aware, Smoque BBQ is one of the few spots in town that still haven't opened up their indoor dining rooms yet. You will have to eat outside in their tent setup with no air conditioning. There is no waiter, you order your food at the cashier table and they bring it to you in a grocery basket.
