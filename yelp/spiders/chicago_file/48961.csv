Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////But the BACON MAC and CHEESE dish was the bomb! Wow. I really want some more. Like right now. Like, maybe I can get some this weekend. OMG, it was so good! Next up was the French toast, which was okay, but baked very hard. It was hard to cut through. A mistake was the cheese and potatoes. They arrived cold and bland.
