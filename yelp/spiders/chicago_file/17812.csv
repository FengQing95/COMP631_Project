Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my second Lou Malati's, the first i visited back in 2013 while on business in the Chi. This location was much more inviting and the food was delicious as it always is. Me and my crew had two large pizzas, the Lou and a Pepperoni deep dish. We even ordered the dessert pizza. Note the dessert pizza isnt worth it.
