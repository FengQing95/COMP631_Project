Little Goat Diner////Lunch - Ah... I regret that I did not order a sandwich. The sandwiches here are amazing and delicious (I tried my friends' orders). Instead I got the Springy Shrimp & Pork Belly. It was an Asian inspired dish that was not filling and overall mediocre. In general, when it comes to the lunch items I'm just sticking to the burgers and sandwiches. So even though I did not enjoy my lunch, the reason why I am giving this place 5 stars is because the other dishes are that great.
