Little Goat Diner////So I have followed Little Goat Diner on Instagram for awhile now and I knew my next trip to Chicago would include a visit. OH. MY. WORD ... I am in love with this place. Make a reservation on Open Table to make sure you're one of the lucky ones who do t ha e to wait to enjoy this slice.  I chose my meal based on what I saw passing tables and it wasn't easy to decide. I ended up with Bulls Eye's French toast which was awesome and my daughter went with This Little Piggy Went To China. They were both amazing and out of this world. We shared an order of hash browns that had warm goat cheese in the middle. Who knew it would be that  fantastic! The coffee was even an A+. Our waitress Gillian was also phenomenal.  You can't go wrong here!
