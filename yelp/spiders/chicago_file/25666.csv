Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Being a born and raised New Yorker, I have always been particularly biased with pizza; in my eyes, nothing can beat a delicious NY thin slice! However, I have got to say this pizza is incredibly delicious and flavorful. I would definitely recommend to check out this place if you're heading to Chicago; I will be, again!
