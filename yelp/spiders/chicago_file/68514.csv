Little Goat Diner////It was about an hour wait here which I was cool with. We were able to head over to the bakery and nibble on some bread and Little Goat coffee which I believe was made with goat milk and caramel. The coffee was a bit too milky for me, but sorta tasted like a hot chocolate. We got the concha and a sweet onion bread too. They were both pretty good. The concha had a yummy chocolate filling and wasn't too sweet.
