Little Goat Diner////This diner is worth the trek outside the Loop if you're staying in downtown Chicago, especially if you have a gluten allergy. We couldn't get reservations at the sister restaurant Girl and the Goat so we thought we were "settling" on brunch at the diner instead. The menu is awesome packed with unique brunch items that all look and taste as good as they sound. Perhaps the best surprise was the daily selection of muffins and scones, which on the day we visited included squash, fig newton and gluten free apricot. The gooey cinnabun is also a must-get.
