Smoque BBQ////After hearing all the great things I finally decided to give it a try. First of all let me say the atmosphere could be great it's just always too crowded. I stood in line outside just waiting to get in the place to make an order. I waited so long by the time I finally got to place an order (for take-out) I decided to order everything they made just to be able to try it all and not to have to wait in that line any time soon. They made 2 styles of ribs 1 of which I thought was great and the other I didn't care for. The brisket I didn't care for either. Maybe my expectations were too high, maybe I was too aggravated from standing in line forever, but I wouldn't wait again. I would however give them another chance if I ever saw no line to order.
