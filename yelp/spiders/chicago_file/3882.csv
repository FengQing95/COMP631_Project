The Purple Pig////The server highlighted some menu items and then put in our appetizers requests while we considered the rest of the meal. The one problem was that the menu switched and our server didn't warn us about it. Generally the dinner service menu had more options and very few things were removed - but of course- one of the items I had wanted WAS one that was stopped for dinner service. Oh well.
