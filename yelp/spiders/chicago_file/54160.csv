Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is literally incredible. I had never been to a tapas restaurant before this and it was exceptional and such a fun experience. I loved getting to share the small plates and getting to try a little bit of everything. We had the stuffed mushrooms (which were AMAZING), the brussels sprout salad, olives, and split the veggie paella together because it was huge! You should order the paella early on because it takes about a half hour to prepare. Such a fun experience and a lively atmosphere. You can tell this restaurant is quite popular and for good reason. Everything was sooo tasty and very reasonably priced because if you get a good amount of small plates you can walk out of here very very full. I cannot wait to come back!! My waiter was so kind too & walked us through the entire menu because we had never been there before!
