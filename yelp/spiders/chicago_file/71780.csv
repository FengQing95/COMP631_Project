Little Goat Diner////Excellent diner! Very wonderful vibe! I had the Ruben sandwich it lived up to the expectation and the sauce was wonderful. The sourdough pancakes were a great dessert option as I thought that it was wonderful that they decided to compliment the pancakes with real maple syrup instead of the artificial corn syrup which many of the restaurants serve.
