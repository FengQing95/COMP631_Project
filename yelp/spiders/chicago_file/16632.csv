Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I had a hard time deciding on which Chicago pizza to try on this trip and was tempted by the Lou Malnati's butter crust and sausage-patty style pie. I definitely liked the butter crust, but everything else was kinda mediocre. The tomato sauce wasn't very interesting and the sausage was boring. One thing that I thought was excellent was the spinach salad...especially with all the bacon bits.
