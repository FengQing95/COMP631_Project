Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////a lot of people dislike deep dish because it makes you so full after one slice. I on the other hand like to feel full... like real full. i always eat until the food is right at my chest and if someone were to punch me i'd throw it all up. i LOVE this feeling of feeling full and satisfied.
