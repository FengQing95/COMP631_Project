Smoque BBQ////I would never lick my fingers at Smoque.  There are too many watchful eyes, judging your every move.  Too many people extolling the virtues of barbecue.  People upon people.  Milling about, eating barbecue, checking to make sure your dining experience is all you'd hoped.  At times, awkwardly touching your hunched shoulders.
