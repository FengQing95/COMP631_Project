Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Being a San Franciscan native, I was a little skeptical about trying deep dish pizza. I tried Lou Malnati's deep dish and was instantly hooked. By far the best pizza I've ever had (and I've tried other deep dish in Chicago). I've had it in New York and I very much prefer deep dish over thin crust.
