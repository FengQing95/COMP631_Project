Art Institute of Chicago////Thanks to Free February, I got to spend a blustery Friday exploring as many of the galleries as I could before my mind felt like it was going to explode. I've been to museums all over the country, New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, DC, Boston, etc. and I was rendered speechless by several of the Art Institute's exhibits.
