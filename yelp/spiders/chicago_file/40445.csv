Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I've ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you're looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette's up to the top of your list. And if you're looking to impress me? Invite me along! I'm always ready.
