Art Institute of Chicago////There is a staggering amount of art in this museum. Any kind of art you could want. I've seen several exhibits here, including the Jeff Wall one. Really great stuff. I'm not sure which days are free museum days, but this is definitely a Chicago Institution worth checking out.
