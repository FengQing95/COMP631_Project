The Purple Pig////I can't believe I didn't come here earlier; today was my first day at The Purple Pig. My boyfriend and I ordered the razor clams, milk braised pork shoulder, and pork blade steak. The razor clams came as a salad and it was very refreshing and full of flavor. The pork dishes were savory, juicy, and tender.
