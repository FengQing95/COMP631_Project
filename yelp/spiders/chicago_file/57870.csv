Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ordered a breakfast paella to share for $24. This comes with rice, Spanish sausage, and scrambled egg crust and serves 2-3. Maybe if my friend and I had been hungrier, we could have finished it, but it was a pretty large portion and we probably managed to finish 2/3 of the dish between the two of us. I was a little bit disappointed by the flavor though, as the breakfast paella didn't have the flavor I typically associate with paellas (I think it's the saffron flavor?), and the sausage was super salty. I also wanted more egg in the paella; unless it blended in with the rice, I didn't actually see or taste too much of the egg.
