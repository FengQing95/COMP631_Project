Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Some friends and I started a Food Club where we explore different cuisines once a quarter. Before you think "Wow a food club. how impressive." It's not impressive at all. It's just a group of friends that want to eat, drink and try new places. Our 3rd official club meeting was this past weekend at Cafe Ba Ba Reeba. We made rezzy's for 10 but of course 3 people bailed within 15 minutes of the time we planned to leave. The restaurant was really nice and didn't get huffy when we explained that a few people bailed at the last minute. Our service was phenomenal from start to finish. One thing that I especially appreciated here versus where we went last weekend (Girl and the Goat) is that you can order your tapas 1 at a time, whereas G&G they make you order everything all at once. There is no rush to get you out the door here. In fact, we were there well over 2 hours and the waitress didn't seem bothered by it at all.
