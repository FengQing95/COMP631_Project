Little Goat Diner////I went for breakfast and got the kimchee, bacon, eggs, pancakes asian style breakfast tasty thing. It was pretty damn good. There was so much I took it about half of it home, it was just as good the next day. I like my kimchee with a little more pickle and spice than this had but it was still a great take on korean style kimchee and korean style pancakes. I also had a side of hash browns. It had bits of goat cheese that were nice, a little heavy handed with the oil but still decent overall. I'd definitely go back for to sample something of the lunch or dinner menu, or even breakfast again.
