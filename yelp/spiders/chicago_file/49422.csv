Smoque BBQ////Heard amazing reviews so we tried it out! Lots of options--REALLY good food! Only one weird thing: the bones in the ribs were actually snapping and breaking apart when trying to eat the ribs. It ended up turning the ribs into a sloppy chunky mess because the bones weren't staying intact. Not sure if its because they cook the ribs so long it weakens the bone--but i've never had this happen before and it made it REALLY hard to eat! Not something that would keep me from coming here but it is curious!
