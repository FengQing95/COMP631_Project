Little Goat Diner////I got the goat burger patty melt which was really rich and buttery. Think of a grilled cheese sandwich with toast bread and a burger inside. Filled with carmelized onions and dripping american cheese. It was delicious but I was kind of hoping this came with a pretzel bun. If you are grilled cheese sandwich lover, this might be your dream come true
