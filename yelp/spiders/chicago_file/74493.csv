Little Goat Diner////Food was delicious, portions were oversized (good thing), entree prices were completely reasonable ($12-20ish). I had eaten not long before we got there, so I just had the hot lump crab dip and 2 glasses of the Chandon brut. Oddly, the sparkling wine was served in an orange juice glass... Lol probably my only complaint other than my OCD issues w/ a few crumbs on the booth seat when we sat.
