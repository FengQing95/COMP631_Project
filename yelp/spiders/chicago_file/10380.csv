Art Institute of Chicago////This is a world-class museum, comparable to the likes of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Louvre. The Art Institute is a must-visit for any art lover in Chicago, and has something for everybody. It's such a peaceful place and a good place to spend hours if you need a break from the world. Its rotating exhibits are often really good, and I love stopping by as often as I can (not nearly as often as I'd like to) to check them out, as well as walk through their collections of Islamic textiles, Asian art, Impressionism, and anything else you might imagine.
