Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////You gotta get pizza while you're in Chicago, especially the famous deep dish pizza. The debate between Lou Malnati and Giordano was something I wanted to determine for myself during this trip so I decided to start with Lou Malnati's. Arriving at 6 PM on a Friday night to be greeted by a predictable wait; however it was only for 50 minutes for a party of 5. Not bad considering that there were a ton of people in the waiting area as well as outside. They even warned us that pizzas were going to take 1 hour to cook so you have the option to preorder your pizza before sitting down to expedite the process.
