Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My safe (always ordered, always loved) picks are the bacon wrapped dates (I can eat 4 of these without feeling too guilty bc they are THAT GOOD), spicy potatoes (I've heard them once described them as BBQ potato chips that have been rehydrated and formed back into potatoes), and paella. Â Short ribs w/ manchego mashed potatoes are also pretty amazing.
