Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's Chicago Classic Pizza (sausage) is to die for. First, the crust is buttery and delicious. Then comes the cheese, next a big "brick" of sausage, and finally the freshest tomato sauce ever. The Caesar salad is very good also. It has tomatoes which is different. The shaved Parmesan cheese is tasty.
