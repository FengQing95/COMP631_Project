Little Goat Diner////I stopped in last minute late on a weekday to share dessert with my friends for a birthday. We ordered their Mexican Chocolate cake and it was AMAZING. It has a perfect blend of chocolate, cinnamon, moisture and even a little dab of kick. The service was super friendly and the diner ambiance is super casual. I truly loved it even though I did not have a full meal but I will be back for one for sure!
