Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place has a great atmosphere and pretty courteous service.  It does get very busy so reservations for groups of five or more should be made.      I've tried cafe iberico and upon reading what others have written I agree that this may not be the place for very authentic spanish food, but it does the trick.   Try their chicken curry salad and rib eye with mashed potatoes.  Delish!
