Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////the drinks were just as great as the food.  We started with the passion fruit sangria, which I adored, then ended up getting the pitcher of the black raspberry sangria (I was sadly outvoted).  Both versions were delish but I liked the passion fruit better because it was a little lighter and not as sweet as the raspberry version.  I also will admit a bias to anything resembling a pinot grigio or chardonnay.
