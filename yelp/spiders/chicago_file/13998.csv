Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Tried lots of Chicago style pizza while here, and this one was near the top for me. Near my area it was a take-out only, but oh so good. It's their pie-like crust that really makes it for me, but very fresh toppings and overall just great. Happy they opened a place in Phoenix recently so we can get a similar experience at home (with a Â bit more wait).
