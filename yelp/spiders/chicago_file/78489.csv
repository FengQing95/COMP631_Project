Little Goat Diner////Walked right into Little Got Diner for a quick lunch! And with no wait time (Friday afternoon), the visit was well worth it! Still holding onto hope they'll re-expand their menu in the future. Regardless, the Los Drowned was SO YUM (braised beef, avocado, havarti, & pickled veg --all to be dunked in the braising liquid ). I would go back for this sandwich! --the Fried Chicken Sammie, not so much (kind of one-note; you only taste the hot sauce & the chicken was thin, not juicy )
