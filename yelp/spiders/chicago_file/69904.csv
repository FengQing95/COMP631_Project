Little Goat Diner////I was lucky enough to get invited to the "friends & family night" before the official opening.  My friend knew one of the chefs working so we got to sit right at the bar in front of the line.  It was quite an awesome experience.  The menu is quite interesting with your typical diner fare but with a gourmet and complex twist.  We all had some drinks... gals chose the champagne and boys had some local brews.  The food was pretty darn good... we had some apps to start and each orderd a unique burger.  They ran out of some of the apps we wanted to try which was disappointing but the ones we got were great.  I had the caesar burger which is made on crouton bread with a side of the mac n cheese.  My friend had the asian burger and fries.  The Little Goat coffee was unreal.  I cannot wait to go back and try more!
