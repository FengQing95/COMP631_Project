Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Made a reservation at this place back in January for a March weekend (St. Patrick's Day event weekend in Chicago) and it was well worth it. Though our dinner reservation time wasn't until 10:30 PM, we glad we were still able to make it. This place is a dark place with lit candles at tables, but it was very dark and hard to see anything, especially the menus when your're trying to order.
