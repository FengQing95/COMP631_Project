Smoque BBQ////We didn't realize it was a counter service restaurant, but we ended up liking it.  We got there about 6:45 on a Friday night and were through the line is less than 20 mins.  The line seemed to stay the same length while we were there, but seating was definitely becoming a problem by 7:30.  When we go again we'll definitely aim to get there before 7, and plan for a fairly short meal.  It is BYOB which is nice, especially since beer is perfect for washing down smokey brisket.  The liquor store down the street sold mostly American macrobrews and Polish imports, so my preference would be to bring beer rather than planning to pick it up when you're there.
