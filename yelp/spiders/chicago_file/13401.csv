Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pizza was GREAT.  Went in at about 8PM on a Saturday night and there was a 45 minute wait.  However, we were able to place our order and then they called us when our table was ready.  Within 5 minutes of sitting down, the pizza was delivered to our table, hot & fresh.  The staff was very friendly and the service was quick.  The prices were more than reasonable.  Will definitely go back next time I'm in Chicago.
