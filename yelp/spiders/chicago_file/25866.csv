Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////(quite good) to tide us over. Never once did the hostess or bartender mention we should pre-order our pizza. We were sat at our table and our waitress asked if we'd pre-ordered. Huh?  If that's an option and suggestion, perhaps sharing that upon entering the queue would be appropriate.  Pizza finally arrived about 2 hours after we did (a good hour after we were sat) and...it was COLD! Hah.  Kind of funny.  The flavors were good, the crust was a bit tough but I gather that's a choice...the sausage had a nice flavor but was dry.
