Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was in Chicago only for a week but Lou's was so perfect I returned three times. The butter crust is to die for and the cheese to sauce ratio is perfect. Â Lou's is an absolute Chicago Pizza staple for visitors and residents. Quite frankly the best pizza I've ever had in my entire life. You will not be disappointed that is a promise.
