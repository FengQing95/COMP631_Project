Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is hands down my favorite tapas place in Chicago. The waiters are always super knowledgeable, and the food is soooo good. I always always always get the croquetas and patatas bravas. I haven't tried a dish I didn't like at this place yet, and I try something new every time.
