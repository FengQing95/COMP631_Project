Art Institute of Chicago////Again, this was unplanned and I've been wanting to go here for so long, but I was on a time constraint, and I wouldn't just come and visit and do an expedited tour. It is something to admire on a whole day's visit. Plenty of families came in on this Saturday afternoon, so it was kinda hard to appreciate what I saw with noisy kids, etc. Again, if you have the time, then plan accordingly.
