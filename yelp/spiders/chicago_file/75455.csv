Little Goat Diner////We started with the fries and a side of sriracha mayo - they were great! They were shoestring fries so Michael and I plowed through them. Michael got the breakfast burrito, and I got the corned beef hash. Ah-mah-gah. The corned beef hash....again the hashbrowns were shoestring like spaghetti in a bowl, and the CB was sizzled like bacon crispy. It was de-effing-licious. Michael devoured his omelet raving about how wonderful it was.
