Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This pizza was amazing!! We ordered the classic Lou the crust was perfect: crispy, butter, and held the toppings perfectly. I've tried other pizzas and the crust are soggy. The pricing is great we ordered an appetizer, salad, pasta, pizza and sandwich all for 50. The portions are great! We were stuffed and didn't have room for dessert.
