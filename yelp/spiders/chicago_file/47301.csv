Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of the best Tapas restaurants I've ever been to. The food is awesome especially the dates wrapped bacon. it melts in your mouth and there is a combination between salty and sweet that is just extraordinary. I also drank the sangria. The sangria is really nice as it was not too strong and it was just the right companion for the food. In addition, the paella was also quite good. I rarely like paella as sometimes it was tasteless, but Ba-Ba-Reeba has a really good looking and tasty paella. The service was also really good and the server is really friendly. The price is also just right and it was not too expensive.
