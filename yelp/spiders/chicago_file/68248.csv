Little Goat Diner////We recently hosted a baby shower brunch at the Little Goat private dining space. It was a flawless experience from beginning to end. Patrick originally spearheaded our initial contract negotiations and logistics. Brandi helped setup the day of and the menu. The day of the shower all staff members were amazing. They overlooked every single shower detail. The service and food could honestly have not been any better. David was an excellent event host and took such great care of us. I received many phone calls and emails after the event with compliments. What a great experience! I have referred many friends and I would be happy to host another event at Little Goat.
