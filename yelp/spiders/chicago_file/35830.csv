Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Holy mother of God... this place was AMAZING. The speak-easy environment is so fun, and they have a rule that instead of a corkage fee, you have to share a glass with the table next to you. This definitely promotes the speak-easy vibe. The couple next to us was celebrating their 40th "meeting" anniversary and shared a glass of an AMAZING pinot noir with us, along with wonderful conversation. There's a beautiful bar on the main floor, and then another, smaller, more intimate one down a story. Great wine list, as well!
