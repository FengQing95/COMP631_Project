Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Once we were finally seated we did wait a while for our pizza even though we had preordered it but it was 110% worth the wait! Being that it was my first time ever trying deep dish pizza, I don't have any other pizza to compare it to other than regular pizza and Lou Malnati's is hands down one of the best pizzas I've ever had!
