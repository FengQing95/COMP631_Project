Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I came here with my husband bc of the reviews of a crustless gluten free pizza. My husband isn't celiac, so he can have the regular deep dish. Right away, I went over with the waitress that I am celiac, with intense reactions to gluten and that I have to be so careful with cross contamination. She assured me that they take every precaution and are well versed on celiac. Ok, I ordered the crustless pizza. My husband ordered a deep dish pizza and we let them know that he isn't celiac, but mine needs to be treated like an allergy.
