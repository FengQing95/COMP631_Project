Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This restaurant is a great place for one person, but if you are trying to spend a nice night out with your family or friends this is NOT the place for you. This is because it is so dark in there that you can barely see your own food, and you definitely won't be able to see the person in front of you. The food also is underwhelming for the price. All in all this place is not a great environment unless you are the only person going.
