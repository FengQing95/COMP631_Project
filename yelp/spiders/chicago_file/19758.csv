Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My first deep dish and oh man I loved it. Def let them know in advance as it takes at least 30 minutes for them to prepare a deep dish. Will be coming back for sure even if it's only an hour stay in Chicago. The service was kinda slow as well but the food dominated everything.
