Little Goat Diner////I do not understand the rave reviews this restaurant receives on an ongoing basis.  The lunch is also sub par in comparison to most places in the area.   The only bigger rip-off in the area for breakfast is Meli Cafe.   We now go to Johnnies down the street where we can get a well cooked egg for $6.  Skip this place on the weekends too because for the money you can have brunch at Avec, Sepia, The Publican and several other restaurants in the neighborhood that have far better food.
