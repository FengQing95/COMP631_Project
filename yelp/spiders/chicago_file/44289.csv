Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We started off with the pinxtos, which are little bite size appetizers. My favorite was the goat cheese croquette. It was intoxicating. I think I could go here and those for my entire meal. We also had the scallops, which were unbelievable, the bacon wrapped dates and the dessert pinxtos. Everything was so good, and the service was great. I would definitely suggest trying as much as you can, but you must get the goat cheese croquettes.
