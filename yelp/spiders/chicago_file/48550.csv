Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////As for their dishes, they are pretty good, not the best tapas I've ever had, but some of the best in the city, although I'm sure there's going to be disagreements amongst y'all about who makes the best what. Â I say, go here, check them out, and decide what are the "must haves" for you here.
