Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I got the steak frite ($28) and a side of elote style corn ($7). The steak was yummy and decently priced (considering the restaurant/ general atmosphere). It comes with a cute bucket of tasty fries. The corn was alright. Unique and tasty, but wasn't spot-on for me. There was also complimentary bread and butter. The bread was really soft and warm. :) Probably one of the best I've had haha.
