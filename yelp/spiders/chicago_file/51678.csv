Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Damnnnn dis place is goooooood dinner AND brunch. I've been here for brunch a few years back but this is the first time here for dinner. Me and the boo came here for V-day and we had to make a reservation! We ordered the Papas Bravas, Brussel Sprout Salad, the Grilled Hanger Steak w/ mushrooms, and the Calamari. My favvvv was the potatoes and the salad. The potatoes was the perfect amount of spicy and when it's dripping in that aoili sauce, mhmmmmm. I love. It was also crunchy and soft on the inside all at the same time. The brussel sprout salad was just like any other good af salad, it had cheese hidden here and there and it was a beautiful surprise in my mouth. It was a good dichotomy from the high cholesterol of the rest of the meal. I wouldn't get the calamari again honestly. It wasn't that special from other calamari I've tasted. It was just like meh. I'm not a meat kinda gal so I wasn't into the steak as much but the sauce and seasoning on the mushroom was BEAUTIFUL. I could eat an entire plate of just the mushrooms. Â
