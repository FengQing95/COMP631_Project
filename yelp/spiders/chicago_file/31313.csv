Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Everything was perfection from when I arrived to when I left. The hostesses were all very warm and friendly and offered me a window seat. I ended up moving to the bar (where you have to be 21+ and they ID you if you look under 40) so that I could charge my phone. My waiter, Calvin, provided great service and made sure to check in on me the right amount but not too much. Â He was clear about things like coke zero coming from a bottle and the possible wait time for deep dish pizza. I opted for a calamari appetizer which came fast and was very good. The calamari is rings only (no tentacles) and was crispy without too much breading. My personal Lou Malnati's classic was actually more food than I anticipated and after the appetizer, only managed to eat half. It may be that I've only ever had Lou Malnati's for takeout, but having it fresh in the restaurant was the best I'd ever had it. Can't wait to be back!
