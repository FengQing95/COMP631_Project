Little Goat Diner////Having the bread/coffee shop as an attachment is a huge benefit for this spot. We got there during a relatively busy time, so we were able to stop in the coffee shop for an americano and hang out until our table was ready. Once we sat, we were helped right away and our server was great. It was really a top notch experience from start to finish.
