Little Goat Diner////Very tasty and unique food, with different flavor combos than I'm used to (in a good way). I've found that I've loved some dishes more than others, but the food is always interesting, and often has a sweet and sour element (or perhaps that's just what I've been ordering?). The diner is often quite busy, so be prepared to wait.
