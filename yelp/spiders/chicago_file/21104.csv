Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Picked up The Lou. Spinach, 3 cheeses, garlic, and tomatoes. Was a great deep dish pizza. My first in Chicago and first ever. I was referred here by a long time friend and the restaurant and food did not disappoint. I suggest doing online orders as this place was jam packed inside and outside with people all over. Will be sure to come here for my pizza when in town, that's for sure! Great place for the family.
