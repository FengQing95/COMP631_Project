Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////A few coworkers and I recently dined here. There was a variety of tapas, and they were all good quality. Things were seasoned nicely but I wouldn't say that any of them made us feel that it was the greatest thing ever. The ambiance of the restaurant was great and the server was very attentive and friendly. Things were also affordable and fast. These factors alone make us a "fan" of Ba-Ba-Reeba.
