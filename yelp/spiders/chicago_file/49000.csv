Smoque BBQ////This has to be some of THE BEST bar b que we have ever had here in the Chicagoland area!!!! The ribs are excellent. My father and I were first timers so we sampled most off the menu.... Ribs: First rate. Seasoned perfectly, falls off the bone and meaty. Texas sausage good, pulled pork ok, brisket good, macaroni awesome, fries great, cole slaw great, the sause great. We were serverd quickly even though it was very busy on a Saturday. Service was excellent. All in all an AWESOME dining experience. Definitly going to roll out there again.....
