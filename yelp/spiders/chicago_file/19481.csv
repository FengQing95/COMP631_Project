Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Had the deep dish pizza and it was okay. Not really a fan of theirs or giordanos, but when in Chicago... The customer service was great! We ordered half cheese half sausage and they accidentally gave us all sausage, so our waiter didn't make us pay for it. We didn't even ask for that or complain at all, they just offered to not make us pay the bill. It was super nice of them, id def go back (but order something other than the deep dish) not my thing lol
