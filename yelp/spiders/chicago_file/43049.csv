Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have a severe food allergy to anything containing cow's milk. As such it's a pain to eat out for me most of the time and while I was going to be in Chicago for the day with a friend we really wanted to eat someplace nice. So I contacted Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba ahead of time via e-mail with my concerns and got a reply within 10 minutes from one of the owners; who said that he'd have the executive chef e-mail me back later that day when he was available. Needless to say, they were able to handle my concerns easily.
