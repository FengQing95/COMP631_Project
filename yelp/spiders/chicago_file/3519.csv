The Purple Pig////Come with a bunch of people as everything is tapas style and better enjoyed when shared. Order a little bit of everything from each section of their menu to get the full experience. We got the crispy pig ears with kale (I would have had no idea I was eating pig ears if I hadn't read the menu, try it!), a seafood dish (delicious sauce to dip bread in), the roasted bone marrow (so yum), and a roasted beet salad with a creamy goat cheese that was pretty perfect.
