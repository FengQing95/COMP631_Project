Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I normally steer away from steak places like Flemings etc as most of the time I can make the steak better at home on my Weber.  That is not the case here.  This was hands down the BEST steak I have ever had.  I love the fact that they give you special salt to put on your steak if you want.  The sourdough bread is tremendously awesome....best bread i have ever had.  The baked goat cheese was decent not memorable.  The baked potato was awesome, the bacon here is unique, we would come back to order the bacon all on its own.  We had the gold brick sundae with the malt whiskey ice cream for dessert which was also just okay.  five stars for the steak, potatoes and bacon, four stars for the dessert and goat cheese...
