Smoque BBQ////Going to Smoque for BBQ is like going to the south side for blues. As a white, middle class suburban kid, this is an adventure! Fortunately, they're about 6 inches off of the Kennedy on Pulaski, so that's lowers the anxiety a bit. But then you pull in and the street seems full of signs that basically say, "If you're a Smoque customer, don't even THINK of parking here!" In fact, I think some of the signs said EXACTLY that. But after a bit of roaming around, we found a parking spot that didn't appear to have a "TOW ZONE" sign in effect -- at that moment.
