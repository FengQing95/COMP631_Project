Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Definitely not your traditional steakhouse, what a great experience this restaurant was. From the music and decor that remind you of the old Jazz age, to the delicious food, this place is a must visit. If you love a good crab cake, they have the ultimate crab cake!! The chocolate pie which they are known for is amazing!
