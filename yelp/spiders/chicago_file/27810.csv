Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First of all, it's nice that even when it's busy inside, they let you order before you get a table because of the long cooking times for the pizzas. Secondly, they told us that we would have a long wait time however we did not experience that. We got there during the dinner rush on a Saturday night and we waited 15 minutes when they said it would be 45.
