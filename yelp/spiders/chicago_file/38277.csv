Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I had no idea how blown away I would be by the food and experience at Bavette's. The atmosphere is so energetic and alive, but not so loud that it can't be intimate at the same time. The entire staff is so friendly, and explained the history and chemistry behind their drinks. The bread oh the bread, crusty outside, and the inside is like no bread I have ever had, it's dense but not heavy and creamy and moist. And then the steak, I was floored. Cooked perfectly, melt in your mouth with a hint of the salty rub they use, can't even describe the flavor! How I wish we would have had room for dessert! I can't wait to go back here, I am going to be dreaming of this meal for a long long time.
