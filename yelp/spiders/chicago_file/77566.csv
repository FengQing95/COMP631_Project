Little Goat Diner////Menu looks like a best of greatest hits of comfort food. If the other dishes are anywhere near as good as it reads or the nachos well,  it's time to pack a bowl and strap on the old feed bag.   Damn,  I regret my limited appetite as I wish I had ordered the patty melt, or the goat chili, or the cheese fries, or the pot pie, or the blue plate special.
