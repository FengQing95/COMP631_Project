Little Goat Diner////My favorite was definitely my Parathas Burrito! Talk about creativity.  There were so many flavors going on it this dish-- from carb-y comforting paratha as the wrap, salty goat milk cheddar inside to the light, tangy vinaigrette over the top.  It was wonderful-- very filling without being grossly heavy.  I would definitely order this one again! The Los Drowned was out this world too-- super rich and heavy, kind of like a beef stew on bread.  I would recommend a side salad with this one to lighten things up.  The tempura mashed potatoes were nice-- exactly what you would expect it to taste like.  Crispy and light on the outside but smooth and creamy on the inside.  The only thing I was a little underwhelmed by were the goat chili cheese fries-- but even then, I would still eat it again.  The goat chili and the cheese topping were delicious, but the fries were nothing too special and I found them a bit too crunchy.  Next time I would rather get a bowl of the goat chili on it's own!
