Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Loved the butter crust deep dish pizza!! I went to couple deep dish place in Chicago, and this is the best so far! The butter crust isn't as hard and thick as the regular crust. The desert chocolate pizza with whipped cream was great too! Tasted soft, feel more like a cookie dough with whipped cream!
