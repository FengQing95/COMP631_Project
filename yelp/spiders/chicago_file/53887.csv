Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////It was finally ready and everyone absolutely LOVED everything! We got grilled octopus, spicy potatoes, goat cheese, green peppers, Spanish sausage and the seafood paella! Along with 3 pitchers of sangria and my dad had 2 beers. The manager, Jessica, came over to our table to apologize sincerely for the wait and was so sweet she even took care of the whole bill!! We were taken by surprise and so so so so incredibly appreciative of this kind gesture.
