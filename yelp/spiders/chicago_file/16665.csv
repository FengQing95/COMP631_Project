Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////At first smell, the pizza was already better smelling and better looking than the one with got from Giordano's just two nights prior.  The crust was cooked to perfection - not too soggy and not too thick.  I rarely eat pizza crust but this one was good.  The flavors of the pizza were really good too.  We scarfed it down in no time, leaving no olive behind.
