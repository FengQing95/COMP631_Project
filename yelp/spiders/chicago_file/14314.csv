Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered delivery from this restaurant based on the great dining experience we had last year. The pizza we received was cold, dry and tasteless. The Malnati salad we ordered was good, but the "salami pieces" described on the menu were just what tasted like bacon bits - so disappointed with that as well.
