Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is AH-MAZING and one of my new favorite restaurants. It's got the perfect warm atmosphere for either a romantic dinner or a fun night out with friends. The service is impeccable (hello, byob with sharing) and the food is excellent. Our faves were the caesar salad, shortrib stroganoff, steak, elote corn and the bacon. All of it was so well prepared and decadent. The only thing we weren't fans of was the spinach. It has a bit too much tang with both the blue cheese and onions. But with everything else being so delicious, it wasn't a big deal. Dessert was also phenomenal.
