Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Out of all the deep dish pizza chains, lou's is probably one of the better ones. They have the perfect ratio of toppings and sauce. Not a fan of the ridiculous amounts of cheese like other chains but lou's has a great balance of cheese to sauce. Crust is the most important part of pizza for me and they nailed it with the butter crust. Buttery, crisp and thin, just delightful. Also, was really surprised by the lou's classic. I always get meat on my pizza but the classic was a veggie pizza and didn't expect to have so much flavor. That's definitely my favorite piiza at Lou's.
