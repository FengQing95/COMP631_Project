Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place is phenomenal! We had a 7:30pm reservation on Wednesday night and got there a little early so proceeded to the bar for a drink. The bartender was nice and super knowledgeable on drinks and gave us some good recommendations based on what we like.   At exactly 7:30 we were greeted by the hostess and were seated.
