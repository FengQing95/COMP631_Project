Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We started off with drinks and I ordered the Have A Heart (Martin Miller's gin, Grenadine and Swedish Punsch), which is a great fruity cocktail. They bring out sourdough bread with butter as a starter. For food, we each got the 10 oz traditional filet mignon medium rare and ordered the pommes frites with garlic aioli and truffle mac & cheese to share. The steak was SOOO tender and the absolute PERFECT medium rare - it also came with béarnaise which really complemented the steak. I was a little worried that 10 oz would be too much for me, but I was able to finish it (felt stuffed right after and could only eat a bite of the sides, which were also amazingly decadent). If you're already coming here, you might as well go big or go home. After looking at the dessert menu, we told our server that we didn't want dessert but he brought out complementary salted caramel ice cream with a sparkler on top, which was so sweet of him.
