Smoque BBQ////The Chicken and sliced brisket are always a fail safe choice.  In fact, you can't say you've truly had smoque bbq without even trying them.  It is rare to see smoked chicken served so juicy and tender at other bbq joints.  Smoque has it down to the science.  I can honestly say that I enjoyed the chicken more than the ribs, sausage and both briskets.
