Art Institute of Chicago////Beautiful exhibits with helpful and friendly staff. Great place to dodge the cold and learn something new in downtown. It's a short walk away from Millennium Park, it has interesting rotation exhibits from all around the world, and there is definitely something for everyone. Got through what we wanted to see in a couple of hour's time (all that we had, sadly), but you could have easily spent a half day-a full day in this museum, depending on your interest in art. Would recommend! The membership seems like a lovely thing to have, especially if you like modern and contemporary art.
