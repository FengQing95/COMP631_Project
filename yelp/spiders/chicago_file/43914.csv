Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is one of my favoriate tapas places. I love the variety for both food and sangria. I've tried so many things here before. I think tapas are best experienced with groups of 4. I've had this one great dish, that is similar to paella but comes in this huge black caldran, like some witch's brew. It's delicious, but if there are 4 people, only order 2 servings. It's a lot of food and you want to be able to try other stuff.
