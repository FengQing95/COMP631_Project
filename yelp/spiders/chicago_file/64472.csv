Smoque BBQ////Heard good things for years and didn't disappoint once I finally tried it! Tried the baby back ribs which was a decent, tender, portion with a side of pulled pork. The sauces were delicious, especially the spicy one which is how I like my BBQ. Fries and cornbread were good too, the usual fare.
