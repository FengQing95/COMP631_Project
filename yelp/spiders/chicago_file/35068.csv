Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I walked in with a bouquet of roses from my boyfriend and the hostess immediately offered to take care of them while we dined. We had reservations but our table wasn't quite ready, so we went to the bar for martinis. The host eventually came over to greet us to our table and offered to carry my martini down the stairs to our table. The server brought out complimentary glasses of champagne, surprised us with an additional side when we couldn't choose between the creamed spinach or truffle mac (both amazing) and brought out a celebratory piece of cake with a sparkler. The service here is incredibly intuitive- it's like the entire team really works together to ensure a special and personalized experience. Everything was perfect!
