Little Goat Diner////Ate here on vacation. Our original destination for brunch was closed so we went to the closest place that looked good. It was great! I think my meal was called 3 Little Piggies went to China. So incredible. So much flavor. Everything on the menu was tempting. Everyone in our group was happy with their meals as well.
