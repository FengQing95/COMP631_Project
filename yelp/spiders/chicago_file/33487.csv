Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Delicious! Â It's usually a few weeks wait for reservations so we decided to go when it opened. The bone in rib eye was incredible and my husband's filet was mouth watering too. Very nice atmosphere and our server, Mike, was friendly and accomodating. The broccoli was the tastiest I've had in a long time. Go!
