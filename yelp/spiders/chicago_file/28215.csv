Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Okay, so I've had Lou's before, not at this location last time I was in Chicago like 4 years ago. This location seemed to be super popular and got real busy around lunch time. You go in and out your name down. The wait was about 25 minutes, on a Sunday, for 3 people. You can then actually put in your order as well before you get a table which was nice. Once your table is ready they text you. Overall the logistics worked well.
