Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Consistent and fun place to go with groups.  We've been here plenty of times and always love the food and service.  They manage to create an environment that's family-friendly, date-night worthy, and great for a girls-night dinner.  I would have given 5-stars but I wish the menu changed a little bit more often.  Definitely would recommend restaurant if you want good tapas and cocktails with a lively setting.  Our favorite dishes are the grilled octopus, grilled squid, citrus cured salmon, sea scallops, Spanish potatoes, & the scallop empanadas.  The sangria is good (maybe a little sweet for me but that's just sangria in general)
