Little Goat Diner////Little Goat failed to live up to my expectations, which were admittedly enhanced due to the enormous buzz surrounding it. And ultimately, I have kind of a mixed feeling about the two sections: I really enjoy the coffee bar and bakery section - especially early before crowds on weekends. It's a perfect neighborhood location to read the paper and a down a quick shot of espresso. The bagles/cream cheese are really good too. On the other hand, we recently had breakfast/brunch at the restaurant section which has a great diner look and feel. I ordered the Spanish Omelette, a simple gauge for diner food. For the price and buzz, I was underwhelmed with the overcooked eggs and uninspired pepper/tomato/onion topping. I get that Little Goat supposed to be a diner, but at least at a real diner the omelette only costs $4.50. I'll definitely go back and try one of the more adventurous dishes at some point, but I really think the omelette should be a soft ball to hit out of the park.
