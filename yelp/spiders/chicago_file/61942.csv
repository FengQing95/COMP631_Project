Smoque BBQ////Everything you get on the menu is good. We've had the pulled pork and brisket, both which have been phenomenal and I've heard the sausage is divine. This place is always crowded, even on a Tuesday night expect to wait in some sort of line. Summer it's out the door and maybe even to the corner. When you get close to the ordering, servers come up to you in line and ask you how many are in your party and reserve one of the tables for you by moving around chairs, etc....which is nice for a fast casual place because it takes the stress out of having good food but nowhere to sit.
