Little Goat Diner////This was my favorite thing pit of the rest.  It doesn't look cheesy or creamy but it really is because the thin sauce oozed to the bottom.  The pasta was soft just as I liked and I enjoyed it very much.  This simple dish was my favorite.  Sometimes I guess it's ok to keep things simple.
