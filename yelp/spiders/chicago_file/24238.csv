Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visiting Chicago and wanted a true deep dish pizza experience. WOW...this pizza is AMAZING! Bar drinks were gooood! And service was great! We went for dinner and the wait time was not as long as they said it might take. The bar was a great place to kill time. I can't wait to visit Chicago again and be back for more!!!
