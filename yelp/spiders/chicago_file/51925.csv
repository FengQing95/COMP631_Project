Smoque BBQ////They serve numerous types of foods, so you have where to choose from. You must also taste their sauce, it is incredible! Another aspect that I particularly liked was the hospitality of the staff. Even though there were a lot of customers, they struggled to satisfy everyone's needs. I went there with several friends, and they helped us find a place where to sit, and they let us know when the food was ready. All employees were nice and polite, and I also have to mention that we didn't wait too much until our order arrived. The prices are affordable and if you like BBQ, you should definitely try this gem.
