The Purple Pig////Pig ears w/ crispy kale - This dish was pretty simple: kale mixed with little strips of fried pig ears, topped with a perfectly cooked fried egg. The pig ears were super crunchy and the texture sort've reminded me of crispy onion strings. This one was just average for me though. All the individual components tasted good, but I didn't think they really married together to create something special.
