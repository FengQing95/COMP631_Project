Little Goat Diner////Although tempted, we did not try the dessert of the day, "Cheez It," but everything on their menu looks and sounded great! The next time we are in Chicago, we do hope to get a reservation for the actual Girl and the Goat restaurant, but if we cannot, we wouldn't mind dining here again.
