Smoque BBQ////What most BBQ places do is make a couple of sauces and then douse everything int he sauce: all the meats, the beans, the sausages. Great if you love the sauce! This place had very unique tastes to all the food. The brisket, ribs, pork, beans, all were unique and that is a new thing to me in the BBQ world. Unfortunately some of them missed the mark - but not by enough  not to come back.  The biggest thing is that everything is a bit too much, except the noble simple coleslaw which is simple and palate cleansing.
