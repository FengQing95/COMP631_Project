Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's is a must try in Chicago. I usually get the Lou with sausage. If you dine-in, the pizzas take 30-40mins to make so definitely order some appetizers to curb your hunger until the pizza is out. I tried the calamari and garlic bread appetizers which were both really good.
