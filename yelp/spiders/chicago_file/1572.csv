Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////45 min wait for 2 on a Sat morning but I expected that since the reviews are so high so I knew it'd be popular. The service was nice and courteous but the food was meh. I got the brisket hash which sounded amazing but needed more flavor and the hash browns could have been crispness especially since they were supposed to soak up all the meat juice and gravy of the dish. Huge poetions though! Great location and good service but mediocre food .
