Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My fiancé and I came here on a Thursday afternoon, to which we were told there was about a 15-20 minute wait. We ended up sitting at the bar since there were openings, and ordered a Malnati Mule and a beer. My Malnati Mule was pretty disgusting... I couldn't finish it, and my fiancé didn't want to either. It was mostly ginger beer with some lime.
