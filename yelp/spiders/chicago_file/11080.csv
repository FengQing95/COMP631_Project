Art Institute of Chicago////To all the people that told me this place is just as good or better than the Met in NY, you're wrong. The Met is much better; plus it's free. Â For the Art Institute, it's about $25 to get in. They do offer memberships though. I would probably take advantage of it if I was a resident.
