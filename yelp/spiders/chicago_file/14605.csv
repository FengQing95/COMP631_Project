Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This time, the wait staff seemed to be overwhelmed by the crowd and were doing a tag team operation and "helping" each other. After waiting over 30 minutes for my deep dish pizza, the minimum wait time for a standard deep dish, a waiter who was not our server delivered our pizza to another table. There was a pretty clear language barrier, which did not help the situation. Since Lou's personally serves each guest their first slice, they doled out my pizza to another family, who immediately started devouring it.
