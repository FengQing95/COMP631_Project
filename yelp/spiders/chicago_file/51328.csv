Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Go to Cafe Iberico for larger portions closer to what "tapas" sizes are like in Spain.  Dishes are a notch below Ba Ba Reeba's regarding authenticity and taste, but you will get more value!  Or try Black Bull, although it's a smaller restaurant with a slightly more avant garde take on common Spanish dishes.
