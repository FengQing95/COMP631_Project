Smoque BBQ////I was drawn to the place because of the line that always seems to be formed around the block.  When I finally tried the food, it was just ok.  I loved the customer service and that is why I gave three stars.  The food left me thinking my ribs are better...Sorry guys. I wanted to love your food but,  Alas. I didn't.
