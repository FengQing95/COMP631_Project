Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The first time, we got a tapas platter because they all seemed so good and we just couldn't decide. BEST DECISION EVER. the seafood paella is yummy! We also got spicy potatoes with a magical aioli sauce ... shrimp with garlic sauce was amazing along with an octopus plate. Â and you know it is every girl's dream to get a dessert platter at the end of a meal! Best way to top off a meal with great food and fun times
