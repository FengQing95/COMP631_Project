Little Goat Diner////This place is amazing. The portions are gargantuan. My friends and I came here after a long day of work on a Monday and it was still packed. We originally tried to go to Goat on the Grill (same owner), but of course there was a 2 hour wait on a Monday night at 8 pm... So we headed over here to get some diner food. I was of course skeptical because there was no way diner food would live up to the insane amount of hype I was hearing from my friends. But man, this place is fantastic. Awe-inspiring. Think food buds exploding into a symphony in your mouth. Best yet, the drinks are fantastic and so is the coffee.
