Smoque BBQ////Get it all DAMN IT. JUST GET IT ALL. my favorite is the St Louis ribs. Although the Mac and cheese is creamy and cheese. Don't forget the peach cobbler, ahhhhhhhhhhhhh the peach cobbler. I like to add some brandy to mine just because I can. The sauce is great just the right tang. Great staff, fast service and awesome owners. It's always nice when the owners or managers of a restaurants take time out to just simply say hi. Love this place. Keep it up!!!!!!!!
