Smoque BBQ////I can't disagree with any of the great reviews about Smoque, BUT I would like to point something out. This is unquestionably one of the best BBQ spots in the Chicago land area, but only if you like a vinegar based BBQ sauce (think Virginia and/or Carolina style), so be forewarned if you are a tomato based BBQ fan. Beyond that minor detail Smoque is a "can't miss."
