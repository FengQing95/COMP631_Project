Art Institute of Chicago////I went to the Magritte exhibit yesterday (7/24/2014), at around 5:30pm. The staff associated with the exhibit needs to be better trained to understand what proper museum etiquette is. The Magritte exhibit is relatively quiet, dark, allowing for contemplation of the artist's work. I have never been to an exhibit where the museum staff is so unpleasant. They loudly shout periodically to remind us to step further into an exhibit area, and/or to clear the entrance to a particular room in the exhibit. First of all, I was several rooms down and I could hear this woman still shouting at people every few minutes.  If you have a problem with people congregating in certain areas of the exhibit, maybe the flow of the exhibit isn't designed well, and/or maybe entry to the exhibit should be even more limited to avoid having this person yell continuously throughout the exhibit.  Other staff members were also announcing (at no one in particular) "Please stand 2-3 feet from the artwork!" as well as "No photography!" and in the room with the crates "Do not lean on the crates!"  I have no problems with enforcing these rules, but what happened to the days where museum staff would know what an appropriate level of volume is, and where museum staff would go up to the offending individuals to privately whisper and let them know to not take photos or to not stand too close. As for the room with the crates - please, for god's sake, put a note on each crate saying "Do not lean on the crates." The room is much too big to have someone yelling into the room to tell people not to lean on the crates. I felt like I was at an amusement park or something with the level of shouting the staff did. It was surreal. Maybe that's the point?
