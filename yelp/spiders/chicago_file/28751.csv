Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Been to Chicago twice and both time came to Lou Malnati's. This place never changes and the deep dish here is always good. Both times I came here we got the same deep dish pizza; The Malnati Chicago Classic. The sausage, cheese, fresh tomatoes and the butter crust makes for a very delicious deep dish pizza. From the first time to the most recent time I was here it is still good!
