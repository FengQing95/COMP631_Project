Little Goat Diner////- Los Downed (4/5): braised beef, avocado, pickled cabbage and onions, and melted cheese. It also comes with the meat juice. The sandwich is stuffed with thick meat slabs. Good thing braised meat have slight chew to them and not too soft. Love the pickled veggies, i wish there was more they compliment the sandwich well. Meat juice is too salty for my taste.
