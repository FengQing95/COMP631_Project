Smoque BBQ////I started coming to Smoque right when it opened, and while the food was always fantastic they had some service bugs to work out.   Last time I went with a group of six on a crowded Saturday.  Somehow, the guy had a table ready for us to sit by the time we made it through the line to order.  Appears that those bugs have all been worked out now.
