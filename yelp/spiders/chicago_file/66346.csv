Little Goat Diner////I'll be honest: I've never been to Little Goat, or Chicago for that matter. What I have done, however, is business with them. I was putting together a Valentine's surprise for my girlfriend who had been wanting to try Stumptown Cold Brew coffee. Well, the main office for Stumptown was unable to ship any straight to me, but they gave me the names of a couple locations closer. Sure enough, Little Goat carried the drink and was willing to ship me some! The surprise went over very well! I have only good things to say about the staff of Little Goat, especially Sonja who I worked with directly to make my Valentine's Day happen. If you're looking for hospitality and kindness, Little Goat is the way to go
