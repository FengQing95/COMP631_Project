Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I would only give the food 1 star - because it just was not very good pizza - perhaps we ordered the wrong thing? Maybe there was something that tasted better. I don't think I would want to try "deep dish" pizza again though. But I gave this place an extra star because the manager's service - he acknowledged the poor service from our waitress, apologized, and took care of our bill. Overall, my experience was less than perfect, but at least it had a good ending.
