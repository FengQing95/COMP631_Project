Smoque BBQ////- Ribs: Seriously. These ribs. I'm a rib fiend and these were the best I've ever had. They're the perfect texture (tender, but not mushy/sliding off the bone). The ribs are covered in a crackling bark and come with a thicker, sweeter sauce (again, no need to go overboard on the dipping, the meat speaks for itself).
