The Purple Pig////Server helped us with some recommendations and we went with the beets, cauliflower, turkey leg, pork shoulder and the bone marrow. The beets were excellent. The pistachio sauce had a funny color but it was amazing. The flavor and the texture of the sauce was unexpected and memorable. The whipped goat cheese was smooth and it enhance the plate. The beets were perfectly cooked and not too crunchy and soft. I would highly recommend this dish.
