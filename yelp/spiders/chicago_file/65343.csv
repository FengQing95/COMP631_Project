Smoque BBQ////There's usually a long line at this place, but we got lucky and the wait time wasn't any longer than 10 minutes to get our food and seated. I know this is a barbecue joint, but my favorite thing on their menu is not their ribs, or their briskets, or the pulled pork, - it's their macaroni and cheese! They are so good, they were my two sides with the order. The ribs were good, just a bit on the dry side for me. Briskets were good also. I didn't like the sauces that came with the ribs, so I used Tabasco sauce instead.
