Little Goat Diner////We immediately order. We ordered the brandade and belly benedict. I liked the concept of this dish, but personally, I wouldn't order it again. The kimchi was not very fresh and it was sloppily thrown on the platter. I understand this is an upscale diner and perhaps that is part of the kitsch, but it just looked like one jumbled mess and not very appetizing. Moreover, I think there were too many flavors competing against each other... We also ordered the pork belly pancake. The scallion pancake was good as was the house hoisin sauce that covered the pork belly. I thought this was one of the more successful dishes of the night though it still needed some polishing. The pork belly was a bit dry but the sauce saved it! I think there was too much bok choy salad on the pancake overwhelming the ability to eat this like a "sammich." Perhaps it was meant to be eaten open face, but you could also wrap the meat and veggies into the pancake and eat it like that. We also ordered a side of the tempura mashed potatoes. Very good! A must-try. The fried pickles and onion rings were also delicious... especially the ranch and curry mayo dipping sauces. Our server was friendly though she seemed quite rushed and not wanting to engage in brief pleasantries (i.e. "How's everything tasting?"... "It's very good. I especially like the... " "Oh great!" *runs away*)
