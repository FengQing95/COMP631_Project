Little Goat Diner////Little Goat gets better the more I visit.  The menu is very extensive, so you're sure to find something you're in the mood for.  You can never go wrong with all day breakfast, but I recently was introduced to the Chickpea Salad. Wow!  I'm not usually a salad guy, but trust me on this!  I had it once with griddled chicken, and once without, and it was great both times.  The desserts are awesome, too!
