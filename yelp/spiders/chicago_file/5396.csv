The Purple Pig////+ Salt-Roasted Beets: FAVORITE DISH, no questions asked. All-caps because it was really that good. The presentation was lovely, and the flavors & textures all worked together so well - sweet, savory, a little acidity; tender beets with some crunchy pistachio bits and creamy, fluffy whipped goat cheese... Okay, maybe I just really like beets, dairy, and nut butters, so this was like the perfect dish to me haha. As long as you don't outright hate all of the above (or even if you do, have someone else order it and snag a bite - maybe you'll change your mind), give this dish a try!
