Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Finally had great Chicago style pizza while in Chicago. It was this past Friday night and arriving around 6.45 we were told it would be an hour wait. We got drinks from the bar and stood outside. We were able to pre-order our pizza so that after sitting the wait wasn't so long. And our wait to sit was only 45 minutes.
