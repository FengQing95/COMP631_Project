Smoque BBQ////I eat at Smoque every Friday night.  Ok, not every Friday night but when I'm training for a marathon, I eat there every Friday night.  My fellow runners out there will understand why I stick with this plan, when you find a good thing and it works, stick with it.  Well, I found out 2 years ago that Smoque before a long run works for me!  I absolutely adore that their ribs are dry rubbed and the sauce is served on the side, I'm not a fan of drippy messy ribs.  The fries are incredible as well as the mac and cheese (and both offer some carb loading opportunities.)  They serve my husband's all time favorite pulled pork sandwich and I happen to love the brisket!  You don't have to fight for a table either because the wonderful gentlemen there help you out with finding a seat.  I live close by (a 5 minute walk) so I'm lucky that I can get there before the rush and get my fill before it gets too crowded.  But watch out after Cubs games, the place is crazy busy with Cubs fans.  My husband and I have tried many many other BBQ places and Smoque always wins for us....love the food and love the staff.  And I love that when we walk in, the guys always ask "how far you running tomorrow?!"
