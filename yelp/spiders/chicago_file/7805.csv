Art Institute of Chicago////What's not to love in a museum with diverse types of art, including many displays of historic architectural pieces in the main hall. My favorite piece is always the Serat. The centerpiece as you walk in the doors at the top of the second floor. There's something for everyone here. Including some giant buddahs and stonework from Japan. Well worth the price of admission.
