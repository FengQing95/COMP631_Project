Little Goat Diner////For dessert we tried a banana cake with a layer of bacon and peanut butter frosting. I was skeptical of whether a dessert could be truly heavenly without chocolate but alas it is true! I could have died and gone to heaven if eating this for breakfast. I think it'd be a great addition to a brunch menu as well.
