Little Goat Diner////I've never had anything to eat from here, but the coffee is GREAT!  I am kind of fussy about my cappuccino, and they make a great one.  The baristas and cashiers are also very welcoming and are quick to learn who you are and what you drink if you are a regular.  The best part of my morning!  Thanks guys!
