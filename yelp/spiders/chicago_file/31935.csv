Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place was amazing! A true taste of Chicago! My wife ordered the penne pasta, and I ordered the classic deep dish pizza. We are advised that the pizza takes 30+ minutes to make so my wife and I had the penne come out first to split then split the pizza. Penne pasta is something I'd never choose to order myself but I'm glad she ordered it. It was very tasty. Then when the pizza came out, we were both blown away! Great flavor and gooey deep dish consistency! So good
