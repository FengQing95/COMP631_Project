Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The first time I came to Ba-Ba-Reeba was in 1999.  It was the first time I had ever had tapas, and really, this kind of food in general.  My friend did the ordering and I initially turned my nose up at the bacon-wrapped dates.  She put one on my plate and said "really, just try it".
