Smoque BBQ////Ever since I saw them on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dive my hubby and I love this place.  The best ribs ever in the hood.  They are always packed always a long line any day any time.  It only tells you the food is awesome!  People kept coming back. Its so convenient for us because it nearby :)
