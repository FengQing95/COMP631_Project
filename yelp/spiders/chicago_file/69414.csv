Little Goat Diner////4.5 stars. Falling into the upscale Diner trend, the Little Goat is exactly what I'm looking for in a restaurant. Affordable, Filling food with a unique culinary flair, all served without the pretense of most fine dining establishments. The sister restaurant of the more upscale Girl and the Goat a few minutes down the road, the Little Goat Tavern feels like an IHop but eats like the recipes were curated by a Top Chef Winner. Which they are; Stephanie Izard has made some flavor combinations that still evoke the heartiness of diner food but with a little more culinary complexity. Came with 4 friends, and among the 5 of us we ordered the Little Piggy went to China, the Club, the Los Drowned, the Bullseye French Toast, and the Pork Belly Scallion Pancakes. Consensus agreement: No misses. Everybody enjoyed their food and the bites they have of the other dishes as well. The Little Piggy went to China was served on a delicious sesame biscuit, and the pork in both that and the scallion pakes was delicately seasoned but texturally congruent with the dish. The chicken in the Bullseye pancakes was incredibly crispy and the bbq maple syrup was great. And the toast was fantastic(especially with the egg cooked in it), though forewarning that dish is more on the sweet than the savory side. No complaints about the two sandwiches either; they didn't have any Asian inspired flavors but were a great rendition of classic diner fare. Although all the dishes are ordered a la carte(no sides), the portions are large enough that you don't need to order anything else. Though the nachos and tater tots did look incredibly tempting.
