Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Now those were just the drinks!  Every bite of food we ate, from the warm, chewy sourdough bread to the crunchy hash browns with caramelized onions, was absolutely delicious.  We started with a classic that actually originated in Chicago-the Shrimp DeJonghe.  Butter, garlic, shrimp, a touch of sherry, and texas toast?  Heaven!  Make sure you use that toast to sop of every last bit!
