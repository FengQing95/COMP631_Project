Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Every time we visit Chicago, we go to cafe BaBaReeba. The food continues to be great. The service was excellent. The sangria was tasty. The baby octopus with potatoes has always been a favorite. The goat cheese with tomato sauce was good. Lots of great small plate choices. Will come back next year
