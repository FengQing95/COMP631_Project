Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I had Lou's for the first time and it was amazing. We ordered a pepperoni deep dish with the butter crust. The cheese was so thick and gooey that if I had choked to death it would have been worth it. (Lol. J/K). Seriously, do yourself a favor and pick up a pie from here, you won't regret it. Best pie ever!
