Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It's hearty, flavorful, and it goes down great with a cold beer.  Want an idea of my perfect Chicago summer night?  Dinner at Lou Malnati's, then head to Wrigley Field for a Cubs game, followed up with bar hopping in River North.  Lou Malnati's I miss you, and anyone who visits Chicago, I beg them to stop in for a bite to eat.
