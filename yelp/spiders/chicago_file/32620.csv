Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////As a side note...My girlfriend had the shaved prime steak sandwich with au jus. Wow. Must try if you go. It was the highlight of our dinner tonight. I'm eating it for leftovers in our hotel as we speak. The drinks tonight we're also fairly high end. Very complex, though slightly imbalanced. Best I've had in the city so far. They have a small but we'll thought out beer menu. To see 3 floyds and bells on a list of 10 beers is good.
