Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I just left full, satisfied & in amazement, I am a hard lady to impress when it comes to steak houses. Typically, I'd do a hard pass. Made reservations for 5pm, arrived at 4:45pm and was seated right away. This isn't my first time in Chicago but this is my first time at this restaurant, our waiter Erik H. was outstanding! He was Top 3 best waiters I've ever encountered, from great recommendations, always checking in to ensure we were happy & such pleasant conversations! The ambiance of the restaurant was lovely. Everyone was very kind & great customer service. Can't wait to come back, best night cap!
