Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Went on the Wendell river boat tour and our tour guide was saying that Lou is a must try place for deep dish pizza. Hands down delicious deep dish pizza we ever had!! The crust is so buttery and crispy with every bit. I wish we had a Lou Malnati's pizzeria in Vegas!! Definitely visiting Chicago again so we can eat here!!
