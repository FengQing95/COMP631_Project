Little Goat Diner////The first thing I noticed was how big the space was- it has nice high ceilings and it felt very comfortable in there.  The second thing I noticed was the whole place was PACKED!  In fact, when we asked for a table, I think it was at least an hour wait (on a weeknight... I mean, I guess Thursday is a going out night?  Maybe?).  We decided to sit at the bar overlooking the kitchen and just get a snack.
