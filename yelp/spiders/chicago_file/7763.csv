Art Institute of Chicago////It's always nice to spend an evening here; you can easily spend 2-3 hours! The staff in charge of the tickets are very sweet and efficient. The security guard in front could be a little nicer and clearer about book bags having to be placed in front of you. There's a nice collection of Art from all over the world. My two personal favorites were: The Miniature Rooms and the religious SEAsian collection.
