Art Institute of Chicago////Why did the BD and I think our 3 year-old would be interested in the Matisse: Radical Invention 1913-1917 exhibit at the Art Institute? En route to the exhibit, we stopped to view the Asian collection and when baby girl took one look at Man-Lion Incarnation Vishnu Disemboweling King Hiranykashipu and started screaming, we figured she might not be ready for the AI. As we tried to explain to her that this was art--like the arts and crafts projects she does at school-- she gave us a look like,"This doesn't look like the macaroni, glue and construction paper projects we make in Miss Betsy's class." Sigh.
