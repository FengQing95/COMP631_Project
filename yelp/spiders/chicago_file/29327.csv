Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I had many different Chicago style pizza before this one. And this is the second time having Lou Malnati. From my food tour I've learned that the executive of this pizzeria hand picks their tomatoes every year from Europe. Pretty impressive on how much thought goes into make a perfect pizza. The crust was very crunchy for my taste, but they do season them with butter and other ingredients. We had cheese pizza, which it still had a lot of flavor. When you visit, I would recommend ordering the food over the phone and come eat at the restaurant. it will take 40-45 mins to have the pizza made. There are two floors on this location and they do have an elevator.
