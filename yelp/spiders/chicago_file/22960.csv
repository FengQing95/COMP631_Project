Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The worst service I've ever had. It took me over 20 minutes just for someone to approach my table. Some of the things I ordered didn't even come out. The dry pasta and pizza were mediocre. All my friends were excited try out this restaurant and it wasn't really all worth it.
