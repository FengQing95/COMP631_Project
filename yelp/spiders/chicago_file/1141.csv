Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I can't imagine anyone giving this place less than 5 stars. Our server was extremely efficient and attentive. I got two eggs over easy with sausage, hash browns, and rye toast. Everything came out within 10 minutes, was cooked perfectly, and was delicious. The five star bonus: they brought us real sides of raspberry jam for our toast (not the gross ones that come in the little plastic containers at most restaurants). Next time I'm in Chicago, I will definitely be back!
