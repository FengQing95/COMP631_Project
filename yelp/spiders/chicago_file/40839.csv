Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////At the recommendation of my neighbors at the bar, we ordered the chicken and ham croquettas, which were kind of too oily at first but really grew on me. By my second piece, I was devouring the thing. We also had the seared sea scallops with raisins, couscous and pine nuts, which was probably my favorite dish of the night. The butcher's paella was on the salty side and the rice felt somewhat undercooked, which was a shame because the idea of a whole lotta meat + paella sounded amazing (-1 star here.. if you're going to claim paella as your signature dish, it should blow my mind!) The beef short ribs in the paella were delicious, though, and the next time I go I will definitely order the rioja short ribs! We tried the beef tenderloin with blue cheese as well, which was nothing special. What really made my meal was the sangria for sure. We tired the red, white, black raspberry, and peach by the glass to figure out which one we liked best, and eventually ordered a full pitcher of the black raspberry.
