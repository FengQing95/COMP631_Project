Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We went during Orange Festival and started off with  an orange amouse bouche (which was not an amouse bouche, I might add -- it was a whole plate of food).  It was oranges, beets, goat cheese, quince, and marcona almonds.  The beets were grated which gave the dish a very strange texture.
