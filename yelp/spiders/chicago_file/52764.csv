Smoque BBQ////so, with that said, i ate my (very minimal) leftovers the next day for dinner so that right there is a huge compliment. i never, ever do that. i always take my doggie bag home with all the right intentions but then they just get stock piled in the fridge until its too late to save their poor souls! sad, neglected, delicious leftovers :(
