Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We arrived at 4:45 and got in the que. We then pre ordered large classic pizza. We were seated at 6:15 and were told it would be another 20min. Our pizza arrived at 6:45! So be prepared to wait and wait and wait. I think their preorder is a scam. But what do I know. Still sitting here waiting on our dessert that we ordered when we sat down. I believe without their pre order scam no one would put up with these kinds of wait times. Pizza was good but I have a better at home. Oh and btw we were just told they forgot our pizza and we would have to wait another 15mins if we wanted one. So much for my husband birthday "cake"! They did give us a discount on our check because of the cookie problem but come on we ordered it when we first sat down at our table.
