Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I never really was a tapas fan.  But this place blew my mind.  Everything I tried (and I tried a lot) was amazing. The chicken empanadas was so good and the garlic sauce that came with it made it even better. The cherry sauce meatballs were delicious. The spicy potatoes with aioli sauce was so good. They had a bacon wrapped date which I never even thought that combo would ever go together tasted so so good. I can't wait to go back. This place has easily become my favorite place to eat.
