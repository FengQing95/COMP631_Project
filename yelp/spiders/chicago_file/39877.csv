Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Service is fantastic. Menu is pretty diverse, even if you don't like steak. Hot chicken, anyone? Each couple split their popular 42 day aged ribeye which was delicious. I say that it's flaky, but I mean that in the very best way. It was so tender and tasty. Appetizer: goat cheese with marinara and some Parmesan maybe? Served with Texas toast. Really enjoyed that. Sides: creamed spinach (not my pick but it was good), candied sweet potatoes (yum), and TRUFFLE MAC AND CHEESE. I'd go back and just eat a bowl of this. Holy cannoli, so so good. Sides are easily shared between 2 people. The sourdough bread is something like mom would make in a bread maker at home. It came out so warm and fluffy. Salted butter melted right over it.
