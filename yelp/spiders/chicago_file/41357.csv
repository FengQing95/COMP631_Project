Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Debating between 3 and 4 stars because this place is corporate,  but Ba-Ba-Reeba is key for large groups and taking visitors.  You know you'll always be served quality food and great sangria.  Garlic potatoes and skirt steak are a must.  Two things to keep in mind, this place is owned by Let Us Entertain You, so if you're expecting quaint mom and pop, try somewhere else.  Also, the floor tends to get slippery!
