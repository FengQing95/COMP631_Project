Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pizza was actually only so, so I thought. I got the sausage and cheese. Maybe it's my lack of experience with deep dish pizzas but I must say I prefer my Digiornio which is more flavorful. This pizza was very one dimensional in terms of taste but the crust was on point. The place was packed so it must be a local favorite.
