Little Goat Diner////If you are looking for something unique and delicious this is the place I love Little Goat Diner. The servers are great, the food is delicious honestly the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because upon arrival they told be the wait would be over 4 hours. I was going to leave but decided to go on yelp and reserved a seat not even 10 minutes later I was seated.
