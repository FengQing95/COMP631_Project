Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is yummy deep dish! It is probably the best I've had in Chicago (waaaaay better than Giordano's) but - and maybe this is sacrilegious to say - I've had better outside Chicago (I'm thinking especially of Patxi's in the Bay Area). We shared a classic deep dish cheese pizza with their special buttercrust. I loved the tomato sauce - it was sweet and light and had large chunks of whole tomato. It was more like real tomato sauce in Italy than the sauce at many other pizza places in the US. The crust was good too - nice and buttery as advertised. I would return!
