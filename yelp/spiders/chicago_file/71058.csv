Little Goat Diner////I was with another friend and we got a seat at the bar in the back and ordered drinks and food pretty much immediately with no problem whatsoever. I got the chick pea salad with kale, carrots, cabbage, celery, colby cheese, and ranch dressing (I didn't use that.) They also gave you 4 little chick pea "hush puppies" is what I would call them (deep fried.) It rocked. I really like the different mix of cruncy veggies. My friend got the reuben and from the looks of it he really liked it. I got the Mickey Blue eyes drink which was literally blue. This is one of the first cocktails I have ordered (off a cocktail menu) in a long time that I did not think was way too sweet. It is vodka, and I want to say St Germain? Anyway, it was the perfect mix of tart and sweet. Service was fast and friendly at the bar. We had 3 friends come later and join us. One girl got the quesadilla and they looked amazing, more like "loaded quesadillas" they were served almost like nachos. Overall, I loved this place and will be back for sure.
