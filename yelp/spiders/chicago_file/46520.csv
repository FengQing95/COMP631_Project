Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've heard about this place and passed it on many different occasions but never had a reason to really go BUT I just had my chance a couple weeks ago while having a mother daughter weekend with my mom and a close friend from home and her mom.  We tried many different things on the menu and they were all very flavorful.  My favorite... the paella of course.  I don't know why, but every time I go to any Spanish restaurant I must try the paella.  One day I'm just going to make it for myself, but until then... I will go back to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba for that dish alone.
