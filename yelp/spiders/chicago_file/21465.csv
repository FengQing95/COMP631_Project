Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Bottom line--I like Lou's more than I like the other top named Chicago deep dish restaurant. Â Choosing the better pizza between the two is a lot like trying to chose between being catholic or protestant--subject to deeply held personal beliefs and open to violent argument. I found Lou's much more user-friendly and comfortable, and the calamari was a wonderful surprise.
