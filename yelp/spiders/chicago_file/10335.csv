Art Institute of Chicago////This is a magnificent museum any way you look at it, through it or around it. I don't know of another place that has a higher ratio of familiar masterpieces to total pieces of art, and I am including the Louvre, the Hermitage and the Metropolitan. What I like most is its lack of pretension and ostentation. I think the $12 admission is a bargain, and the presentation is clean and well-organized in every room.
