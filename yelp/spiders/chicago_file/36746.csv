Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My ribeye steak, which was ordered medium rare, was a little too rare in places, but delicious none the less. The sides are nothing to write home about, but good. We had the shrimp de jonghe for an appetizer, and the shrimp were delicious. It also came with Texas toast which I could make a whole meal out of. Service was fantastic, although we had to ask for bread a few times before getting it.
