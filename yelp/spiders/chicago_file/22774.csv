Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The service was great, our waiter explained everything in detail, had suggestions and answered my questions perfectly.  Our appetizer came out in a decent amount of time which was about 30-35 minuets.  It was a perfect deep dish pizza and served piping hot.  Our waiter served the first pieces of pizza and the. It was up to us to eat this amazing pizza, the cheese was melted perfectly layered with tomato sauce and pepperoni.  The crust was perfect, golden brown with a nice butter taste and could be a meal on its own.  I love pizza and this deep dish was everything I wanted it to be and more.  So worth the wait and the time it too, to eat it.  Yummy!
