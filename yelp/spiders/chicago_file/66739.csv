Little Goat Diner////Oh my gawd. This place is beyond amazing! I had the fish tostadas and we ordered Mac n Cheese as an appetizer. The portions are generous and very tasteful! You won't leave hungry. They have a decent selection of drinks and the service was great! We sat at this long community table with other people which always makes things fun and interesting. I will be back for sure!
