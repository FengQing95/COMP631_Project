Little Goat Diner////The Bulls eye french toast was good on the first bite but after that like some others have said it just gets to be a very weird taste. I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be a sunny side egg in the middle that would break the egg yolk all over, instead it was an almost cooked egg with no runny egg yolk. I don't know it was just kind of odd tasting and each bite got more unpleasant.
