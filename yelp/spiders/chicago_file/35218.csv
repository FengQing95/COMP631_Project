Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's works. From the cool atmosphere (yes, dark) to the cool cocktails being professionally made at the stainless steel topped bar, to the clubby booths, to the exposed brick walls. Our waiter was unpretentious, he had great recommendations, he intuited our cadence and slowed down the service when he realized we were there to talk, drink, and eat, and the whole night was perfect.
