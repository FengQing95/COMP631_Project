Smoque BBQ////I love their ribs - the baby-backs are melt-in-your-mouth perfection, and the St. Louis ones will almost ruin you for all others.  The sauce, served on the side, is tangy with a kick of sweet.  Not too much, not too little, and it complements the meat well.  If I was not afraid of being socially ostracized, I'd put a straw in the BBQ sauce and hit it.  My only regret?  I can't eat the bones.  I guess I'll have to settle for sucking on them.  Poor me!
