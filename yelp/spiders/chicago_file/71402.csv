Little Goat Diner////Our server was friendly and attentive, and we really liked being able to see the bustle in the kitchen. Â Hilariously, one of the coolers had a neatly printed label on it that read PLEASE DO NOT PUT SH*T ON TOP OF THIS COOLER, which was made even more amusing by the fact that there were three commercial-sized boxes of plastic wrap on top of it.
