The Purple Pig////This place has over 7k reviews and has 4.5 stars on Yelp so I was beyond excited to make reservations for my friends and I. We came hungry and eager to try a plate from each category in the menu. We are big foodies and have been traveling all over Chicago going to expensive spots, hole in the walls and hyped restaurants. From Alinea to Portillo. I have to say this was the worst place of them all. The food was salty and unbalanced and unimpressive. The worst part was there was hair in the food . The tuna tartare had a long hair and we didn't want to make it a big deal but we let the staff know and they took the plate asked if we wanted another and that was it. The meal was not compensated let alone the tuna tartare plate. That was wild to me. I would never make a costumer pay for a plate that had a hair on it. Anyways I don't recommend this horrible place.
