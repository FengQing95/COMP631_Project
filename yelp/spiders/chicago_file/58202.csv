Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I like taking pics of new places I try and when the paella came out, the food runner was very rude. He didn't let me take a pic. He immediately mixed everything into slop. And I was holding my phone next to him but her ignored me. A busser saw it and they were laughing to each other. They said some Spanish to each other, laughed and didn't stop for me to take a pic. The food runner just immediately piled the slop onto plates. I understand they were in a hurry but this was very rude!!!
