Smoque BBQ////Holy cow bro... THE SLICED BRISKET IN THIS PLACE AND THE RIBS WORTH IT MEN WORTH IT. I guess the only counter part is their bbq sauce but it's the best BBQ Meat you can get in Chicago. Even there caramel pecan bread is freaking amazing for those after sweet cravings. So into the bbq, they only got two sauces over there and one is thick and the other kind of spicy. I prefer thick sauce but I've tried better bbq sauces. But that doesnt mean anything when u trying those smoked flavor ribs. The coleslaw is kind of sour and sweet so good. Potatoe fries are ok and crunchy. Suit yourself with the picture
