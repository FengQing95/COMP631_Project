Little Goat Diner////We came here for my husband's birthday breakfast with 4 kids and 4 adults. The food was fantastic not one of us ordered the same dish and we were all very pleased! They even gave my husband an oversized Cinnabon with sprinkles for his bday and the kids gobbled it up! Our waiter couldn't have been nicer and they were very kid friendly! We will be back again and again and again! Thank you!
