Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were fortunate enough to stay a hotel within walking distance from Lou Malnati's.  So we checked in and put our luggage and ran over to get our first meal in Chicago (which had to be a Chicago deep dish).  We went at an off hour, so it just a short wait for a table.  While waiting, we pre-ordered our pizza to save time.
