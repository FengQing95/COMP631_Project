Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My go-to favorites here are the potatoes and the wrapped dates. There's always enough on the small plate for everyone, and you can probably feel decently full from these two alone. The bacon wrapped dates have a very sweet date in the middle wrapped by strong, smoky bacon, all drenched in a juicy sauce. You can never have just one bite! However, if you need a bit of vegetables or something more refreshing, I would also recommended the brussels sprout salad.
