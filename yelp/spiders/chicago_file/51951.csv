Smoque BBQ////Wow, really impressed, and my expectations were already high!  We traversed here from Oak Park since everyone raves about Smoque.  I'm from the South and one of my friends in the group is originally from North Carolina so we are very picky about ribs. barbecue, etc.  The traditional ribs, and brisket are excellent!  Don't forget to bring your beer, BYOB, oh and the mac and cheese is actually done well, more of the thick bechamel base  over the watery mix typical at other places.  Even when there is a wait, it doesn't feel bad because total wait time includes you+food at the table since you wait to order, then staff get you a table.  Enjoy!
