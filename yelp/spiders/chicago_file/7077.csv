Art Institute of Chicago////Even better than a $40 student membership?  The special exhibits.  I've been here often enough now that I can skip the Seurats and the American Gothics, but I've been continuously impressed by the quality of the exhibits that come through... even the ones I didn't intend upon visiting!  Favorites have been the Japanese screens last year and the Hyperlinks exhibit that is currently going on.  I strongly believe that this is the best reason to get a membership, since the AI is always bringing in interesting art that I would have never considered.
