Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Picked Bavette's for my birthday celebration. Sat in the parlor downstairs and loved the atmosphere. Excellent service and fabulous food. Never felt rushed and the waiter was very informative about the menu. Had a French martini to start. Shared the crab stuffed avocado with Bibb lettuce for appetizer. I loved the dressing but if you're not a tarragon fan this dish is not for you. Had the petite filet done perfectly medium rare minus. Just melted in your mouth. Best filet I've had in a long time. Shared the baked potato side which is actually 2 potatoes. Had the sour cream, bacon, cheese and chives on the side. The bacon was the absolute star of this dinner! It was like candy!! Nice glass of Pinot Noir complimented the steak and bacon. They brought out double scoop of excellent chocolate ice cream for a surprise birthday dessert. Definitely recommend dining here!
