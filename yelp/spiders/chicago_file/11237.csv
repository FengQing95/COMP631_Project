Art Institute of Chicago////We were worried about coming here during Museum Week, as we thought it would be packed since it's free to Illinois residents. But since the Women's March was starting just down the block and security wouldn't let anyone in with posters, it was very empty that Saturday morning. The spaces are great, and if you love modern art then you'll really like this place. I greatly enjoyed the furniture from different eras and regions, but they weren't all gathered in one place so sometimes they'd just pop up while you're randomly walking through the Impressionist section or the American Modern Art section.
