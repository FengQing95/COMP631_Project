Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Finally got a chance to stop into the famous Cafe Ba Ba Reeba and I was impressed! The food was tasty and very reasonably priced, the wine was also inexpensive for the taste. I love how the menu is broken out by veggie options, seafood and meat, easy for me, a pescatarian to see what my options are without any grey area. Our server Ryan was super helpful and friendly as well. Also, I want to give a shout out to whoever makes the bread because it was delicious; fresh, warm, and soft. We will be back in the near future for our next Tapas fix.
