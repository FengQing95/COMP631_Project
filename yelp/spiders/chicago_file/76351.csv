Little Goat Diner////It's pretty good. Some of the menu can be a little intimidating for my taste, but that's okay they've got the classics and they nail it. Go all out though, order the latte, get some bacon and add some hash browns!!  Make a breakfast reservation and if you order right, you'll only need 2 meals in your day. Good size portions, awesome service that lets you chill and keeps the waters full.  Highly recommend even if it's a but out of the way.
