Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When we finally got seated (uptairs, which I didn't know they had) we still ended up waiting maybe 20-25 minutes. Not sure what the point was in pre-ordering when it still felt like eternity. When we finally got our pizza it wasn't even piping hot. I boomeranged the first slice getting pulled and the cheese pull was hardly there. Slight disappointment.
