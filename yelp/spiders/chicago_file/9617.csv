Art Institute of Chicago////A-maz-ing! It's downtown Chicago, in the Loop, so expect traffic, parking garages, and an expensive entrance fee (only a $2 discount for locals?!), but it is SO worth it. We were there for over a half day and didn't get through all of it. Probably not even half. The building itself is beautiful.
