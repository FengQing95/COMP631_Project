Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We get to Bavette's at 9 PM. We had a 9:15 PM reservation, so I was expecting to wait awhile and grab a drink at the bar. I was surprised because we were seated right away. Seems like we are off to a good start, right? Well, being seated quickly was the ONLY thing that went well for us at Bavette's.
