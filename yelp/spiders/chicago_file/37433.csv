Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The 45(maybe 42? can't remember) day dry aged ribeye is absolutely amazing, I said top 2 o3 3 in Chicago above, but honestly, as someone who has been to a ton of Chicagos best steakhouses, it's the best I've had so far, and I can cook a mean steak. Their starters and sides are also fantastic, I've had the Baked Goat Cheese, the Peppered Duck and Goat Cheese Terrine, the Pommes Frites, the Buttery Mashed Potatoes, the Loaded Baked Potato, the Truffle Mac, and the Thick Cut Bacon, and ALL were great sides/starters. The service every time I've been there has been solid to fantastic, they are always kind and attentive, and the overall feel of the place, especially the downstairs seating, is fantastic. Their drink selection is pretty awesome as well, you won't be disappointed in any way with this place.
