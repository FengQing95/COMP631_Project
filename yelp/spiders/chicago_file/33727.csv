Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The cocktails? To die for.  I'm writing this review a few weeks after the fact, so I can't precisely recall the name, but it had Lillet Blanc, St. Germain, and vodka. It looked so simple on paper, but it was hands down the best cocktail I've had in my life (and believe me, they are many).  As soon as you lift the glass a bright nose of fresh lemon hits you before your first sip and on tasting, every flavor is in perfect balance and harmony.  I similarly appreciated their beer menu.  Though not extensive, any place that carries the Taddy Porter knows what they're doing.
