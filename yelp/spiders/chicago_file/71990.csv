Little Goat Diner////Disclaimer: Do not come here if you are on a diet!  That said, this place is phenomenal.  Little Goat fully embodies the comfortable and friendly diner feel that they are going for...and beautifully combines it with modern and ingenious creations, bold flavors, and a very chic vibe.  The food is reasonably priced for the quality and unique dishes that are offered.  Chef Steph has added a very strong Korean/Asian influence to many of the offerings and even the weirder sounding fusion items are blended amazingly.
