Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Now onto the real review here for Lou Malnati's. I was in town for work and decided to give it a go before heading back to O'Hare. Service in the afternoon was quick and easy and I struck up a conversation with the bartender there that afternoon. He helped me walk through their menu and ultimately convinced me to get the Lou. I got an individual portion just for myself. My oh my, was I surprised to see just how much a small pizza was and how filling it was! The crust was flaky and the sausage was a perfect complement to the pizza, though the oil on the pizza was a bit much at times. Fork and knife definitely needed! The staff's recommendations were spot on and their pizza was something that allowed me to taste something unique to Chicago. I enjoyed the food overall and the service was great. Granted that it wasn't a super busy late Friday afternoon (it was 25 degrees out) I was glad to have been able to eat some good Chicago deep dish while also being able to converse with some locals.
