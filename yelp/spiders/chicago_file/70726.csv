Little Goat Diner////Five of us had breakfast at Little Goat Diner last weekend.  I was not overly excited about the food, the coffee or the service.  I ordered a veggie omelette and the omelette was greasy, flat (not fluffy like most omelettes) and the veggies were tasteless.  Toast needed to be ordered a la carte for an extra $3.  The brewed coffee and the lattes were lukewarm.  We said something to our server about the temp of the coffee and nothing changed with the next round of coffees.  We mentioned it again and no solution was offered.  Our server seemed nice, but was not engaged with us, friendly or warm/welcoming.  The whole experience was very mediocre.  I don't plan to return soon or recommend Little Goat Diner to friends.
