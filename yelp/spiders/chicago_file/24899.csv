Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It was surprisingly delicious!  I loved the garlic bread too.  For two people, you are better off getting the small and splitting (it's a thick and heavy slice of pizza).  Anyway, I had a good time and although I'm not a fan of deep dish due to two poor experiences in the past, this has slightly changed my perception.
