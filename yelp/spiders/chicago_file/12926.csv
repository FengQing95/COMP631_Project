Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Quick trip to Chicago and had to get in a deep dish.  Lou Malnati's is it!  I haven't had pizza anywhere close to this.  The cheese was perfect and you can taste each piece of sausage.  The crust, that was a nice surprise at the end of your slice, makes you think about which end you want to start your next slice on.
