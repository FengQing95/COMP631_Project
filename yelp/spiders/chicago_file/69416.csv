Little Goat Diner////Little Goat Diner is my newest love in Chicago. It's all the commitment to flavor and distinctive ingredients of Girl and the Goat channeled into diner food. Open from 7 am until 2 am, I can't wait to go here when I'm near the loop and in desperate need of food late. I've also yet to try breakfast here, so eagerly looking forward to that as well. Will update this as it happens.
