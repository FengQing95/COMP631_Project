Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I know, this is a staple, and I'm a Chicagoan, so I know my Chicago-style pizza. But I prefer Giordano's, and here's why: Lou Malnati's has a tendency to choke me. The cheese chokes me. The slab of sausage (which is like a layer of sausage smooshed into the bread) chokes me. I like the tomato slices on top, but that's not worth giving an extra star. The crust is ok, but I prefer Giordano's again because Lou's is too dry. In this city, choosing your pizza place is like choosing your baseball team, and I've had drag-out fights over this Lou's business. But I'm sticking with my Giordano's (or the original Uno).
