Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The steak was by far the highlight of the meal. Everything we had was rich with butter and I don't recommend getting the baked potato as a side unless you can eat a ton of food - it is huge. But back to the steak. I'd ordered the meatloaf and I wished I had ordered the steak instead. Since it was huge I ate a lot of it and it was by far the better of the two entrees. The apple salad we started with was light and fresh and so what we needed after eating all of the amazing bread slathered in butter. I thought the price of the meal - around $100 for all we got was well worth it. We will be back for sure.
