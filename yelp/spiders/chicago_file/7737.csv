Art Institute of Chicago////I can;t believe that there exists some people who have given a rating below 5 on this one. I am not an art enthusiast, but I have been to this place 4 times in the past 1year, I can't stop myself from not walking in when I am in Chicago. And I am sure there are rooms I have yet to visit.
