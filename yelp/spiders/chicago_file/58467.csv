Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Atmosphere: Great restaurant, much larger than I suspected when looking at the place from the outside. Several dining areas throughout the establishment allowing them to serve quite a large number of guests. Even with the crowd, the kitchen had no issue keeping up with our order.
