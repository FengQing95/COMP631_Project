Little Goat Diner////Crazy good. I had the sloppy goat sandwich with smoked fries. You can tell they care a lot about their food because the meat, the Cole slaw dressing and the brioche bun were the perfect compliment to each other. Their beer selection was also strong. Would definitely recommend this 'diner' experience. They serve their whole menu all day (a lot of breakfast items) and everything looked amazing. Go there hungry and leave full and happy.
