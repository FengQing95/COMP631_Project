Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////this is tapas for rookies. the food is expensive, not all that tasty.. super over-described and under-delivered (as if that tuna was olive oil poached or even ahi tuna... tasted like canned, yum, but nonetheless). and what is that stale as shit bread that they have on the table. get me fresh bread!
