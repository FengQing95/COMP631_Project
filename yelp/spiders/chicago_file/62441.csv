Smoque BBQ////Brisket and pulled pork are good, but the ribs are heavenly. They use 11 spices in their rub to form the most amazing outer crust. Side bbq sauce is on point with champion bbq. If you like chili, the brisket chili will not dissapoint. Prices are pretty darn good (sandwiches $7, includes delicious slaw). A full slab of ribs is $17 (you'd pay $20 at famous daves). It does get crowded, but usually in spurts (not constant), but they have a very efficient system (one cashier, bunch of guys cooking, and they line the orders up on the counter). Even though seating can feel a little cramped, it's not bad considering the size of the building.
