Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is a great spot for most occasions! We showed up around 7:45 as walk ins and waited about 30-45 minutes for a table. We ordered the passion fruit sangria and snacked on some complimentary bread before deciding on the beef tenderloin with blue cheese, chicken empanada and spicy potatoes. I usually order these as well as a few more items, but yesterday we were really in the mood for some sangria! We had the truffle cake for dessert, which did not disappoint. Service was prompt and waters were always full. The spicy potatoes never came, but it was one of those "for the best" moments because we were already full. This is one of those places that I will always come back to!
