The Purple Pig////Once entering the side of the building they have an outside patio that it's covered with a purple tent and heated lamps for the cold weather. It was around 3pm and it was a full house, wait time for 2 was around 30 minutes. They take your cell phone number to confirm your wait time and then you receive another text letting you know that your table is ready and you have 10 minutes to claim it by replying Y for YES.
