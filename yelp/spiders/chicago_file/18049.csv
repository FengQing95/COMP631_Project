Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Stopped in last night around 10 PM and it was fairly busy. Tried to get a table but we were pretty tired from walking around all day so we got it to go. Ordered the Lou with half mushrooms half none, brought it back to the hotel. Everything was piping hot and mouth watering. The cheese is always melty and amazing, the best part is always the tomato slices on the top, I'm a huge tomato guy, love them. Always tell my friends who are heading to Chicago to go here!
