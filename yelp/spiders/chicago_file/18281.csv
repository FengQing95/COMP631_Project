Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Got the Lou Special and Chicago Classic with a few round of Goose 312 and a fried mushroom appetizer to start. This was my first savory piece of pie eaten in Chi-Town so I was stoked when it came out oozing with cheese and sat tall and firm like a mini skyscraper of flavor. The fried mushroom were awesome as well!!! Whole button mushrooms lightly breaded and fried to a nice crisp without being greasy to the touch.
