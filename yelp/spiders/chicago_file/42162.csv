Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////After giving this place a second chance, I was much more pleased with my experience. The food and sangria were delicious, so I decided it was worth another go. Not only was the waitstaff friendly and attentive, the food was very good. The goat cheese and tomato sauce is definitely worth trying, and the spicy potatoes were also amazing. A friend of mine got the Spanish omelet, which was also very good. Definitely glad I gave this place another shot!
