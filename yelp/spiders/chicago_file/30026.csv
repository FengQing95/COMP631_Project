Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They are genius here! Order your pizza ahead of time, while you wait to be seated... GENIUS, right? My daughter and I came here on a very busy Saturday afternoon of a holiday weekend. Even though I thought we came in at a good time (after lunch & before dinner rush), it was still a 40-minute wait. No problem though because we were able give them our pizza order, since that took the longest. I think we waited a little less than 40 minutes to get our table, but as soon as we sat down, they said our pizza was going to be out in 10 minutes. So, we ordered calamari for the appetizer and it was perfect (not rubbery at all). We ordered a small pizza, but it was still big enough for probably 4 of us (only there were 2 of us). I barely was able to finish my one slice and felt like I had to roll outta there. Customer service was excellent and our waitress still had time to be friendly and courteous. Thanks Lou Malnati's for always being incredible!
