Little Goat Diner////For entrees, we went with sandwiches. I got the reuben, and the boyfriend got the Los Drowned. The reuben was delicious; there was kimchi on the reuben. KIMCHI ON THE REUBEN! It was a spectacular deliciousness. Boyfriend was a little disappointed with the Los Drowned. He enjoyed it, but wasn't impressed. It was basically a fancier version of an Italian beef sandwich, which by no means is a bad thing, but didn't really send him over the top.
