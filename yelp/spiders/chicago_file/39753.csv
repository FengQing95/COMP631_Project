Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I went here for my boyfriend's birthday, and all of the food was really really good! We did a whole spread! We got the baked crab cakes, dry aged bone-in ribeye, brussel sprouts for the side, and white fish salad that was on the specials menu. My gosh, everything was so absolutely delicious! In our opinion though, the baked crab cakes were the star of our dinner! Do not sleep on those baked crab cakes!! Also I must add that the service here was amazing!
