Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malmatti was my first deep dish pizza experience back in 2015 during my first trip to Chicago. I was back again for another round of my deep dish pizza fix on 10/13/17 around 7 pm with my partner. It was a busy Friday night and as expected long line was awaiting before us.
