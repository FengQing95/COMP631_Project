Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////YUM. Ordered the bone in wings to start, by far the best wings I have ever had. The sauces were out of this world. Then got the Keto Crustless pizza (made out of sausage). It was DELICIOUS! Waiter was so friendly, prices were fair, and Keto pizza exceeded expectations. Will be going back.
