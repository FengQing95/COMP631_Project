Little Goat Diner////Funny thing here is that my friend strangely was playing with the straws that are used for cocktail glasses however he wasn't playing with his own straw- Â he was playing with the group of straws that were being kept when a drink is made. The bartender kindly asked him to stop playing with the straws but then had to take about 50 or 60 of them out and throw them away because they have been touched by his hands. He was naturally embarrassed/horrified and deservedly so. I want to take the bartender for not making a big deal out of what he was doing. Great job!
