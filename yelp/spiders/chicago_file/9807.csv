Art Institute of Chicago////I plan a lot of my trips around visiting Art museums. I specifically went to New York for MOMA, to San Francisco for SFMOMA, etc ... I've had the Art Institute on my radar for quite a while, with every intention of making a dedicated trip to see it at some point, but didn't get a chance until just recently when I was "stuck" in Chicago for two days after missing a connecting flight at O'Hare.
