Smoque BBQ////Pretty darn good, for a northern state's BBQ.  I was battling myself on whether to give it a 3 or 4 stars.  I think I hold BBQ joints to a much higher standard because it's just a crime to serve bad BBQ! Maybe because I know what Kansas City BBQ tastes like I may have a slight bias.  There are so few BBQ joints up here, I had to give it a 4.
