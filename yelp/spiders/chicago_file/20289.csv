Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I only give this location 3 stars instead of 4 because I have been to the Gold Coast location which is just better. It's bigger so the line goes quicker. This location is just smaller, and filled with out of towners who (rightfully) want some Chicago Pie. No foul on the tourists, just makes it busier in a busy city.
