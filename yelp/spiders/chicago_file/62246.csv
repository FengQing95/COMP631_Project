Smoque BBQ////I came here with a friend a few nights ago. The line was really, really long, but don't be discouraged - it also moves pretty quickly, and we needed pretty much that amount of time to decide what we wanted to get anyways. We ended up ordering: a full slab of baby back ribs (for me) and a pulled pork sandwich (for him), along with orders of fries for both of us.
