Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We came here on a weekday for lunch around 11:45 am.  There were only a few tables taken so we got a seat easily.  We ordered the The Malnati Chicago Classic and the server informed us it would take about 40 minutes to make the pizza.  Around 12:30 nearly every table in the restaurant was taken so I would definitely recommend coming by 12:15 pm if you are coming for lunch on a weekday.
