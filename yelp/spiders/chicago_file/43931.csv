Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The seafood paella was fishy tasting in a bad way.  Have you ever had a bad shrimp?  I mean, a stay-in-time-out or-10-minutes-because-it's=been-so-bad shrimp? I put a shrimp in my mouth, chewed a little, swallowed a little, popped out my eyes a little, gagged a little, and spit the thing into my napkin.  I wanted to cry because I thought I was going to die the next day due to shrimp poisoning.  Then I remembered that my friend ate raw oysters wrapped in raw bacon and survived.  Still, it was guh-ross!
