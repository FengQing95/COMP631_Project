Little Goat Diner////I had the Elvis Waffles - HIGHLY recommend. The waffles are fluffy and delightful, just like a waffle should be. But the kicker is the peanut butter butter, the syrup with bits of real bacon in it, and the bananas cut up on top. I couldn't eat the whole thing (the servings are generous!) but I sure wanted to.
