Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Wonderful pizza- deep dish of course. But the staff really make the place what it is. My boyfriend and I ran in an awful downpour of rain and came in soaked. We were warmly greeted and seated immediately at the bar. The bartenders were both very talkative and friendly. Waiting 40 minutes was worth it for the pizza, and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Will definitely return to this location specifically for the people who work there. My only con is that the pizza was a little burnt. Still delicious though.
