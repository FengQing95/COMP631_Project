Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Visiting and was looking for a local steakhouse. Shared the shrimp cocktail, peppered duck, dry-aged bone-in ribeye, and brussel sprouts. The food was delicious, had to talk myself into the salted carmel ice cream with hot fudge but glad I didnt skip dessert. The lighting was a bit dim and the music was a bit loud, but Brandon our waitor was very attentive without being annoying.
