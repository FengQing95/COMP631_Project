Little Goat Diner////Went on a Tuesday morning (around 9am) and the place was nearly empty and got seated immediately.  Server was great (and cute!) and the bus boys were on their game.  The server gave some suggestions and we ended up ordering the pork belly benedict, biscuit and gravy, and Bullseye French Toast.  I don't have a single complaint about any of the dishes!  All were unique and delicious.  I don't understand when Chicagoans wait an hour for places like Yolk for a breakfast I can make at home.  This place is worth the wait cause I cannot cook like this in my kitchen!  Also I would give 6 stars if i could because Stephanie was in the kitchen!!!  She actually works in her kitchens!!!
