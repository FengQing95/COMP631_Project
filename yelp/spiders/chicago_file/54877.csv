Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. It's perfect for any event: birthday, anniversary dinner, baby shower, or just brunch. The tapas are delicious as well as their sangria. Some of my favorites are the bacon wrapped dates, steak skewers, and the red sangria. Book ahead if going on a Friday or Saturday because the place is always packed. I've had some of my best memories here. This place has changed my mind on tapas.
