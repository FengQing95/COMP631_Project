Smoque BBQ////Smoque kinda failed in one arena and skated by with a 6.0 out of 10 in the other. The sauce was lackluster and minimal. I need my meat saucy. It just isn't the same for me. The meat was somewhat tender, though sometimes difficult to chew and occasionally quite tough. I don't like to work to swallow my meat. (That's what she said.)
