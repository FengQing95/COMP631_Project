Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////A fine dining restaurant can be fancy without being stuffy, and that definitely applies to Bavette's. I mean, we're here to have a fun time, drink some good drinks, and eat some great food. Please don't give us some robot waiter. Our server, Amy, warmed right up to us and vice versa, which is something we value. Her charm and humor added greatly to our evening, as did the warm hospitality of her cohorts.
