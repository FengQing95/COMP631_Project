Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! has become a tradition during our Chicago visits. Nashville doesn't have tapas and I need to get my fix. One thing I really love about Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is the consistency- our favorites remain our favorites and just how we remember them. The menu changes pretty regularly and we try to order a few new things as well as our standards. The sangria is always good but you can't beat Mondays with 1/2 prices cocktails!
