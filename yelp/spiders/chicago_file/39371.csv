Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our meal began with remarkably good sourdough bread, its warm delicate middle enrobed in a crunchy crust.   We then shared a wedge salad.  Actually this wasn't a wedge at all but a generous mound of chopped iceberg lettuce with gorgonzola, onion, egg quarters, cubes of thick bacon, and ranch dressing. It was crisp and absolutely delicious.
