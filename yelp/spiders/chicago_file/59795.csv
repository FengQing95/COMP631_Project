Smoque BBQ////The sides are great. We had Mac n' Cheese, Brisket Chili and Cornbread. The Slaw comes with the meal, too. They were all awesome. Mac n' Cheese was very cheesy, creamy, and not overcooked like many establishments. The Brisket Chili is almost as good as mine (seriously that is awesome Chili). Heavy on the Brisket, light on the beans. The Cornbread was sweet and moist, and delicious. And now the Slaw. Normally I like creamy Slaw, but this Slaw was fabulous. Sweet vinegar with red onions and cabbage. Simple, and simply divine.
