Little Goat Diner////Now onto the food, since everyone was raving about the shrimp sandwich, and it looked phenomenal, we had to try it. It was delicious, not the best sandwich I've ever had, but it was certainly tasty. Fresh, huge shrimp, avocado, a tarty cabbage slaw, and masa chips. The only thing I didn't love is the potato bread, it was a little too hearty, I felt like a sourdough would have tasted better, but otherwise, the flavors were truly awesome. My hubby had the goat chilli which I had a taste of and it was yummy, loaded with goat even though I'm not a fan of chilli, he really seemed to enjoy it. I also got the tomato soup with apple in it and it was, and I kid you not, one of the best creamy version of a tomato soup that I've ever had. I couldn't really taste the apple in it, but it was super tasty and the bread that came with it, oh to die for...I think it was their sourdough, you must try it!
