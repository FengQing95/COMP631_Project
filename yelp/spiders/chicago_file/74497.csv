Little Goat Diner////A lot of people in my party ordered traditional breakfast but the menu is something you have to experience. It's Asian inspired american breakfast. Consider me floored. I got the Parathas Burrito (indian flatbread . sunny side eggs . avocado-bean salad . chili pepper sauce . sheep's milk cheddar). Changed my life! It was outside of my comfort zone but I took a chance and was thrilled. It was delicious! Make a point to give this place a try and order something that sounds good that you normally may not eat. You will not regret it.
