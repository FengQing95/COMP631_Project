Smoque BBQ////Between the two of us, we ordered a pulled pork sandwich, a half rack of St. Louis ribs, and a tasting portion of the brisket. Our sides were baked beans (which we both agreed were the best thing we ate) and macaroni and cheese. I thought the pulled pork was absolutely fantastic. One note on the macaroni--you can get a small (one aluminum tin) or large (two aluminum tins, aka the large is twice the size as the small). The small is what comes with the entrees. So, if you're getting one of the sandwiches, it's actually more advantageous to order the sandwich a la carte and then a large macaroni on the side. It's much more macaroni bang for your buck (and yes, it's delicious).
