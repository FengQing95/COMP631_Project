Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////THE Place for true Chicago deep dish. So good we order a coiple boxes of product delivered all the way to Birginia just in time for football season every year. The salad dressing is distressingly addictive to the point where panic sets in when the ladt bottle is opened and you are unsure of whether it will last until the next shipment. All a must for every NFL season. Bear Down!!
