Little Goat Diner////A visit to a big town hospital isn't typically a fun experience, so I thought I'd start the day off with a little Chicago bite to eat before hitting the hospital. Â WOW! Have you heard of this place? Despite the place being packed on a Tuesday morning, I got the perfect spot in the middle of it all. The hostess offered me options so I could work a bit while I waited and I was very appreciative.
