Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The homemade corned beef hash was unappetizing and gave me a really bad case of food poisoning. 24 hours later and I am still trying to recover from it. My boyfriend got the classic eggs benedict and it was nothing special. I would stick with the sweet breakfast options as the berry pancakes were tasty.
