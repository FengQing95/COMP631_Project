Smoque BBQ////The baby back ribs are amazing and the rub is so tasty that the sauce is really not even necessary but is still wonderful.  The chopped and sliced brisket sandwhiches are to die for and the maccaroni and cheese side is some of the best I have ever tasted.  It is BYOB, which is another plus and aside from the long lines it is a perfect dinner.
