Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Lastly, we tried the whisky ice cream for dessert with a side of hot fudge. It came with two scoops, which was a lot since my bf isn't a huge fan of sweets. But the unique flavor was well worth the try, even tastier with a drizzle of the chocolate fudge. We overall had an amazing dinner here and it was all worth the price! Would love to come again and explore more of the menu and cocktails
