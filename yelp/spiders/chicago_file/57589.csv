Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The gripes that  I have were with the libation portion of the meal. The water was served lukewarm & the sangria was extremely watered down due to the heavy dose of ice. Most of the dishes we tried were good with the exception of the "sausage rice". It had no flavor & tasted no different than any typical fried rice. We started with the "pintxos platter" & while everything was virtually bite sized it was tasty. The "shrimp & grits" wasn't the tastiest version of the dish but I've had far worse. The chicken sausage was pretty damn good but get maybe two servings if you're hungry. The eggs Benedict with Serrano ham was good however the first time I had real "jamón serrano" I remember being wowed by the flavor however that wasn't my experience here. The highlight of my meal was definitely the "sweet sherry flight" as I love aperitifs as well as digestifs. The prices are fair but to get a hefty meal you'll spend quite a lot. On this Sunday morning parking was free.
