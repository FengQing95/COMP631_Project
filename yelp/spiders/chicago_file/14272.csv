Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The buttercrust is totally necessary.  Keep the pizza simple ... with a pound of cheese a lot of toppings can be overpowering.  And, for God's sake, order the chocolate chip cookie pizza.  I dream of this cookie (and I don't really like desserts)...when I eat it, I feel like I'm in one of those many commercials that show an oooey gooey irresistible cookie.
