Little Goat Diner////With the little misstep noted above, my friend asked if we could meet Stephanie. Now I've seen her the three times I've been to Girl & a Goat, at Baconfest the past couple years and one other food fest...but I've never had any real 1 on 1 interaction because I'm such a nervous dork about cheflebrities. She was very nice and we truly appreciated her stepping away from the kitchen for us! She even let us take a pic with her...so sweet! We also took a pic with the manager because he was such a nice fella.
