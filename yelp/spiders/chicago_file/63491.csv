Smoque BBQ////When you walk in you are greeted with a sign telling you how the process of ordering works and they describe how their ribs are like meat jello which fall off the bone.    Well, my rib meat didn't exactly 'Fall off the bone' and they were some of the driest ribs I have ever put in my mouth. The rub on the ribs was lacking in flavor and could have used a bit more salt.  Also, the smoke flavor on the ribs and brisket was lacking this could be that they are cooking the ribs at a higher temp.  I can usually crush a half slab of ribs pretty easily, but I could only eat half of the half slab.
