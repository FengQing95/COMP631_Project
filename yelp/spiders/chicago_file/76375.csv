Little Goat Diner////On the other hand, my fiance, the play it safe guy, got the shrimp and grits. Holy smokes! I'm not a true southern girl so I never understood the draw to grits (tastes like even shittier oatmeal), but these were flavored grits. The dish was bursting with flavor, so being the good girlfriend that I am, I pushed my dish aside and helped my fiance finish his. If I could tastefully lick the plate, I would've, but it was my 29th birthday weekend, so I was trying to keep it classy.
