Little Goat Diner////Amazing! Â The server was fun and attentive, very knowledgeable about the menu. The food was delicious and quick. I highly recommend the crumpets. My Australian husband was skeptical and then blown away! Consider making a reservation by we got in right away while others had to wait quite some time. Such a fun atmosphere.
