Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////2. Realize they build their pizza with the sauce on top with no cheese to swaddle it - and it's  - essentially seasoned crushed tomatoes that are fresh and delicious but VERY JUICY.  So once you get the pizza - slide it into the oven for about another 10 minutes and that juice should evaporate or settle into the pizza.  If you're in a hunger delirium take 2 paper towels and gently lay them flat on the pizza - DON'T BLOT it - just lay it on the pizza and tap the towels a little and  the extra juice will absorb enough to make it puddle free.
