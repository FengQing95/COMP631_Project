Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////There were four of us with Friday night reservations made in advance.  We all arrived 5 minutes before the time and were told we would not be seated until it was exactly our reservation time.  Stood at a crowded bar (no seats) for over 45 minutes without the hostesss staff coming over at all.  We kept checking and after it hit 30 minutes and finally, the hostess came to seat us.  Unfortunately, they do not transfer your bar bill so she left us while we settled up.  We then had to go track her down and were escorted to the least desirable table right in front of the door.  Based on our surprise and comments, we were moved to a different (not great) table about 10 minutes later.
