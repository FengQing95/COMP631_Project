Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Anyhoo, we ordered the beef tounge, bacon for our appetizers, the bacon was ok, but incredibly underwhelming. It was not thick cut, flavors was missing and,  as  explained to NY wife, her bacon is 100 x better. You can get a much superior bacon at Au Cheval, now that's some great bacon. The beef tongue was indeed very tender but I was not impressed with the flavor, maybe an off night for the staff or maybe most yelp reviews lack a sophisticated palate, you no se!
