Little Goat Diner////It's a great looking diner, but that's just it. I am surprised by the high accolades from most of the yelp reviewers. When you try to do too much, it is usually at a cost. Nothing I ate here was noteworthy (and I gave it a second shot). All this place has is the Chef behind its name, no substance.
