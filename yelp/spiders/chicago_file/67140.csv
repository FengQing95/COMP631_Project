Little Goat Diner////+Of the Bulls Eye French Toast, the Los Drowned or the Mac n' cheese, which was best? Â Mac n' cheese - and I think that says something when the side dish is better than the entrees. The french toast and chicken were cooked fine, but the egg inside the toast, not so much. It was so runny the egg white was still clear around the yolk. I showed my neighbor as we sat in the community table and he hoped for my benefit that the egg was from a reputable source (I'm pretty sure it was, like 95.8% sure...eeek?). Also, there seemed to be a smidge of curry I think in the batter, which I didn't mind. The Los Drowned was a good sammy, like a French dip with cheese, avocado, and mashed up black beans on the bottom and au jus to dunk in. The mac n' cheese was creamy and sharp, it tasted like it might have had goat cheese in it. As we later found out in talking to our neighbors, it seemed each of the items they had (the dudes to my left had onion rings and fried pickles, and the guys to my right had hash browns with a fried egg) that one or another of their items have either curry or goat cheese. I sense a theme?
