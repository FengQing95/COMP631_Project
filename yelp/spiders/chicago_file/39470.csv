Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My wife and I recently had a phenomenal dinner at Bavette's. I booked a reservation about a month and a half in advance and could only find availability for 10pm or later for Friday or Saturday night. We booked a late Friday night reservation. Upon entering the restaurant we loved the dimly lit speakeasy ambiance. The drink menu was extensive featuring a nice selection of mixed drinks, liquors and wines. I ordered a glass of cabernet. Shortly after our drinks came we were also given two free glasses of wine. Apparently, if you bring your own bottle of wine to the restaurant, you may share a glass of wine from the bottle with another table in lieu of paying a corkage fee. We were the lucky table to get two of those glasses. For food I ordered the Filet Mignon - Petite Duchess Cut with Gorgonzola. This was one of the best steaks I have ever had! The steak was tender, juicy, cooked a perfect medium-rare, and was topped with a rich and flavorful Gorgonzola topping. For sides we ordered the Truffle Mac & Cheese and the Brussels Sprouts and were also given complimentary Creamed Spinach. The Mac & Cheese was addictive: rich with nicely gooey white cheddar cheese. The Brussels Sprouts were nicely charred, tender and topped with flavorful parmesan. The Creamed Spinach was filled with melty rich blue cheese. We were stuffed by the end of this and indicated we didn't have room for dessert. Our server convinced us otherwise by describing the Chocolate Cream Pie. We were glad we gave in because this pie is what dreams are made of! The chocolate was rich and decadent and sat on a crunchy oreo crust. The heavenly whip topping was creamy and airy. This was one of the best desserts I have ever had. Overall the food, ambiance, and service were superb. Bavette's is now one of my favorite steakhouses and I will make it a priority to visit again next time I'm in Chicago.
