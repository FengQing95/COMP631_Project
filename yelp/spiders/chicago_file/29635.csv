Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time to try this dipped pizza, it was delicious but the line was super long. We waited almost 2h, finally got a table. Ordered salad, it was a great value. Good taste as well. Personally I think the pizza was too fatty, lots of flours, prefer thin crust pizza better. Ordered a Margarita, was awful, asked waitress to change to another drink, in general restaurant would cross this order from the check but they didn't and didn't tell us clearly either. Well, be aware of the service.
