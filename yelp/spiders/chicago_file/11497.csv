Art Institute of Chicago////We ended up buying a package so we could see 4 different places in chicago. This was such a good deal and great idea because we did not have to stand oitside while it was raining.  We got to immediately walk through instead of waiting in line to purchase tickets. All we had to do was go to the front desk and have them scan our cards.  Perfect!
