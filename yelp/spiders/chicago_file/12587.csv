Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We are from Philadelphia and we usually leave at least a 20% tip. Needless to say, we did not leave a tip. I have never been so angry leaving a restaurant. There was some concern that the server would think we were cheap for not leaving a tip. However the experience was so horrible, a tip was just not justified. In our party of eight, four of us own our own restaurants in Philadelphia. We certainly understand that mishaps happen sometimes, but we train our employees and servers to take care of the customers-always. With today's many business review websites, an unhappy customer can easily post a negative review and spread his story of his/her bad experience across the web. I want our server Matt to read this and the reviews I will post. The experience was embarassing for your restaurant and for me since I had to explain our situation to the manager while other customers were there.
