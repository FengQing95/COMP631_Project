Art Institute of Chicago////This is an incredible art museum! I spent three hours there last night and I feel like I barely scratched the surface. The interior design is amazing, the museum is well organized (I would have been so lost without the map and help of the curators), and the collections are so expansive. Also, the museum is so clean! The floors and walls are spotless. Particularly loved the Impressionism exhibit as well as seeing so many of Monet's works. I really appreciated that the museum has a free app with a ton of guided tours if you want some structure looking around. I started with the museum essentials tour to get the foundation and see the classics, but I'd love to go back to look at some lesser-known works of art in more depth and detail.
