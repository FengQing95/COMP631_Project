Art Institute of Chicago////An absolutely wonderful museum and I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Chicago. I had to decide between the Field Museum, the Shedd Aquarium and the Art Institute and ultimately chose the Art Institute because I thought it probably had something unique that I wouldn't be able to see elsewhere. It definitely delivered in that respect and hopefully someday I'll be back to see all the things I didn't get a chance to this time.
