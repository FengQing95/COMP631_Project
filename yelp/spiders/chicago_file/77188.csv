Little Goat Diner////I'm writing regarding my experience on July 20, 2019. Â I loved the shrimp dish and the Caesar salad; however, I found the service poor. Our server was Caroline who didn't put in our appetizer order and rather than apologizing, she assured us it was coming up and that the naan is made to order. When our entrees arrived before the appetizer, we asked to cancel the order to the dismay of other serving staff. One of the staff came to ask us if we were sure about canceling the appetizer because I guess caused a ruckus.
