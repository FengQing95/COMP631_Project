Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Came in for my boyfriends birthday and had reservations downstairs in the Parlor. The check in process was super easy we waited for a few moments and then were taken downstairs. As we walked through the main dining room I think I may have enjoyed eating there a bit more then the parlor but the parlor was still great ( I was just NOT a fan of our table the chair was crazy uncomfortable and made for someone who is 5'2).
