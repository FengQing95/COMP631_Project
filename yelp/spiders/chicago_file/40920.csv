Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////my go-to tapas spot in the city is cafe iberico. i'd heard lots of great things about ba-ba-reeba, so i was eager to check it out. i like the ambience. i think it's very fun for a group or a date. when i went, we had the passion fruit sangria. it was fine, but didn't taste like there was any liquor in it. i would have to taste their other sangrias to be fair, but on this count, cafe iberico is my preferred choice. the tapas we had were tasty and the desserts, as well. our waiter was great. i would definitely be willing to come back.
