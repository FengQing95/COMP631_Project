Smoque BBQ////Smoque is a Chicago staple. It's hard not to come here every week. The food is amazing. My girlfriend and I always get the St Louis Rib platter and it's enough for both of us to waddle away smiling. The sides are a bit small with the exception of the fries. The fries come in a sizable bag and it's more than enough for two people. Service is fast and polite. One of the owners hangs around sometimes but he's cool and just wants everyone to have a good time.
