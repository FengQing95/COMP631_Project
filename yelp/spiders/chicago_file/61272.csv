Smoque BBQ////I must say last weekend I went back after a good 6-8 month break and it was fantastic. Everything was spot on and on point. St. Louis ribs and pulled pork were fantastic. The rub and smoke had the perfect balance. The ribs were moist and not over cooked. Pulled pork had excellent flavor and was moist. Hands down the best bbq meal I have ever had. I have been out east and southwest (including Texas) and this was the winner hands down.
