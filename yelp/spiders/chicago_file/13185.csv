Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came here before the Phillies - Cubs game last July. We arrived just before 11 am and waited for them to open. Once they did, it wasn't a problem to get a table. Deep dish is the way to go and you can't go wrong here. Quite simply put, the buttery crust is amazing and IMHO better than Giordano's!
