Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For 3 people, we ordered the thick crust medium size "Lou" (2 slices/person) which was piled up with fresh vegetables that were cooked only slightly so they still held their form. The crust was super crunchy and honestly, the highlight of the pie. After about 1 slice, we all felt so full. One of my friends decided to take her other slice to-go and my other friend and I decided to tough it out and finish it.
