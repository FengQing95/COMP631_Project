Smoque BBQ////While I will concur it is the best in Chicago, I still think it is just good, not great.  The brisket is amazlingly tender, melt in your mouth, goodness.  It's a sin in my mind to even consider ordering it chopped because of the tenderness.  The memphis BBQ sauce is my favorite.  Carolina BBQ is too vinegary for me, and I'm glad Smoque gives you one of each to decide.  The baby back ribs had great BBQ flavor from the rub, however they were dry, which was disappointing for me considering I had a taste for ribs.
