Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba was honestly amazing. There are so many great restaurants in the city that it's hard to keep returning to the same one but I'll be back again and again. I visited during a Wednesday evening and took advantage of their happy hour special. Although, the happy hour menu has limited options on it, they are all a hit. Meatballs, amazing. Chicken and ham croquettes, so good! Even the bacon wrapped date, which I expected not to like was tasty. I will say, I think the food significantly surpassed the service. Someone else described it as "somewhat attentive but doesn't look like happy to see us" and I understand why they would say that. I almost felt like we were bothering him by sitting in his section and placing an order. However, the food was so good I could honestly not care less about the server's demeanor.
