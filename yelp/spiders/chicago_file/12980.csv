Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you want awesome Chicago style deep dish, you will have a hard time finding a better place than this.  Absolutely incredible deep dish pizza.  The sauce has a sweetness to it that other deep dish pizza places in Chicago don't have.  I usually order straight up cheese, because that's just how I like my deep dish.  You can also put your order in as soon as you arrive, so by the time you sit down, it shouldn't be too long until you can devour your delicious pizza.  Pretty cool decor as well, with Chicago sports memorabilia all over.
