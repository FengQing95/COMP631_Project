Little Goat Diner////I would recommend making reservations as it can get crowded even on weekdays. But 45 minutes went by pretty fast and we were seated inside. The restaurant is absolutely gorgeous - almost as gorgeous as the food. Since we had assumed the restaurant was closed, we ate somewhere else prior to this, so we weren't really hungry. My boyfriend and I ended up splitting a meal because we HAD to try the food. We ordered the This Little Piggy Went to China and a side of hash browns (both came recommended by our waiter). The meal was as equally delicious as it was nice to look at. The scallion cheddar biscuit was out of this world and the smoked blue berries brought the entire dish up a level. Hashbrowns were cooked with cheese and were also very tasty.
