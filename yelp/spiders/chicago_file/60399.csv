Smoque BBQ////Being a bbq fiend and a certified bbq judge, I had to seek out some barbeque during my Chicago trip.  Due to my limited time frame, I was only able to hit up one spot and I decided on Smoque after a good bit of research.  I got up early for the sole purpose of hitting up Smoque even though it was way out of the way (I used 3 modes of transportation to get there - very rare for an Atlantan). I managed to arrive a little bit after they opened and beat the crowds.
