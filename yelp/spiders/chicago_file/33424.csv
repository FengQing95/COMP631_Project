Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////1. The worst moment...my husband ordered his steak (the $60 rib eye recommended by our server) "medium rare" (which is also what our server recommended).  The steak arrived well done.  Our server didn't check back right away, but after frantically waving at other employees, she came to our table. We showed her the black meat. She said, "I'll have to check with the chef.  It could be rarer in the center."
