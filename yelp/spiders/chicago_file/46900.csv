Smoque BBQ////amazing.  seriously, there must be crack in that sauce.  when they first moved in, my family gave them a try.  i kid you not that we were all pretty impressed by the food, but only mildly so when it came to the sauce.  and then... well, now i cant have enough of the sauce.  i plunge my sammiches into it, so good.  the food is great.  juicy, delicious, and even the fat which i usually take off was too good not to eat - melts in your mouth.  oh, and the sides?  no wonder there's lines out the door on a regular basis.  we've even been told on several occasions that we cant order the food we want (for pick-up) bc they're all out (they've gotten better about having enough, but sometimes, you cant predict the mass amounts of people that show up... ) these guys are good!!  and, they're a pleasure to deal w; just about every time i've come there, the owner (or one of them) is always there.  i think thats the sign of someone who cares.  may be pricey, but def worth it!
