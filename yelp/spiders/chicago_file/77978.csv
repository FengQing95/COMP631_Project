Little Goat Diner////Made reservations very easily on open table. Got seated right away. Ordered the bullseye French toast, this little piggy went to china, and then had brown. They were all so good. The bullseye French toast is sweet but loaded with crispy fried chicken and the toast is filled with a runny egg which was a pleasant surprise. The strawberries also add another sweet but fresh flavor to the dish. The French toast is huge so I recommend you share! Then the this little piggy went to china was very savory. I remember it being a little salty and oily but it was still really good. I probably wouldn't get it the next time
