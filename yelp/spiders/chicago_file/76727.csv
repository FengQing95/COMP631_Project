Little Goat Diner////This was such a cool place to try as our last restaurant in Chicago! It's very cute looking inside, with a very modern diner feel. The menu had a lot of classics that had the little goat twist: I had the shrimp and cheesy grits that had pistachios and tomatoes, my friend had the little goat latte that had goat's milk in it, and we all shared the cheez-it sundae (very unique and tasty)! In the back, they have a bar and a cafe and an are that has their merch like t-shirts and signature spices, which I thought was very cool. If you're visiting Chicago, definitely give this place a try, and make a reservation like we did so you don't have to wait in line.
