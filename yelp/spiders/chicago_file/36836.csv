Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Long, long, wait for food and then when it finally arrived it was not hot and under cooked! Rare instead of medium well! Waiter was awesome and responsive! However, Â nothing was taken off our bill! We ordered a drink from the bar we never received! One of us got to wait for our meal to be cooked more which is disappointing! In a city of endless awesome steak houses we will try another one next time!
