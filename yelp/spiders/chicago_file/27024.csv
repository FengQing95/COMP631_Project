Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We started with a house salad. Plenty for 2 but can be shared by 3.  The pizza was worth the wait.  The crust was so much better. We got the Lou's Chicago which had a crispy, buttery crust ( I really couldn't taste that much butter) with sausage and delicious tomato sauce topping. The small was more than enough for us and we even had a slice to take back.  This is one of the best deep dish pizzas I've tried.
