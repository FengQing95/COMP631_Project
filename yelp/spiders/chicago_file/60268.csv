Smoque BBQ////We get there and just manage to beat the rush and ordered our dinners.  Immediately I recognized the guy that was on TV telling the host how they do their beans, brisket rub, ribs etc and things were smelling wonderfully.  I was greeted by the nice lady at the counter who took my order of chopped brisket, mac and cheese, slaw, beans and a taste of the pulled pork.  The taste option is pretty cool, I should have gotten a taste of everything but I didn't want to over stuff myself and ruin my experience at Smoque.
