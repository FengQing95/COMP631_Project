The Purple Pig////Instead of jamón ibérico (a personal fave), my mom opted for 'guanciale' which is the fatty sibling of prosciutto.  Accompanying that was a firmer, milder blue cheese (when compared to your typical Stilton or Roquefort) as well as crispy pita triangles, sweet-brined cornichon pickles and a delightful fig mostarda.
