Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My recommendation is to bring a cart or small basket to your dinner and take plates and plates of their corn dish home with you [Elote Style Corn chili, lime, parmesan] it is incredible.  We sampled their Filet as well which was cooked to a sensational medium rare and had phenomenal seasonings.  A true testament to the menu were the fantastic sauces that accessorized each dish, particularly the Garlic Shrimp.
