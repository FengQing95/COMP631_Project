Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I ordered a chicken salad sandwich and the white bread was stale. They tried their best to make it right by bringing me another sandwich, but that bread was stale also. The salad itself was not very well seasoned, but they do give you a large portion - which is why I think many people go.
