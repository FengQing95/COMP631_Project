The Purple Pig////We ordered the tuna tartar and the turkey leg as well as goat cheesecake and they were delicious! The tuna tartar was the best I've ever had. The turkey leg was so juicy and tender and it came off the bone so easily - it was just a bit too oily for us but it was still quite flavorful. This is the first goat cheesecake I've had and I absolutely loved it - it went perfectly with the ice cream; soooo yummy!
