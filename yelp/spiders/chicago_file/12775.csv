Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////In Chicago for a convention. Asked a waitress at a bar where we went for lunch about where to get Chicago pie and she said go to Malnati's. Long wait outside in the cold, but you get updates about where you are in line, the crowd outside is pretty friendly, and it didn't take too long. They start cooking your pie while you wait, so once we sat down I think it was out in about 15 minutes, right after salad. I haven't had a lot of Chicago pizza, but I really liked this stuff a lot. It was huge, you know, like a pizza casserole, but I have to say, the crust was surprisingly delicate and the flavors were all really well balanced. It looked like it was going to be just a big cheesy mess and it was-in the best possible way, but it wasn't over the top goop. Turned out to be a great night, sitting there having family style pizza with my coworkers and taking in the atmosphere of the place. I would definitely go here again. Very highly recommended.
