Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////about 5 min after we sat, the manager came over. he must have been informed of our grumblings. he apologized greatly for the delay in our seating and for our less than ideal table. he offered to close the tent roof a bit and pump a little heat in. he was just so nice and genuine that we were all reset and started fresh. the closed tent and heat made a huge difference. also, when we got the bill, he had taken $20 off. really great handling of customers. they definitely redeemed themselves. all I ever want is for a restaurant to recognize the problems and handle them. the money off was just super nice icing on the cake.
