Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered Lou Malnati's on a Sunday evening for dinner. We placed our order at 5:30pm and was able to pick it up at 6:30pm. We ordered a small deep dish with butter crust, sausage pieces, pepperoni, mushrooms, and olives. We also ordered the Malnati's salad. The pizza was wonderful and was able to feed my husband and I with NO LEFTOVERS. I would highly recommend ordering takeout/delivery if you do not care to sit in the restaurant. To eat there, it can be a 2+ hour experience. The salad is the only reason we are giving the restaurant 4 stars and it is completely out of personal taste. The salad was unexpectedly sweet and not a classic Italian salad. All together, we would go back but order a different salad.
