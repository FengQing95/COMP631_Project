The Purple Pig////This place had by far the best Grilled Octopus dish I've ever tasted. It comes with fingerling potatoes, green beans, and a delicious salsa verde, which adds a herb-y/citrus-y flavor to complement the slight char and savory flavor in the octopus. The texture was also perfect - soft and meaty, without being rubbery or slimey. It was perfectly executed and the portion was just right.
