Art Institute of Chicago////This Grande Dame on the lakefront is getting a fabulous new jewel in her tiara.  A Renzo Piano-designed addition is going up as we speak, but even amidst gallery shuffles to accomodate construction, visitors are still treated to a stunning and comprehensive collection of European, American, Asian, and African art.  Some of my favorite Cezannes can be viewed all together here, along with one of my favorite pieces of all time, a Gauguin portrait that includes, as the ground, a loving and reverent rendering of a Cezanne still life that Gauguin owned.
