Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We arrived a little before 5 PM and were seated right away. I feel like the lasagna came out a little cool, but for my son it was the perfect temperature. The salad came put promptly and the house red wine vinaigrette was really tasty. Â We ordered the Lou and should have looked closer at the ingredient list, no sauce. It was still pretty good. There are benches for people who are waiting to be seated, which they were when we left. The ladies restroom only has one stall.
