Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////From the time we sat down the service was sub-par. The waiter came to our table and asked for our drink order along with a "I will get you each a glass of water and come back". Almost 10 minutes later and he approached our table again to ask if we would like to order an appetizer and once again promised us the glasses of water which he had yet to supply up to that point. We told him that we didn't want any appetizers and that we were ready to order. He seemed flustered as he fumbled for his notepad and pen. I had to repeat our pizza order multiple times SLOWLY for him to write it down. When he FINALLY returned with our glasses of water, we told him that we would like to order the spinach salad and garlic bread which once again seemed to fluster him as he fumbled again to write the two items down on his notepad.
