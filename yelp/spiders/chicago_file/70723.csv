Little Goat Diner////Never had Goat Chili before and this is the best chili we ever had!!  Trust me, I've had my share of chili. Had the braised beef sandwich , can't remember the name of it but it was spectacular!   If you go to the bakery area, there's a bar we sat at. Had the Summer Crush cocktail- Delicious!  Definitely coming back!
