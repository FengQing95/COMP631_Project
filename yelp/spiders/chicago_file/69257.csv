Little Goat Diner////Four out of five stars because it's a little bit pricey for diner-style food (that day's "blue plate special" was $22). I wouldn't eat here all the time, but definitely worth the splurge once in a while. I can't wait to go back and try some of the other items - everything looked delicious!
