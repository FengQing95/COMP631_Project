Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time here wasn't for sure what was going on the place was packed. We did call ahead made reservations. I'm glad we did it because there's like a two hour wait. When we got seated I was asked if we ordered a pizza ready. I didn't know anything about that but if you do go there make sure you order ahead so when you do get seated your pizza Will be out shortly. So when we ordered he said it will be a 45 minute wait only took 30 minutes. We order minestrone soup that came out Luke warm but had a good flavor to it. Then we ordered a small pizza Chicago style first time ever having it. It was really good the sausage on it was home made it had a great flavor. I would go back again.
