Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've been wanting to try Bavette's for ages now and finally did last night. I must say it lived up to the hype!! Everything was spot on! The vibe was wonderful with intimate decor, perfect for a date night. Our server was attentive and super helpful as we decided drinks and entrees. We ordered a little bit of everything, but the baked goat cheese appetizer, roasted chicken, brussel sprouts and truffle mac and cheese were major hits!! I definitely plan to come back soon and can't wait to try more during the next visit!
