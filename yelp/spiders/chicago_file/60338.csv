Smoque BBQ////Soooo, a group of friends decided to celebrate a birthday here on a Saturday night.  Not the best idea since that is when this place is most busy!  We arrived to find a line outside of Smoque and half way down the block!  Good sign since that means it's loved; bad sign since we have to wait in that line.
