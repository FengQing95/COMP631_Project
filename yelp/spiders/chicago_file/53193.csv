Smoque BBQ////I was taken to this place the mothers day weekend. my nephew treated my friend and I . when we parked the smell of bbq was in the air. As we entered and saw the line we all looked at each other. Â I DONT HAVE PATIENCE. But not to worry line moved fast because they have alot workers behind the counter. Took no more then. 10 minutes to order., you sit yourself down . When your name is called foods ready and on trays. We all order the 1/2 slab baby back ribs for$15.95. with/slaw and 2 sides. The cole slaw was okay. Loved the mac and cheese but portion was small. But order of fries was huge. one word of warning DO NOT wear light top cause you will end up with sauce all over it. The ribs were very tender fall of the bone. They have plenty of chairs inside and outside. There are a couple of young man standing in front with a rag and spray bottle. As soon as someone finishes they will take your tray and wipe table. There are people coming in to pick up orders. This place is like an assembly line, everything is moving as it should be. would I go back ? For sure. or i will phone in order.
