Little Goat Diner////To eat, I went with the tonkatsu, a breaded pork cutlet sandwich with asian BBQ sauce, mayo, and cabbage served on white bread.  I should point out it was really good quality white bread.  It may look like the store-bought stuff but it was good.  The sandwich is also enormous, it's basically 2 full sandwiches, I highly recommend sharing.  And, I highly recommend ordering this.  It was excellent, the pork is crispy but not greasy and was not dried out.  The sauces were complementary but didn't overtake the sandwich.  The bread held up its end of the bargain and the entire thing didn't fall apart.  It was just a really good sandwich, one of the better things I ate during my 5 days in Chicago.
