Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Went to Alinea the evening prior and actually preferred this meal at a third of the price.  The bartender on the top floor was a bit rude and cold though.  We were scared to ask questions because she was so short with us.  We had dinner downstairs and the ambiance was unreal--my husband was shazaming every tune and our server was incredible.  He didn't miss a beat.  Food was so flavorful.  Michilin stars are a joke--merit should be given to restaurants most revisited.  Our friend who dined with us had been to Bavette's countless times.  And we'll be back when we're back in Chicago.  Alinea..not so much.
