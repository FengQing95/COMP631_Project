Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time in Chicago, so I came to Lou Malnati's looking for an authentic Chicago deep dish pizza.  We ordered the "Lou" (spinach, mushroom, tomato & cheese pizza).  The pizza here takes 35 minutes to bake, so we ordered some other things to pass the time.  I didn't care for the cocktail sauce that was served with the calamari, also the batter wasn't light & crispy.  I was surprised when the pizza came out that it wasn't as stuffed or thick as I was expecting.  The crust wasn't doughy, more crunchy like toast & buttery.  The filling was a little runny, probably from the fresh spinach & tomatoes.  Overall, not very flavorful.
