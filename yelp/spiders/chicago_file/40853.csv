Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is great! My friend took me here for my 21st birthday, where I had my first strawberry mojito-- delicious. The service was good, the food was good, and I'm a big fan of tapas, so I would know good tapas when I taste it. I especially loved the goat cheese with marinara sauce and olive oiled bread (which is a must-have at all tapas bars), the beef steak with blue cheese, and lamb with couscous. I don't suggest getting the croquettas though (ONE WORD: eww). This place can get pretty crowded though, but it wasn't bad when I went there. The bill turned out to be pretty heavy, and I honestly didn't feel like I ate all that much, but that's okay... I had a fabulous time.
