Art Institute of Chicago////If you are a Chicago resident, another way to get here free on any day is to obtain a free Museum Pass from a Chicago public library. They are like gold and realllllly difficult to get a hold of, but they are good for you and up to 4 people to enter for free for a week! The libraries have passes for all the museums in Chicagoland and some other hot spots like Brookfield Zoo too!
