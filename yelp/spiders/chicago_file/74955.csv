Little Goat Diner////Confession: I'm a big fan of all things Steph Izzard and Alex Bachman, but that's only because they nail it EVERY time. Little Goat is no exception. We'd been trying to get here for a long time and the right time presented itself today... FINALLY. She set out to bring her take on a diner and she nailed it. The menu is bigger than her menus usually are (typical for diners), has typical diner fare done remarkably well (including milkshakes and sandwiches), and is the right price point for the food and neighborhood. We got the bread of the day to start which was spot-on. Then I had the killer tuna melt... so very nom nom nom. We also got the mac n cheese which was a great side to share for 3-4 people.
