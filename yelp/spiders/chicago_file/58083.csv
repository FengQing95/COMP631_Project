Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Had the most fun family dinner here! Lively (though cramped) atmosphere, so you will have a good time.  We loved the sangria.  For food, our party of 4 shared a variety of small plates.  They also serve divine table bread to nosh on while waiting for your next dish.  I love this place because you can get a variety of dishes so that everyone is happy.  Be prepared to share !
