Art Institute of Chicago////This rating is not for the quality of the museum itself, as the Art Institute is a world renowned museum.  The one star is for the poor service provided on a busy holiday weekend.  As my boyfriend and I approached the museum on Michigan Avenue, we immediately noticed the long line to get in.  We planned to grab a hot cocoa and wait it out when we saw a museum docent assisting other visitors.  We explained that we had purchased one ticket and needed to get a teacher's pass after completing the educator discount application online.  The docent directed us to enter through the membership door.  After waiting for 15 or 20 minutes a young woman asked us if we needed help.  We explained that we were waiting to secure a teacher's pass and she said we needed to go through the main ticket line.  We shared that the docent outside had sent us inside to procure our additional ticket, and she said she was sorry - we would need to return to the general admission line to enter the museum. This after moments earlier she had offered to help another visitor who was also in the wrong line. When given the choice between helping us and not helping us after one of the other museum staffers clearly sent us on a wild goose chase (yielding no geese) she chose not to help us.  At a world class museum, I expected that we would receive world-class service, but sadly what we experienced was sub-par at best.
