Little Goat Diner////I don't know it it was because we were obviously tourists and they preferred safe, and frequent customers (which would be a dumb, because we are often in Chicago) or just plain mistake. I just can say it was very annoying (plus imagine having your 86 year old grandma and teenage sister waiting for 45 min, after having walked all day).
