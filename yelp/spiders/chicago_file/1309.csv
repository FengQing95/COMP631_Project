Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Let's break that down. It's a thin slice of cake. Then they fry it. They smear that with cream cheese icing (yessssss) and then top that with another slice of fried cake. And then they take three of these little pancreas busters and put them all on one plate. And then they serve it with syrup (which I did not use, for the record). But frankly, I find them bland until you sprinkle sugar on top of them. Pretty darn tasty. Its in the upper echelon of breakfast places, based on my one visit, but it's not quite in to 4 star territory. Service is fine, prices are on the high side (but look at the location, why do I even bring it up).
