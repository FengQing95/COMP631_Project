Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////our waiter was extremely friendly and answered all the questions we had. we ordered a Lou's deep dish, and since my boyfriend is gluten free, they offered a standard 10'' gluten free pizza, or they revealed to us a CRUSTLESS PIZZA, where sausages ARE the crust!!! I had no idea how that would work, but we were about to find out! Â pizzas come in the size of small, medium, large, and extra large. our waiter warned us that the crustless pizza is some heavy stuff, and that a medium size would be a hike, but the large would be a trek... so we went for the large!!
