Smoque BBQ////But seriously - seriously - What is up with the jail-looking, prison-issueish, quasi-thali-esque presentation of the food here? Tin tray , lined with wax paper, meat lumped directly on that paper? Like the paper is the plate? And then tiny little tin muffin tins of sides. Is that supposed to be "authentic"? Authentic what? (-sigh-I probably really don't want to know, do I?) Look, I've lived in multiple areas of the south, and they do have themselves a lot of fucking problems, but they do (for the most part) use plates.
