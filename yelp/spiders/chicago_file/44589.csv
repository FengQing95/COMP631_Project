Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My friend SWEARS by this place.  She loves the tapas and always comes here whenever she's in Chi-city.  Since we were a little too early to crash another friend's house party, we decided to descend on Ba-Ba-Reeba and give the ol' girl a shot.  We called for reservations for 6:30 but showed up about 5:45 and it was no problem to be seated right away.
