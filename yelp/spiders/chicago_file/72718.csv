Little Goat Diner////Went to Little Goat during my lunch break with 3 coworkers. The service was really great/friendly and the food didn't take long to arrive. I got the Sloppy Goat and it was absolutely delicious. I don't know if I've had a better sandwich before. However, it didn't come with any sides so make sure to order a side if a sandwich will not fill you. I will be going again soon!
