Art Institute of Chicago//// Â  It was cool to stand before the famed A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte as featured in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, even if I left my Red Wings jersey at home. It was even cooler to stand before Ivan Albright's A Picture of Dorian Gray, so gnarly it's almost like a fine art version of Basil Wolerton. You really get a sense ol' Dorian was an especially nasty character. And speaking of nasty Kathe Burkhart's portrait of Liz Taylor with the stencil block lettered legend "FUCK YOU" is not to be missed. (Hey, if it can be seen in a museum I can type it out on Yelp, right?) It's like punk rock Warhol.
