Little Goat Diner////I ordered the chickpea salad (modified for me), and it was SO SO good! I'm still getting used to not being able to eat like I used to so I was skeptical anything could be good without onion or garlic. At Little Goat, that's luckily not a problem! Little Goat continues to be one of my standby favorites in the West Loop area. Even though there are a lot of dining options in this area, I really appreciate the big menu, the location, the reservation availability, and the quality of food. I will 100% be back!
