Smoque BBQ////I've been going to Smoque since before it got famous, and it's never let me down. Easily the best BBQ on the northwest side. Even when the line is out the door, things move pretty fast. I think we usually wait about 15 minutes to get to the register and another 10 minutes for our food.
