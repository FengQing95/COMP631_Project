Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is my favorite deep dish chain out of the three main contenders in Chicago. I had the Lou's Classic which has a buttery crust and sausage. Delicious! Each piece is huge. I ordered a small by myself and could not finish it. Don't be fooled! Order a personal if it's just you. The restaurant offers some accurate guidance on how many people each size feeds.
