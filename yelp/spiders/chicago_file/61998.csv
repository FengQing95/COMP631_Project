Smoque BBQ////I will say that if you're thinking of carrying out, you may want to have realistic expectations. I've carried out 3-4 times and EVERY single time, the meat is too rare on the brisket. I feel like they may just save the rarer stuff for the to-go orders since most people don't check their food until they get home. I'm not say that's 100% the case, but it's hard for me to believe that my luck is THAT bad. That being said, I've never been any less than absolutely satisfied, when I dine in... hence the 5 star rating. I'd recommend this place to anyone living in Chicago who hasn't tried it, and anyone passing through (and I actually did. I had family in town from FL a few weeks ago and I told them to go. My uncle is VERY picky when it comes to food, and he said it was the best BBQ he's ever had in his LIFE!!!). Â :)
