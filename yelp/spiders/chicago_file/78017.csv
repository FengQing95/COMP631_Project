Little Goat Diner////First, you cant call in an order. The only way to "call in" an order for pickup is to download the worlds worst food reservation app "ritual" which idk about other people but the 3 times I have used ritual to order pickup my order was not made until I arrived and I had to wait another 20 minutes each time. This was extremely annoying and pointless for there to be an app in the first place. LITTLE GOAT IF YOU ARE LISTENING PLEASE LET CUSTOMERS CALL IN ORDERS.
