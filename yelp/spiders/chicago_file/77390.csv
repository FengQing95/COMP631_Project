Little Goat Diner////We have been here a few times and I seriously have never thought much of it. The last couple times there I was only appeasing to friends to meet them out. I don't like waiting long and then getting sat in a crowded table all jammed in with strangers at the same table. I feel everything is over priced and just not impressed. Sorry, not a fan.
