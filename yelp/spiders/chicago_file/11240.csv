Art Institute of Chicago////One serious issue I had is that it's not easy if you're handicapped or physically weak to visit this museum. I had badly sprained my knee before my trip and needed to take frequent breaks at the galleries, but there weren't enough benches available. When we wanted to check out another exhibit and it wasn't connected to the main building, it required going down, walking through entire sections of another building, walking through other exhibits, before finally getting there. The elevators are around, but really they should have some ramps instead of all these stairs. And they need a lot more benches. The dioramas had none and if you sit on the steps, security comes and tells you to stand up or sit outside.
