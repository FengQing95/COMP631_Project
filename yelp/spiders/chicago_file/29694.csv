Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was expecting rainbows & unicorns explosion in my mouth based in how popular this place was.. Well, it was good but I won't wait 2 hours for Â deep dish pizza.. the stuffed spinach & cheese bread was pretty good though. But again not something I would wait that long for..
