Little Goat Diner////I shared an order of the corned beef hash which was wonderful.  The hash was sliced so thin, like angel hair pasta, which made it super crispy.  The corned beef has the perfect amount of salt.  So perfectly savory!  We also had a biscuit on the side which was perfect flaky but didn't fall apart.
