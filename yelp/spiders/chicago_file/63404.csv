Smoque BBQ////Looking for some good BBQ in the Chicago area? This is definitely the place. Looking for a nice dining experience? Do yourself a favor and order take out here. First of all, I truly don't understand BYOB in establishments with the type of business Smoque does. The line through the dining area is ridiculous as well. After all the wait you get to sit in an overcrowded dining room. I ordered the baby back ribs with all the meat sides. It was all delicious. Almost made me forget that I had to practically rub elbows with the guy next to me.
