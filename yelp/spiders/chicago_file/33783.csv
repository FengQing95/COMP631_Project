Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Picked this place for a great steak and it didn't disappoint. Good service and great food. The oysters were delicious and the New York Strip sublime. Great atmosphere. Only disappointment was the limited range of wines and in particular American wines, all of which were extremely expensive. As a European this makes no sense. I love American wine, but it shouldn't be more expensive/less accessible in America than French or Italian wine!
