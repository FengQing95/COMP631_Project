Little Goat Diner////My pancakes were gooooorgeous - a big stack of pancakes with apple slices baked right in, with a delicious oatmeal crumble on top. The flavor was delicious, but I couldn't help thinking they were kind of average - something I would have been able to get anywhere. I also got a side of bacon, which was small and greasy. Friends enjoyed their meals, but nobody cleaned their plate.
