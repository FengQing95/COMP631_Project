Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have tried all of the tapas restaurants in town, and I keep coming back to Ba-ba-reeba!  My husband is a vegetarian, and this place has the biggest selection for him, plus, I think the food is less greasy here.  I am addicted to the spanish tortilla, the soups are always great, and the paella is fabulous.  I love the tapas-sized desserts, too.  Nice touch!  Service has always been terrific.  People can bash Lettuce Entertain You restaurants, but the places always deliver the goods, as far as I'm concerned.
