Smoque BBQ////BBQ !!!! Best in Chi-town according to Yelp, and food channel. We arrived at Smoque BBQ around 1 pm on Saturday. It was not packed at all. I ordered Sliced Brisket Platter, it came with slaw and 2 sides, I chose Cornbread and Peach Cobbler (sweet dessert). The brisket was moist and tender, also it had deep and rich smoke flavor. Dunking the brisket into the BBQ sauce or spicy BBQ sauce it made your meal completed. The Coleslaw was fresh and it was without mayo, unlike the usual one. The cornbread was amazed. It was moist, and crumbly. For the dessert, peach cobbler, it was new to me, it was rich and delicious. This place was absolutely better than The Smoke Daddy which next to where i lived. Maybe the portion was bigger, but the quality was bad. At last, the service was very efficient and attentive here.
