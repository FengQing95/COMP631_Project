Art Institute of Chicago////I just couldn't give it five stars.  On it's own, it's a remarkable structure.  And the broad range of visual arts is...stunning.  The museum is very well organized, and the exhibits are placed in such a way that you don't feel like you're randomly walking into rooms, wondering why themes are changing.  And it's a wonderful way to spend the morning or afternoon.  I definitely appreciate it more since they offer free nights on Thursdays.
