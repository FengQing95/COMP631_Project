Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm originally from NY, so I'm on my pizza high horse and long maintained that Chicago style pizza is not pizza.  This pizza has changed my mind.  Comparing NY style pizza to Chicago is like apples and oranges.  The anti-chicago crowd is either accustomed to what they grew up with or are stubborn (remember most of them are yankee fans).  Let's not forget that every state has thousands of pizzerias that say "new york style pizza" and every new yorker correctly says "this isn't true ny pizza".  Well, having finally eaten in Chicago, the same can be said about their style of pizza.
