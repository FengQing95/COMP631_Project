Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////me and my sis had lunch here today before heading to wrigley for the dodgers game.  the walls are lined with sports memoribilia.  pretty cool.  our waitress was also real nice and attentive.  prices are extremely affordable.  a pitcher of miller genuine draft, which was roughly 4 pints, cost 9 bucks.  sah-weeet.  the pizza was pretty tasty too.  nice buttery crust, mozzarella, sausage, and tomato sauce.  not the best chicago pizza, i've had.  that distinction ironically goes to zachary's in oakland, no-cal.  but it's still some damn fine zah....
