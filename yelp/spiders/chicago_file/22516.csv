Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Hotel manager recommended this place to me. I've tried Giordano's and Piazano's, I personally don't like Giordano's at all... It was not crust enough, but I can't tell the difference between Lou Malnati's and Piazano's. They are both very good and definitely worth trying! We went with small Chicago deep dish classic, Italian soup and buffalo wings... And of course, we couldn't finish the wings because the pizza itself was so stuffing.
