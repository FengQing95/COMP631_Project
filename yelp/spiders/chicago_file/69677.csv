Little Goat Diner////I came here on a Saturday at about 130pm knowing there would be a wait but was super surprised when told the wait would be an hour. Because they don't take reservations, it can get pretty crazy in there, but let me tell you - well worth the wait! The experience and the food/drinks make this a great place for family, friends and maybe even a weekend date.
