Little Goat Diner////Anyway, this is my second time here and the food here is so fantastic especially for the price.  You can't beat a ridiculously tender flavorful piece of pork that melts in your mouth and is swimming in their house kimchi that is so jammed packed with flavor it would make you believe that you are ready to die and go to heaven because you just ate one of the the best things that you will ever taste in your life.  This of course is the Fork Pork Chop.  It is so good and it was the perfect serving..just enough to make me full.  My dad really liked his pork belly pancake and my mom loved her BLT with fresh Avocado.  They also have plenty of Vegan options which is great for my SIL.
