Little Goat Diner////There are lots of breakfast options that are served all day ("Cereal Killers"). We wanted the Bull's Eye French Toast, but they were out (sad face), so we had the Crumpets with Chorizo Maple Syrup instead. The crumpets are made to order, topped with crumbles of chorizo, maple syrup, and sliced gooseberries. Perfect combination of sweet and savory.
