Art Institute of Chicago////Rainy days during my time in Chicago afforded me the opportunity to visit the Art Institute. I enjoyed many of the exhibits but was completely mesmerized by the African and Native American exhibits and the "miniature" room. I usually have a short attention span but I was occupied for about 3 hours before my stomach was rumbling for some grub.
