Little Goat Diner////I had been here on a previous occasion, it was a quick lunch & the food was great. I went back yesterday around 1pm(Sunday), we were told the waiting time was 30-45 min. We didn't mind waiting, but it became frustrating when we saw people that got there after us get seated, several groups and pairs. After a while we realized it wasn't just the people that had previous reservations. We asked the hostess how much longer we had to wait and miraculously we got seated right away... This was after we clearly specified we were okay with seating anywhere, minutes later we clearly heard one of the hostess tell a woman there was room in the bar.
