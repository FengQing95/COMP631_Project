Smoque BBQ////Okay. Not a big fan of BBQ but a buddy of mine is. He was raving about this joint and we finally went a couple weeks ago. This place is a bit of a hike from the downtown northside area but worth it. I recommend driving there. Public transportation will take you forever. The place itself is not very big and there was already a line out the door at 6pm but the line does move pretty quick. I do like you order and pay first at the counter then they seat you. It is not fast food style but not a traditional sit down where they come to your table and take your order. I think this turns the tables over faster. I got the half and half which is a half pulled pork and half brisket. The brisket you have a choice of chopped or sliced. I wish I would have gotten the whole sandwich chopped brisket because it was really good. The pulled pork was good too but not as impressive as the brisket. I also go the recommended BBQ baked beans and they were really good. The slaw was good too. Next time I think I will get the platter which is not a sandwich so I can make room for the peach cobbler or corn bread. Reasonably priced too. Will definitely go again. Oh this place is BYOB so in case you want to bring your own beer or wine.
