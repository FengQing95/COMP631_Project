Little Goat Diner////I ate here many months ago and am still talking about how great it was. Amazing burgers and fries. Sometimes gourmet burgers have an emphasis on the toppings over the quality of the actual burger, but that was not the case with Little Goat. The topping combination was perfect and the quality of the burger was exceptional.
