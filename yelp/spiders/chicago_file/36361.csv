Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Although I would've loved to try their desserts, we were way too stuffed to even think about it, and we even brought a good amount of food home!  Reservations are scarce so we just strolled in without one at 6pm on a Friday night and ended up snagging a couple seats at the bar.  They put us on their wait list but by the time we left around 8p we still hadn't been called, so if you want to dine and don't have reservations, finding a seat at one of the bars (one upstairs and one down) or on one of their small sofas is the way to go.  Our first visit was only last week and I'm already thinking about when I can return!
