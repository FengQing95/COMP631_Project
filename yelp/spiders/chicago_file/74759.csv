Little Goat Diner////So my review may be a bit different because I was at a private event at Little Goat. The hor d'oeuvres were absolutely delicious so if you're thinking about hosting a private event here, I would definitely recommend it. But I really want to talk about the EXCELLENT service. Shout out to JP who kept the hor d'oeuvres and drinks coming! Our glasses were never empty. He made sure what type of food restrictions people had too. The girl I was talking to was vegetarian and every time he had a vegetarian friendly hor d'oeuvre, he would make sure the vegetarians would be prioritized so that they got their share of food. I'm impressed with the service and will definitely make a trip to Little Goat again.
