Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My personal no.1 Chicago Steak House and allow me to explain why. The environment...wow....love it. Somewhat of a slick speakeasy old charm to it. Been here more than 3 times and the only negatives I can provide are a douche of a server and the whiskey cocktail I order didn't do much for me. With that said I've had the bone in rib eye medium prepared excellently. Wedge salad with bacon... wow. you would think, " hey how good can a salad be?" but this is salad worth getting everytime. The bacon that accompanies it just blew my taste buds away. Side of garlic mash potatoes was the best I've ever had. Seasoned excellently with just the right texture not too watery or soft. For dessert we had the golden brick sundae with malt whiskey ice cream and it was the best ice cream I ever had. I seem to be repeating myself restating "best I've ever had". That should tell you something. My new favorite steak house over david burke's. In additional visits I've tried the NY Strip, magnificent. My company order the chicken entree she enjoyed very much. If you appreciate a steak of grandeur with a matching layout don't miss this spot.
