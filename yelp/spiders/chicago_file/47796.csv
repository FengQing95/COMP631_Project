Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Have always loved this place but had a frustrating experience trying to pick up a to go order the other day.  I called the restaurant several times and they kept transferring me somewhere else to place the to go order but the phone kept ringing and nobody would pick up.  I hung up and called back twice and try to tell the person who initially answered that nobody was answering at where ever they were transferring me to, but they kept transferring me.  Getting very frustrated, I was went there and ordered in person.  The place was not busy, but the bartender was running around serving people in the entire bar, running food, Cleaning tables, etc and it took forever to get his attention.  When I finally got his attention, I waited 30 min to get two Brussels sprout salads which isn't event a hot dish.  Pretty frustrating experience overall, but we love baba reeba and will probably be back
