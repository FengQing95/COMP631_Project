Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We knew that deep dish pizza takes approximately 30 - 35 minutes to prepare so we counted on a long wait - but his inefficiency made our wait even longer. At one point while I was looking around for him -yes I had to get up to go look for him- he was standing in the kitchen eating cheese! Â We thought about leaving but then we knew we'd not get any pizza anywhere - we didn't have another 30 - 35 minutes to wait at another restaurant. We could either stay and get bad service or leave and get no pizza at all.
