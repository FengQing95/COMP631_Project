Little Goat Diner////At the risk of blowing my cover, this is now my favorite power breakfast place in the city.  Ok, so my office is in the west loop not far from here and I like to make sure there isn't a suit in sight for my power breakfasts.  But every client I've had here has raved, so the proof is in the pudding.
