Smoque BBQ////The Average: The *Corn Muffins and *Baked Beans are average, as well as the greasy *Fries- I love that they use unskinned potatoes for them (think 5Guys). I used to go on weeknights and beat the crowds when I lived in the area, but now that it's a bit of a drive I think it will only be an occasional visit. It is certainly worth at least one visit, because if it is your style of BBQ (esp sauce) then you'll be in love!
