Little Goat Diner////I hate to say this, but my wife and I were psyched to go here for breakfast and the food is not that great. With all the incredible reviews, maybe we set the bar too high, but it was mediocre. I would argue that they try to make the food too unique. I'm all for fusion, and crazy combinations, but the food still has to be good. And it wasn't that good.
