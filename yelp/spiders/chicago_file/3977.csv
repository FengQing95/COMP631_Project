The Purple Pig////Pork ossobuco - This was a massive veal shank. It was so tender that you can literally just pull the bones out clean. The polenta was nice and creamy, but the meat to polenta ratio was way off. I could've used a ton more polenta to pair with each bite of meat. Great dish for big eaters that want a ton of meat.
