Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////OMG this is hands down the best pizza I've ever tasted! I have became a Deep Dish Convert! The flaky buttery crisp crust has changed my concept of what pizza crust should taste like. Our pie came out piping hot with that ooey gooey bubbly mozzarella and delicious rich tomato sauce piled on with our toppings, it's making my mouth water thinking about it!
