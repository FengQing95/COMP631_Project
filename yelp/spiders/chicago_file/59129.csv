Smoque BBQ////I haven't had many peach cobblers so I really cannot be a judge of this dessert but it can be best described as canned peaches with a gooey cinnamon/sugar base with some sort of bread/butter/sugar crumb topping. Â I had one bite and the hubby at the rest but let's just say that he devoured it ^^
