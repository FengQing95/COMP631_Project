Little Goat Diner////So very worth the wait for such a delicious meal. We had the Rueben, BLTA, fries and shared a chocolate malt for desert. Everything had a taste that was unique but oh so very good. We took Amanda's recommendations for what to order and she certainly steered us in the right direction. Thanks for such a fun day! We will be back for sure!
