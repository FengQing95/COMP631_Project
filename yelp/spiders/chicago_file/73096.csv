Little Goat Diner////So I do love the food here but the service has been repeatedly disappointing. Today is the third week in a row when I have been there after the breakfast rush and need to ask for service. Normally I have to grab someone else who is not my server to refill my drink or get the check. There are always multiple people working. I find that they are busy amongst chatting with other workers. Disappointed with how much I love the food. I do not think it compares to the service I receive at any of Izard's other locations.
