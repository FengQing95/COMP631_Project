Smoque BBQ////When we got home we ripped open the food. Everything smelled really good. The brisket was orgasmic! They didn't give you enough it was so so good. I've never had better! The Saint Louis ribs were great too. The meat came off the bones. The baby back ribs were terrible, I couldn't even eat them. They weren't cooked enough so instead of the meat falling off the bone it was more like eating a overcooked breakfast steak and a diner! boo!
