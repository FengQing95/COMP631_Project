Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've lived in the area for four years and have visited the restaurant close to ten times and never have once been disappointed. Usually all of my trips there consists on just my girlfriend and I so I can't comment on what's its like with a group, but looking around and seeing how often there are tables of 8 or more people it has got to be a great time.
