The Purple Pig////-Burrata Cannoli: The cannoli by itself was a bit bland and getting the various garnishes and sauces on it is quite the task but when you do get it all together it creates a tasty bite with a variety of textures & flavors. The burrata is whipped I believe so it was very fluffy and light. The dish only comes with two medium sized cannolis so it's definitely not a filling appetizer and its a bit pricy for the amount you receive. (4/5)
