Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute of Chicago was both an exception and not.  After arriving on Thursday and unwinding a bit at the hotel once the A/C was fixed, I checked out the current and special exhibits on their website.  Thanks to sponsorship by Target, admission was free from 5  to 9 PM on Thursdays and Fridays during the summer.  Normal adult admission is $18.
