The Purple Pig////Wow, what can I say. when you wait a long time for food, you feel as if you have to order everything that was recommended in order to make it worthwhile so that's what we did. there were four of us and we ordered 6 dishes LOL we ordered the pork liver pate, bone marrow, turkey leg, pig ear, pork shoulder and the purple pig platter. we went ALL out and almost finished everything. i'm honestly really impressed at how far we got. the food was incredible. everything that came out tasted SO good. my favorite was probably the pigs ear and the pork shoulder. i probably could have gone without the platter - realized i'm not as big a fan of cured meats as i thought lols i really enjoyed everything though. and the best part was - the food came out SO fast. we ordered and literally like 5 mins later, boom it's out. loved it.
