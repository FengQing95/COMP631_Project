Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As a pizza lover, I couldn't wait to try an authentic Chicago style deep dish pizza in Chicago, and at Lou malnati to boot.  Overall it was ok. Had better pizza in Atlanta. Wish the thickness of the pizza was due to heavy toppings more than just the crust. I've seen and had flat NY style pizza with more toppings on the pizza itself.  Good experience overall
