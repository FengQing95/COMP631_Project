Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had the classic, the veggie and the house salad and let me tell you.....they make a good salad. Maybe it's a structural issue, too much sauce, or maybe as someone chimed in, there's actually too many toppings. There layered on there so densely and with such robotic consistency that each bite is identical to the next. I never really thought about it, but New York pizza is actually this nuanced meal, some bites are more cheesey, some are more saucey, the first bites have that soft thin bread, the middle or fillet is thick and bready, some bites have toppings some don't, it only really becomes apparent how nuanced a traditional slice is when you eat a "pizza" like this. They are going for something here but quantity is a lazy way of creating quality, and its absolutly enjoyable but not overly so. Its rich and savory but far too heavy and without a doubt needs to be paired with a salad to contrast the flavor and density. Oh and I wasn't kidding about the salad, it's real good and doesn't skimp on ingredients at all, but my takeaway from a famous pizza joint shouldn't be how good the salad is.
