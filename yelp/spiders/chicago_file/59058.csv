Smoque BBQ////Beyond amazing!!! TO DIE FOR!! Went here after seeing the place on diners, drive-ins and dives. Cute little place - line is out the door so be prepared to wait!! Food is worth the wait 10 times over though. The St. Louis Ribs are the best thing I've ever tasted in my life. Coleslaw was out of this world. Brisket was not my favorite, but still delicious.
