Little Goat Diner////The service was definitely of the caliber I'd expect from a Stephanie Izard restaurant. They quoted us a 30-45 minute wait but it turned out to be less than 20! They also texted us when our table was ready which was so great, definitely something I'd take advantage of during warmer weather. Additionally, our waitress was helpful in answering our questions and very attentive. I also appreciated them bringing our second carafe of mimosas so quickly there wasn't a dry glass!
