Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////All I can say is wow. I went there with my family and everyone loved everything we ordered. The food was amazing. I don't like steak but everyone else at my table was raving that it was the best steak they have ever had. I had the roasted chicken and it was also amazing. You can't go there and not have the truffle Mac and cheese. It is gooey deliciousness. We also had the salad with crab avocado and it was worth it. And I didn't know Brussels sprouts could taste so good. The sweet potato is also amazing. The service was impeccable. Our server Johnny was very knowledgeable, attentive and above all, so funny. The other staff was also very attentive. Almost too attentive. The table never had an extra plate, knife, or glass on it. I can't wait to go back.
