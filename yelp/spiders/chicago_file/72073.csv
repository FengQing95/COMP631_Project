Little Goat Diner////! The hubby and I split cheesy hash browns and the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes. We each also ordered scrambled eggs with bacon on the side.  I thought it would be too much food but we devoured it all!  The pancakes were my favorite! Light and fluffy with a great chocolate flavor. Hash browns tasted great with their homemade hot sauces, make sure to ask for them.
