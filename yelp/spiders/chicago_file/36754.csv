Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The first two are huge strikes for me as I thought those would be no brainers for such a successful and hyped restaurant.  The chocolate pie, though, was practically inedible... the crust was so hard that I had to wrap my fist around my fork and stab straight down into it to break it apart several times, and the fudge filling was immensely thick and sticky.  It was all around uptight and needed to unwind a bit, you know?
