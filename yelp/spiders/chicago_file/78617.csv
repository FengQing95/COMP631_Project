Little Goat Diner////Little Goat Diner is in a category of its own. The service, ambience and food are going to blow your mind. The ginger medley tea was just what I needed at 8am. Our server made some fantastic recommendations and we opted for the okonomiyaki. Sheesh! We tore this dish up in a matter of minutes! It was the perfect balance of savory & sweet! It was a hearty dish and I recommend splitting it with someone. You're going to need a nap afterwards, the portions are ginormous! Also, make sure you snag an order of the hash browns... the cheese that's hidden underneath..... thank me later.
