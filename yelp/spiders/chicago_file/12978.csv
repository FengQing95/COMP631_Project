Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We died and went to Heaven in a Crusty Deep Dish Pan!  This place was recommended to us first by a gentleman on the plane into Chicago who affectionately called the place "Lou's" and it did NOT let his high regards or our expectations down.  There was a HUGE gaggle of folks waiting as well as a 40-45 minute wait but it was well worth it.  Simply put, GREAT PLACE and even better food.
