Little Goat Diner////We came in here for a quick stop to get lattes. I don't really like hot coffee (all about that iced) but I tried my friend's latte and it was delicious! There is a line though so be prepared to wait like 10-15 min. There's not really any spots to sit down. This is a good place to stop by and get something to drink while you're waiting for the restuarants in the area to call you for your table.
