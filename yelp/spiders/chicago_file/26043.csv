Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I sat at the bar. The bartenders were fantastic. Since I was starving, I ordered a deep dish half and half of the small (serves 2); the Lou (add jalape√±o) and the classic (one with sausage). The bartender warned me it would be one slice too much, but I finished it (without eating the crust on the last two slices). Generous pours on the drinks!
