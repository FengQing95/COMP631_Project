Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////What makes Lou Malnati's Pizza Pies different than the rest is their trademark "buttercrust".  It has a nice flakiness and crisp.  Compared to Gino's East, we felt that the crust tasted better.  But we preferred the quality of the toppings of Gino's East to the sausage and sauce here.  The sauce wasn't as flavorful and robust as the sauce we had at Gino's East.
