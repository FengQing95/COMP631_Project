Smoque BBQ////Recently I was stuck at the children's intensive care unit for 5 days of misery. One day a ray of sunshine came through the door- the March of Dimes organized a Father's Day lunch for the families stuck there. Smoque was generous and kind enough to donate some excellent brisket. Thanks for making my stay a bit better!
