Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visiting from MN!  We were recommended to go here by many people.  It was a short walk from our hotel.  We ordered a small "The Malnati Chicago Classic".  It was plenty for my wife and I. The crust was definitely the best part of the pizza.  I've definitely had better pizza before, but overall it was a good pizza and we had great time.  It was very reasonably priced.
