Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba just catered my wedding over the weekend and I can't even begin to tell you how wonderful Alison Lowry and the staff that night were before, during, and after the event. Throughout the entire process, Alison was wonderful and extremely easy to work with. We met about the event once and everything after that was done via e-mail. Very convenient and she was very prompt with her responses. According to my other event organizers (since I was clearly busy ;)), the Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba staff was prompt, very well prepared, and just overall wonderful to work with. Unfortunately, we did not get to eat, but I assure you we will be going there soon on a date. According to our guests, the food was just AMAZING! Everyone has been ranting and raving about it for the last few days.
