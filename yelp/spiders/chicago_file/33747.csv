Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Steaks are at the core of the menu but there are other options like hand-cut spaghetti and southern fried chicken. For our appetizers we ordered the roasted bone marrow and the baked goat cheese. Both were excellent. The baked goat cheese paired perfectly with the wine. I had the steak frites and a side of grilled tomatoes for my entree. While I have no complaints about my dinner, I regret not trying some of the more involved dishes that kept getting delivered to the tables around me.
