Smoque BBQ////If you dig vinegar-based BBQ sauce (which I do), then this is the place for you.  Brisket sandwich (widely and positively reviewed) deserves the recognition.  To me, though, you shouldn't skip the ribs, especially the spare ribs.  They have two sauces, and one is technically tomato-based, but even that has a pretty strong hit of vinegar.  I love both sauces.  My only wish is a spicy sauce option, which they don't have.  As an added bonus, they have the best sides of any BBQ joint we've been to.  The coleslaw has no mayo, the mac and cheese is delicious and plenty crusty on top, and the fries are fresh-cut and seasoned well.  Everything is super well executed.  We will be back for sure!
