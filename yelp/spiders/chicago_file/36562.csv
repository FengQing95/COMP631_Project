Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Finally at the end of the night, our waiter brought us ice cream to celebrate my friends birthday. This ice cream was UH-MAZING. It's pretty hard to impress me with ice cream just because a.) ice cream is not usually my dessert of choice and b.) I've had a LOT of good ice cream. But this one was very creamy and smooth, and they chilled the tin ice cream dish it came in, which kept the texture and temperature perfect. I highly recommend ordering ice cream as a dessert! You definitely won't regret it.
