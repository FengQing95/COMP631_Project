Smoque BBQ////I had to see what all the hype was about and to be honest.. it's just another bbq place. So what happens is... you get there.. wait in line.. order and pay for your food.. and if you want to sit... see the employee in line and he'll seat you as soon as a seat becomes available. I had the bbq brisk and it was good... standard.. it did indeed taste smokey! I also had the cornbread and bbq baked beans... ehh.. I could have done without the cornbread. Their coleslaw is actually quite tasty!! And their infamous peach cobbler was really nothing I would write home about. Overall... good if you're hankering for some meat.. but be sure to stop by during the weekday when it's not too crowded!
