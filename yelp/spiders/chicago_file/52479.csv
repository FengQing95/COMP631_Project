Smoque BBQ////How does it compare to Slows?  In my non-expert opinion, I'd say they're just different animals.  Slows has a more expansive menu, but what Smoque does, it does well.  I liked having more sauce options at Slows, but I also liked the simplicity of the Smoque experience.  I felt like the meat was more flavorful at Slows, but I liked being able to get a half portion AND sides for a lower price at Smoque.  BBQ is something many people take seriously, and I am not one of them, but I am grateful that Slows is nearby, and that I can visit Smoque whenever I'm in Chicago.
