Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visited Chicago for a few days Lou's was recommended by others and the reviews were good however I think it is highly over rated. We waited 30 for a seat on a Thursday night which wasn't bad at all for 2 people however the wait for the small pizza to arrive took over an hour. The crust is like pie crust, flaky not much flavor, the sauce is sweet, the cheese was the best part, we ordered pepperoni also but there was none on there. I would try another place before coming here again.
