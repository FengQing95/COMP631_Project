Smoque BBQ////I liked Smoque. I went with a large group and was able to sample a variety of foods. Â The Brisket was great. I will order that again when I return. I also loved the chicken. Personally I wasn't too fond of the ribs. They were tough. I like my ribs to fall off the bone. I didn't know you could bring your own booze. That would have made the dinner even better. All said and done I will be back.
