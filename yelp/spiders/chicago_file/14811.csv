Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The salad was good but I remember I had spinach salad and it was much better. Spinach bread is great and there are lots of cheese inside and the crust is tasty. However, I feel Lou pizza is not that good as the one I had when I first time here. But I can't remember what kind of pizza I had when I came here the first time.
