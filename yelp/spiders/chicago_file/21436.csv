Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I guess if you come to Chicago deep dish pizza would be something on your list to try. I am a big fan of pizza in general. Being an East Coaster, I have to say that deep dish pizza is not for me. Not really a great beer selection here- pizza and beer go hand in hand.Pizza choices are ok. What I did like was it wasn't too much bread compared to some other deep dish pizza options. This is just a basic pub place.
