Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The main room was dark and crowded, but that was validation that you're in a good spot. A few old fashioneds to choose from. Steak and fish were perfectly cooked. There was no deliberation of whether I wanted the obscure vegetable topped with a quail egg and topped further with the flame-scorched fruit or the other dish that required an appendix. Nope. Filet mignon please and more bread.
