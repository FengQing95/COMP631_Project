Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Finally my first tapas experience! I'm so glad it was at Ba Ba Reeba. I met a fellow yelp friend here on a Wednesday night for dinner and sangria. This place is huge and it filled up quickly. There were many large tables and you could tell this was a very popular place for large group parties but my girlfriend and I felt just as comfortable on our own. We ordered sangria, a few small plates, paella, and dessert small plates. My favorites of the meal were the spicy potatoes and the short rib. The short rib was perfectly tender and the sauce on those potatoes was the bomb. Since we both checked in on yelp we received two complimentary dessert tapas and our waitress gave us a third complementary one since she wanted us to try all her favorites. So nice!
