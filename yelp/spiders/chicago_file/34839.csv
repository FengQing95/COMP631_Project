Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place is super romantic and has a great atmosphere. The drinks are incredible, and you can tell they put a lot of care into them. Even the free bread they bring out was the best sourdough bread that I've ever had. The steaks are very good and flavorful, and the desserts are heavenly. The lemon meringue pie was the most flavorful amazing dish. Definitely a must try. It is a great place for a date!
