Smoque BBQ////What I will hold against them is their utter inability to BBQ some meat! I had St. Louis and Baby Back ribs; both bland meat. Rub nothing special (too much of something...clove?) on taste but created a nice (carmelized?) crust. Wife had the chicken; exact same opinion.  Mac & cheese could not have set better in the mouth; if only it had tasted as good as it felt.  Slaw vinegar-y, sauce vinegar-y, cornbread an utter diappointment (and I do consider myself a bit of a cornbread expert).  Baked beans...yep, you guessed it...vinegar-y. Onions cooked to a beautiful texture and translucence, but apparently added to the beans because they certainly did nothing to help the flavor; beans were not tender enough. Sauce and everything was beautiful to look at; and I am sure a quite-qualified individual established the recipes/operations. But this is a case of a restauranteur trying to BBQ and not of a BBQ man trying to run a restaurant. I classed it as "white men can't BBQ," no SOUL in this comfort food.
