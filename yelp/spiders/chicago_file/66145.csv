Smoque BBQ////My initial reaction on opening my box of food was: these were the smallest racks of ribs I have ever seen. Maybe typical for this area but feels like a terrible value for $30. I believe they gave two short ends of the rack, but they were not very meaty. The meat did came off the bone cleanly with a little bit of effort though. Only had one really fatty chunk. The ribs came with two Memphis sauce, no Carolina. I tried both and nothing special about either sauce so I just stuck with what was served. Mac was alright. Cornbread was flavorless. Coleslaw is made without mayo. I wasn't sure at first but it grew on me. Very refreshing.
