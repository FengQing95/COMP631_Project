Art Institute of Chicago////I must add however that back in the day, when it was just an Art "Institute", it was much more affordable.  Now that it is an Art "Palace" the plebes must pay the rent.  Everyone knows that the rent always goes up.  Now days it is quite high. There are also additional cost for Audio Phone guides and special exhibits.  Garage parking in downtown Chicago is an added expense.  It can be an expensive day, so get there early and make the most of it.
