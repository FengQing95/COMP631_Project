Smoque BBQ////My friend Bethany, who lives nearby, recommended this place and it did not disappoint. This place is Mmmm Mmmmm good! My favorite? The pork sandwich. Ask for the Memphis sauce. This is the more "BBQ-y" of the two sauces. The other is more of a vinegar base and lacks that tangy BBQ flavor. Â The mac n' cheese and peach cobbler make for delicious sides. My friend, Bethany, loves the ribs. I have yet to try them as they are a bit messy to eat. I guess I can be a BBQ prima donna that way! lol Smoque is closed on Mondays, but other than that, it's a fantastic place worth checking out, with outdoor seating, weather permitting!
