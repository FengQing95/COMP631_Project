Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Best way to describe it is: YOU MUST GO! Everything was perfect from the beginning until the end. The restaurant is well located, with and atmosphere I have never seen: super cool decoration and illumination. All the waiters and waitress were super attentive, and explained us everything in detail. Their suggestions were helpful, and lead us to choose a couple of dishes we really enjoyed. The food was excellent! We had the shrimps as appetizer, and I had the pork ad entree. Great choice! The price, a bit expensive, but definitely it is worth. It was in part because the wine was quite expensive, but as I noticed in my trip to Chicago, wines are really pricey in every single (fine) restaurant.
