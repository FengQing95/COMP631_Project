Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's is king!!! It is my goal to eat at all the well known deep dish places in Chicago. I think I still have Gino's East and Uno's left to try, but I have to say my favorite deep dish is from Lou's. The ratio of sauce, cheese, meat, and carb is undeniably the best. Also that butter crust is so good- I could eat it for dayyzzz. My friends and I ordered a half chicago classic and half pepperoni. Butter crust vs no butter crust was the difference between night and day. I will never make the mistake of not ordering butter crust again. Anyways there's always a long wait here and the interior is kinda dingy and crowded since it is always so busy. However, it's the best deep dish I have had thus far and deserves five stars.
