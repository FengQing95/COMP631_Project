Little Goat Diner////For a "diner" this place has a light and airy feel.  We went on a Tuesday night with our three-year-old and were pleasantly surprised by the service and quality of the food.  I ordered the buttered dinner rolls to start because my daughter was hungry.  I would go back just for the rolls.  They were like if a croissant and a French roll had a baby--so good.  The fried chicken was good, but there just was not enough of it.  My husband got the ribs, which were interesting, but not what he was hoping for.  The mashed potatoes were sort of gooey and the omelet my daughter had was a little runny.  All in all everything was good, but not great.  The rolls were the only true standout.  However, we will definitely go back and try some different things because it was kid-friendly and it's hard to find a decent restaurant that is kid and parent-friendly.
