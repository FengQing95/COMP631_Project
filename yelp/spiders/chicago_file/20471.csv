Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Of course, as out of towners, we came here because we heard that Lou had the authentic chicago deep dish pizza. Â For starters, we had the spinach stuffed bread. It was served quickly and warm with a little side of marinara. It was a perfect appetizer as we waited for pizza. There was a slightly long wait for the pizza but I'm sure it was due to the fact of the restaurant was at maximum capacity.
