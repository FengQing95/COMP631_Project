Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This fall we were walking past Bavette's and we decided to see if we could get a table.  It was 5:30 on a week night.  They were able to accommodate us with a table in the basement.  It was so dark down there we could barely see each other.  The appetizers were unremarkable.  I ordered the pork chop (~$30+, ala carte).  It was so overcooked, I could barely cut it.  I couldn't see how overcooked it was because it was so dark!  It was over $300 for the three of us.  It was not worth it.
