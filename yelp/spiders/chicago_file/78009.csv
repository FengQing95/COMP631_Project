Little Goat Diner////So, wow. Came 2 weeks (two Saturdays) in a row just because I couldn't believe myself and wanted to confirm before I made this statement: I think this is the best breakfast in Chicago. I JUST moved from LA and no I haven't even begun to start eating and exploring the culture and foods of Chicago but this place is just excellent when it comes to breakfast.
