Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our waiter was very nice, but seemed a bit overwhelmed; he stopped by to suggest the specials and ran away just as I opened my mouth to ask for a half pitcher of Sangria.  A few minutes later, my friend and I had already decided which tapas we wanted; the waiter returned and we made our full order.
