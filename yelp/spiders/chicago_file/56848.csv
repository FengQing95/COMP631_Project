Smoque BBQ////* CORN BREAD preference is like having a bias for a Ford F-15 or a Chevy Silverado. Regardless, you should wear a bag on your head if you don't eat cornbread with your barbecue. That sounds mean, but it's true. I like CB slightly sweet and crumbly without pieces of corn which is just plain nasty.
