Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Hot Tapas: This isn't really a tapa but we had this wonderfully tasty soup that was carrot and orange I think..but don't worry it doesn't really taste super orangey, it had almost an Indian flavor to it. SO good! We also had fried green peppers and course salt. It was very good but know that it is spicy! And speaking of spicy, I also had the spicy potatoes with tomato alioli sauce. Ohhhh my oh my! This was my favorite savory dish! Â It was sort of spicy but not so spicy that I stopped popping those spuds in my mouth. And the great part was that it was literally a mountain of potatoes and it was plenty to share and still have tons left for me!
