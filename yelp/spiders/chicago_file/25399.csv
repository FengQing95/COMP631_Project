Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered personal pizzas so we could try two varieties - The Classic, and The Lou.  To be honest, I've only known NY pizza, and I was not sure what we'd be getting into.  I was expecting something very heavy and stuffed with cheese.  I also normally don't like red pizzas (I love a good white, veggie) because I find them overwhelmingly tomato-y, but these were lovely - very light, you could taste the fresh tomato (but it wasn't too much), and the portions were just right.  For the Classic - I'm not usually a fan of sausage either since usually it's an overpowering flavor, but this was very subtle and worked nicely.
