Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My favorite dish is the buttermilk fried chicken, I always introduce new people to the dish because it never disappoints. It is nicely crispy and just saucy enough with a side sauce that makes you want to eat every dish with it. The dish is also highly recommended by the restaurant and reasonably priced.
