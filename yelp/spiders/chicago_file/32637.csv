Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our waiter was great and the room is awesome, very warm and welcoming with truly a speakeasy feel.  My last trip to Chicago last year introduced me to Maudes Liquor Bar which I loved.  After visiting both Au Cheval and Bavettes, I can't wait to see what's next for Mr. Sodikoff.  Whatever it is, I'm IN!!!
