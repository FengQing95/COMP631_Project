Smoque BBQ////For my late lunch and early dinner, I got the sliced brisket sandwich with mac n cheese and coleslaw. I also had a craving for ribs, so I got the St. Louis half rack. Thinking these portions wouldn't fill me up, I was only able to finish the sandwich and mac. With your sandwich, you get to sample both of their sauces, a Carolina sauce, and the Memphis. For both the sandwich and ribs, I used the Memphis. I found that the vinegar-based Carolina concoction was a little too overpowering for both meats. Â
