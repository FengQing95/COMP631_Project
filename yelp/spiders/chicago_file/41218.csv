Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love Cafe Ba Ba Reeba! The desserts are so cute! The chicken and artichoke paella is my favorite! The sangria is amazing! I love the white peach.  I keep coming back intending to try new things, but always stick to what I know I love, including the patatas bravas and the stuffed mushrooms! The food is amazing! The wait staff could be a little nicer.  It is convenient that checks can be split for each person.
