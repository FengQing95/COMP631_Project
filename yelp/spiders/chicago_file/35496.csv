Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Now, I could go on and on about my experience at Bavette's. The only thing you need to know is that the waiter was fantastic (Brandon, I think was his name), the food was fantastic (I ordered the petite 6 oz. filet- BEST STEAK I'VE EVER HAD), the atmosphere was fantastic, and we literally can't wait to go back. Unfortunately, everyone else feels the same way. So get on OpenTable ASAP and start planning for... May? You won't regret it.
