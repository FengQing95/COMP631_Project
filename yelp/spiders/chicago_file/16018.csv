Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Anyways, for around 12pm on a Friday afternoon we only had to wait 15 minutes or so, there were perhaps 5 or 6 other groups already waiting and no one seemed to be too frazzled to be standing around. The great staff also brought out 3 medium pizzas cut in to sample bite sizes for those of us waiting for our tables. While waiting we were able to give in our orders as well to cut down on time. Which is a great default service they offer as we still had to wait at least 10 minutes for our food arrived after being seated. Â
