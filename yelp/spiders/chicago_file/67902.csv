Little Goat Diner////Awesome food and service. Had the blue plate special- cubano sandwich with ham, cheese, pork belly, pickled onions, grilled to perfection topped with two eggs and served on top of mushroom mole.  Pure heaven dreamed up by a line cook I'm sure.  If you get a chance to go, it's a must.  We need Little Goat in Phoenix.
