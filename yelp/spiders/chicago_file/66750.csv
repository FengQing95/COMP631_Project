Little Goat Diner////Went to the Little Goat for breakfast on a Sunday and it was delicious. The weather was nice so we decided to sit outside.  I suggest making a reservation because the restaurant was definitely busy. I ordered the smoked corned beef hash and had trouble picking which homemade sauce I wanted to use on each bite.  The portions were huge and if we had a place to put the leftovers we definitely would have taken them. I think this place is a great stop for breakfast and is worth the price for breakfast!
