Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We had a few people recommend Lou Malnati's to us prior to our trip so decided to check it out. We got the bruschetta and the Malnati Deep Dish, which were both good but nothing outstanding. The service was pretty slow and the waitress also never brought my soup (they took it off the check after I mentioned it to them). Overall I really thought this place was just "ok".
