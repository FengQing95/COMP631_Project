Art Institute of Chicago////I got to stand and take the time to really study my painting, and I couldn't believe just how large it was. There was incredible detail that could not be saved by a reduction to thirty-six inches wide and I marveled at just how incredible the painting was. I can imagine some people have the same feeling when they see the Mona Lisa, or a Picasso.
