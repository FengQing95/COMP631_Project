Smoque BBQ////While long, the line moved frequently, at least a little. When we finally ordered, a guy found us a table and we sat and waited for our number to be called. Seating is heavily communal; if you aren't comfortable with coming close to bumping elbows with another fan of great BBQ, go elsewhere. My companion and I were sat next to 2 Harley bikers and 2 old ladies, both pairs of whom had been coming to Smoque for years.
