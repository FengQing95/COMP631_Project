Little Goat Diner////Note of warning.  They use a system that texts you when they are ready to seat you and don't go looking for you unlike Girl & the Goat.  The place can get exceedingly loud and busy, so double check that they have your number down correctly.  Get them to repeat the number to you if they don't offer to do so as a courtesy.  Our hour wait turned into nearly a few hours before we realized what was going on.  Time flies when you're with good company and the bar is working their magic. :)
