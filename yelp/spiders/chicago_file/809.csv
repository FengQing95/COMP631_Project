Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Oh what a fantastic place! You can't go wrong with Wildberry Cafe. They have a wide selection of classic american breakfast at a fair price. My favorite thing is that you can get the "upgraded" pancakes as a side instead of toast for an extra few bucks. I liked the corn beef hash with the berry bliss pancakes!
