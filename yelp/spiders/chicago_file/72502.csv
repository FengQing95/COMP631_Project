Little Goat Diner////Went here before a Hawks game for lunch. The food was all very good! I loved that the restaurant had a diner feel but with food that was better than diner food. I ordered a cheeseburger, fries and a chocolate shake. It did not disappoint. The only downside was my boyfriend left feeling sick and had pretty bad food poisoning. However, he would go back and so would I, that speaks for how good the food was!
