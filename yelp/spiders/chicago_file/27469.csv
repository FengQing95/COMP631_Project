Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The service here is phenomenal. It was so hectic throughout the whole place but the hosts were very nice and accommodating. Our server was exceptional because he never forgot to check in on us and even though he was running around like a chicken, he would find time to chat with us and give us pointers about where to go, what to see, where to eat, etc.
