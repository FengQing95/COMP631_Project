Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When the pizza arrived and we took our first bite, I could immediately tell that the "butter crust" was worth every calorie. It gave the crust a nice sheen, a buttery aroma, and a light and crispy crunch when my teeth dug right in. Inside, the smooth and velvety cheese just melted and ooozed through, giving the pepperoni and mushrooms just that extra burst in flavor. I was happy that there were no signs of uncooked or squishy "dough," so common in many flawed deep dish pizzas.
