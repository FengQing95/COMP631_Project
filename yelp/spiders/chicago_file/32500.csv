Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza was honestly quite good fresh and as leftovers. The deep dish was quite crispy and the ingredients tasted like they were individually and carefully selected. I honestly kept thinking about the pizza for several days after. The price ($26 for a small pizza meant for two people that is the size of a standard personal pizza), however, makes it not worth it to venture a trip here.
