Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our fave location. It looks nice and inviting and has a big barn door-like front to it. Best flavor went to "The Lou" with extra garlic and the most important crispy, buttery, tasty butter crust!!! It was great that there was a low carb option too, where they replace crust with sausage. They accommodated 20 of us at a very long table. Their house salad with the lemon poppyseed dressing makes a perfect side dish order. It must be their butter crust superior know-how that makes Lou Malnati sound so much like Illuminati??
