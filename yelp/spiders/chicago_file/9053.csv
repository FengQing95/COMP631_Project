Art Institute of Chicago////First thing's first .... I'm not really someone that knows how to appreciate art very well. Even so, going into this museum I could understand why it was spoken so highly of. Large variety, different genres, and also a lot of depth in each one. There are sculptures, paintings, photography, and crafts. There was a very small section of architecture design (what I wanted to see), which was a bit disappointing, but generally speaking one could not ask for more art in a single place. The building was also beautiful. One (big) thing that I did not like was some of the employees here were quite pretentious. The bag check people for example were a bit unfriendly and spoke to us like we were lower than them. Similarly for the employee at the ticket counter. They were one of the first people we saw and my wife and I did not feel welcome into this museum. That being said, this was not true for all employees. But, first impressions do matter.
