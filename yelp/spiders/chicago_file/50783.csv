Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The heirloom tomato salad came out next and did not disappoint. There were portions/wedges of several colored tomatoes set upon some green goddess dressing that was great. There was thinly sliced cucumber that I thought to be a bit over salted, but it did balance well with the other parts that didn't have the same treatment and worked well in the same bite. Small toasted pieces of ricotta cheese also found on the plate made it even more awesome.
