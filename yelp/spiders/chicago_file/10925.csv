Art Institute of Chicago////It's been awhile since I've been to the Art Institute. You forget how amazing it is. You can spend an entire weekend and still not see everything. We went for the Van Gogh Bedroom Exhibition and stayed for the Andy Warhol and Picasso. Wow is all I have to say. I love how they recreated the bedroom and the floor plan highlighting the additional spaces in the house was real cool. Identifying Gauguin's bedroom right next door was a nice twist and surprise. This is an absolute must see. First of its kind in the USA.
