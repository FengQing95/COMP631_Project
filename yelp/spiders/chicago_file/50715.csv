Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This was an AMAZING dining experience. Recently moving to Chicago, this is definitely my new go-to tapas and drinks spot. Absolutely love the atmosphere, very upbeat and the service is friendly and attentive. Was here with friends, we tried tons of apps, not one we didn't love. Also had a house margarita and couple pitchers of different sangrias. Thank you for an amazing night!
