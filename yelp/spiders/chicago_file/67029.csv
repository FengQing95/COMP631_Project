Little Goat Diner////There are many, many wonderful things about this restaurant.  The food was fantastic.  I had the pork belly pancake, loved it!  The bacon and toffee milkshake is amazing.  There's so many interesting combinations and fun choices on the menu, the kind of place where you want to keep coming back so you can try everything.  Even the kids menu pancakes were delicious, my son scarfed them up.  The beer list is respectable, but I think a little bit snobby with the glassware and smaller sizes for the same price as a pint.
