Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////On to the food....the coffee here is great.  It is Intelligensia (sp?) and it has great body and a nice smooth finish.  The pancakes are out of this world.  My wife had the Oreo Cookie stuffed pancakes and I had the special Pumpkin Cinnamon spice pancakes.  Both were outstanding and my wife said it was the best she ever had.  I also had the spanish omelet, and although I would have liked it more spicy, it was really flavorful and filling.
