Art Institute of Chicago////Great museum. Large collections to get lost in.  The people are out of this world terrible.  I found it very strange that everyone was taking photos of the work. I thought it was universally understood that was a no-no.  I even saw girls putting their arms around sculptures and taking selfies.  I'm 30 going on 60 apparently but I was pretty appauled. My suggestion is to go early morning or during the week.  Renzo did a superb job on the addition. It has to be one of the best spaces in the world.
