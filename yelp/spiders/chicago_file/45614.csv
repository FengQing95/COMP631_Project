Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My favorite tapas restaurant. I have been here mor times than I can count. The food is amazing and the plate prices are so reasonable you can continue ordering until the entire menus has been experienced. The dessert menu is well worth exploring and I strongly implore you to try the entire thing. Good luck and finish the food!
