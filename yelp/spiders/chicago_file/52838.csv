Smoque BBQ////I recommend going early. There usually is a line out the door and the meat can run out. I think we ordered around 645 and there was plenty, still a line out the door. It goes fast and seating is cozy but somehow always works out by the time you get to the front. My favorite bbq is in st Louis but for Chicago the staff and food do it for me here.
