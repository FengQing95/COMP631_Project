Little Goat Diner////I've been to both the diner and cafe (Little Goat Bread) and I really like the spicy mayo shrimp with avocado & cheese cheese sandwich at the cafe. The diner food is good also but consists of heavier food choices. I did enjoy the los drowned sandwich, macho nachos, and smoked pork & toffee crunch shake at the diner.
