Little Goat Diner////After much buzz about all the GOATS  :)  We decided to go out with a group of friends to try it out.  I must say from start to finish it was an experience.  We all tried at least 1 of the signature cocktails and they were great.  After sitting at the bar we sat down and we loved the hipster modern feel of this new age dinner.  As we were ordering and talking the decor consistently came up in conversation.  We'd discover new things from wallpaper, to the bathroom style and the wood on the wall.   We all ordered different entrees and I must say our server was great.  She gave great recommendations and the foods delivery out was quick and was still fresh.  All entrees were plated with care and of course everything was delicious.  For desert we shared the blueberry pie...yum yum my favorite and also the chocolate taco-double yum.  This place is definitely worth a try!  It is like not other diner I've ever been in and somehow on the way out you think this is unique and interesting and this chef got it right from top to bottom.  Highly recommended!
