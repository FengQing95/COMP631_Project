Little Goat Diner////Great place to eat If you want a comfy, relax, and extremely tasty diner style experience. The service was great and the food was really tasty. I had the vanilla milkshake hmmmm so good even the whipped cream was tasty. Then I had the goat almighty one pound of amazingness. My girlfriend had the fat club which was crunchy and super tasty and not to mention huge. Even the chicken tenders were moist and cocked to perfection. We also tried the macho nachos and omg the home made chips with the meat and melted cheese was to die for. I can keep going but it's not worth it, you need to check this place out for yourself it won't disappoint!!!
