Little Goat Diner////YUM YUM YUM! Food was delish! I'd recommend going on a weekday night. We had no problem getting seated at 6 pm on a Wednesday. For starters, the nachos were amazing! I actually was trying to convince my friends to skip it because I thought it was silly to get nachos but they were delicious! There is something special about those chips. They are HUGE though. Us four girls shared it and I was honestly feeling full after. We then ordered three dishes to share and we could have done two. We got the bulls eye  french toast which the  french toast was DELICIOUS! but the chicken didn't go well with it. I am a huge fan of sweet and savory but it just didn't work for us. Then we got the lordes sammich which was tasty but wasn't in love with. Then lastly, the goat burger which is so crazy huge, we were so intimidated. We picked at the meat which was delicious, but it's impossible to eat as a burger. It's like 6 inches tall! Insane. Anyway, the service was great. We sat at the bar waiting for our friends and I got the first drink on the cocktail menu that tasted like cucumber and had vodka in it.. that was good. The decor is cute.. like a classy diner. I'd come back to try other dishes for sure. Excited to finally get reservations for Girl & the Goat for next month!!
