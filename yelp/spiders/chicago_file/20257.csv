Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have been looking forward to earing good deep dish pizza since I ate at Giordano in Orlando. I was a bit scared that I just wasn't I fan of deep dish. Thank goodness I came here. When we say down we ordered the calamari and the pizza right away since it takes them around 30 min to bring the pizza out. The calamari was amazing the brought it out accompanied with a sweet and tangy sauce that was to die for. It was finger licking good. When the pizza came I couldn't wait to dig in. It was the most delicious pizza I ever had. It wasn't too loaded but it had everything it needed. It was honesyly the best pizza I've ever had. I very much looking forward to eating here again.
