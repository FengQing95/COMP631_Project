Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The place was packed with 2 hour wait.  I"m used to great NY pizza and think the pizza was ok.  I was expecting it to knock me off my feet but I didn't leave Chicago thinking I had the best pizza.  IF I Lou's or Giordanos, I would select Giordanos anytime and I'm not one to like "chain" pizza.  I rather find the hole in the wall pizza place that makes your mouth water and didn't feel like this was it.  Loved the decor and location.
