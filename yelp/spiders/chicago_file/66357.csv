Little Goat Diner////Dropped by Little Goat on my way to the airport. I had just enjoyed a delicious meal at Girl & the Goat a few nights before and I heard about how Little Goat opened recently by the same chef. I tried the beef and the shrimp sandwich. The beef was good but I thought it was nothing too special...but then again I didn't eat it right away. However, the shrimp sandwich was amazing! I'm still thinking about it after I finished eating it. I definitely want to go back next time if I'm ever back in Chitown!
