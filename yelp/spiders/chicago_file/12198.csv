Art Institute of Chicago////Love coming here, don't come often but if it's an art exhibit worth seeing and or I Â come on their free nights it's always a treat to explore and look around the the various exhibits to see paintings, sculptures, and or photographs! One of my favorite art galleries! Previously went to the Warhol exhibit and loved it!!
