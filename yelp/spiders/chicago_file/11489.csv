Art Institute of Chicago////This is the 2nd largest art museum in the US with approximately a million sq feet of space. It is very photography friendly although there are a few minor restrictions on certain exhibits. With the size and variety of the museum, it's great for bringing groups for educational and work related outings, but also great to enjoy by yourself. On a rainy day, there is really no better place to enrich your art experiences but this is also a great place to visit on a sunny day as well.
