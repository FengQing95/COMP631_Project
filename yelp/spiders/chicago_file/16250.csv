Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time in Chicago, heard about their reputation, tried out their veggie deep dish, they had a solid 1.5 hour wait on Friday night, and took another 20-30 mins to get the pizza  -- and it was delicious! Juice, cheesy, flavorful deep dish. The cheese and sauce both tasted very good. I ordered small but it was more than enough for 2-3 meals because their pizza is dense and heavy -- great value for money in my opinion.  Will definitely go back next time I'm in Chicago!
