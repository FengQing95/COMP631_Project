Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Was lucky enough to sneak a last minute reservation. Thankful it was an early reservation as it took hours to digest all the food. The restaurant is cozy, dark and on pretentious considering it's one of the top rated restaurants in all Chicago. Ordered the 42 day aged bone in ribeye with a side of truffle Mac and cheese. Started with bread which is fantastic. The steak was cooked exactly to order. Very tasty with no sauce or additional flavoring necessary. The truffle Mac was rich with just a little char on the top layer of cheese. Very rich. It was too much food for me to eat but as a carnivore it's not in me to leave meat left. I almost ate myself sick. Skipped dessert and walked as much as I could. Next time I'm in Chicago I'll take the wife here but we will split the steak and get some more starters. Must try! Steak is reasonable priced for the quality. Expect $55-$70 for a steak. Sides are about $12 and good for 2-3 people.
