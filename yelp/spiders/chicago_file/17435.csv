Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'd give it 6 stars. Good service, decor and pricing. Deep dish sausage, Lou's deep dish, Â Lou's salad and calamari = delicious. Tip: if you carry out- getting the deep dish pizza cut will make the bottom crust wet, but dont' worry, it will dry if you leave it out. And it's still really good.
