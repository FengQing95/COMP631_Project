Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We had our first sub par dining experience at Bavettes yesterday evening for my birthday dinner. Something was obviously going wrong in the kitchen. What could have turned in to a completely tainted experience leaving my husband and I considering not returning was handled with the utmost class by the manager Matt and our server. They were apologetic for our disappointed and rectified the situation in more ways than we could have imagined. While the back of the house had an off night, the front of the house was able to overcompensate and we will be back. #pureclass
