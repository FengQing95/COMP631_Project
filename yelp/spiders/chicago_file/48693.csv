Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Yummy yummy tapas. The make your own Bloody Mary bar is awesome, albeit overwhelming with options (not a bad thing!). I love taking friends from out of town here for brunch. It's a bit on the pricy side but totally worth it, great interior ambience as well. And friendly wait staff. Would recommend.
