Smoque BBQ////I am on the fence about this place....on one side I love their bbq sauce! Better than anything I've had so far......But on the other I was disappointed by the mac n cheese and by their menu. Its a very simple menu...Ribs, Chicken, Brisket, and some sides/salads. Â The cole slaw was fantastic, didn't seem to have any mayo at all. The cornbread was great, but I wasn't fond of their baked beans. Overall it was an OK experience. Prices are good. Location is not so good.
