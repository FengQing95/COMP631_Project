Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For entrees, I had their petite filet well done and it was great. It comes with salt on the side and I was impressed their meat already comes with bernaise sauce while other places do it a la carte. My mom got the Dover sole special, which she said was amazing. However, she orders it a lot and has never paid the high price Bavette's was charging for it that night. Our friends ordered the filet and the ribeye and seemed to enjoy both.
