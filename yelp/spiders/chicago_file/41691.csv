Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Serviceable, but I don't see why I keep going back.  One can definitely tell that this is where DePaul guys bring their dates if they're trying to be "romantic".  Nothing romantic about the place, crowded, loud, dishes seem pedestrian and thrown together.  It's a good place to eat, but recommending it would be a shortcut to thinking.
