Little Goat Diner////A charming diner with fantastic food. I got the pork belly pancakes, which came with some sort of bok choy slaw salad, all of which was on top of a scallion pancake (which, for those of you who've had them before, is decently authentic--could've used a little more scallion, but not bad in general). The pork belly was extremely tender and perfectly seasoned, and overall I loved the Asian twist on an American brunch.
