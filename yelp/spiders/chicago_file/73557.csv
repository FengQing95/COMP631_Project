Little Goat Diner////Fast forward a year, we were out last night celebrating a cousins birthday and he chose Little Goat for dinner. I had the veggie quesadilla and my fianc√© chose 2 different meals, both of which were already out (a total or five or six items were already out), and he ended up with the short ribs. Well my quesadilla was just ok. I've had better. He enjoyed his short ribs, but today he is vomiting and on the toilet. This guys never ever gets sick. He felt sick shortly after the meal so I know it's from the food. We planned a 3 day wknd to enjoy our time off, and he is now sick and in bed.
