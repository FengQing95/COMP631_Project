Little Goat Diner////I want to come back and try their milkshakes, dinner menu, and bakery items.  They appear to serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner all day.  If you're not sitting on the patio, the dining room is huge, lively, and a bit loud.  After brunch, I recommend hopping around some of the bars in the West Loop.  There is so much going on in "restaurant row" that you can easily spend the entire day here.
