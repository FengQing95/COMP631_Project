Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It's the best pizza in Chicago and possibly the world. I can't get enough of it. When I fly in from Kansas City, I bring a cooler to take these back to transplants back there. It's worth the effort. I stick to pepperoni though. If I want specialty pizzas or thin pizzas?", there are others. This is where you go for Chicago style. It is the best.
