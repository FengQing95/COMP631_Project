Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Um yum! Can't believe I've lived in Chicago for 2.5 years and had never been here. We went for restaurant week and it was a great deal and we got to try a good variety. The bacon wrapped dates, baked goat cheese, and short rib were amazing! The menu even included a glass of sangria, can't beat that. Definitely want to come back and try more of the menu. Being that it's tapas, it's a place you can revisit and have a totally different experience!
