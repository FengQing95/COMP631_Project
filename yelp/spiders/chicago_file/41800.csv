Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went with my wife and a couple of friends on a Saturday night.  The place was pretty busy when we arrived (9pm) but we were seated right away.  Maybe we got lucky as we had forgotten to make a reservation.  The drink selection was above average, the food was phenomenal.  Price was a little more than I expected, but not bad.
