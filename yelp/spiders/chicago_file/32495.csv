Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered a personal thick crust pizza, along with a thin crust pizza, wings, bruschetta, and pasta.  Everything was delicious.  It was top notch.  The service (thanks Ryan) was amazing.  We ordered the pizza ahead of time, so that aloud for the pizza to be almost completed by the time we were seated.  The atmosphere is great.  I would definitely come back for more.  I highly recommend Lou Malnati's Pizzaria on River North.
