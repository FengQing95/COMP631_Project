Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This ended up being the best breakfast I had while in Chicago. Very quaint. The entire restaurant was full of people, but we got a table very quickly and had great service throughout. While looking at the menu, the red velvet French toast caught my eye, so I decided to try it. WOW, was that a good decision. I'll keep this simple: any time I make my way back to Chicago in the future, I'm gonna stop here. I definitely recommend them.
