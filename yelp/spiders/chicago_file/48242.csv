Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I am never disappointed here. I usually go with a couple girlfriends to get some sangria (personally I like the regular old red sangria, but they have flavors too) and tapas and chat about life. It's always busy, but we don't mind because we just stalk people in the bar until they leave and take a table :-)
