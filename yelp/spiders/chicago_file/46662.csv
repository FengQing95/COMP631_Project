Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Why two stars instead of 3? The paella was horrible. We had the paella de mariscos. Me and my boyfriend have had this many times including the times in Spain and this was far most the worse paella we've ever had. The dish was VERY salty. Seafood can be salty by themselves and it tasted like they took a handful of Morton salt and dumped it on the paella (NO, seriously, that's how salty it was). We didn't really complain to management because we were running late for Blue Man Group (and our server was really slow) so we just paid our bill, left the leftovers, and bought a bottle of water at a nearby shop.
