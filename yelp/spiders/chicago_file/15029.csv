Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First timer to this or any other LM pizza place. Went on a Sunday night around 5:00 and the wait was about 45 minutes. Not as bad as we expected for a party of 6.  Had a beer while waiting and would have had more , but the bartender was too preoccupied with a couple of young ladies who got all his attention, hence 4 stars instead of 5. Can't blame him I guess.......hmmmmm, serve cuties sharing a tiny pizza at the bar , or a 50 something ordinary guy with a wad of cash and party of 6 thirsty and hungry people.  Just Sayin!!!
