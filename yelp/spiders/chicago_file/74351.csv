Little Goat Diner////Fluffy pancakes drizzled with yummy granola. I LOVE their oatmeal too. and their granola and yogurt with compote are all homemade. I love this place. I like to come mid-day on a weekday for a brunch on my own and get work done at their counter and watch the geniuses at work! I've even seen Stephanie there a couple times. (She offered some water to my dog, super sweet). Love this place over and over again!
