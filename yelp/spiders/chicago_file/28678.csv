Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It was my first time trying deep dish pizza and the best experience ever! You have to come early and check in to have a place in line for a table. You can also order ahead of time so when your table is seated you only have to wait 20 minutes for your pizza. We had the half The Lou (veggie) and half the Chicago Classic (sausage). It came out so hot and fresh. The crust is amazing. I also love that the crust doesn't get soggy with all those toppings! Definitely have to come here for pizza whenever you're in Chicago! Service was great. The environment def feels like a small family owned pizza spot! I would recommend 10/10. Thanks for the wonderful experience Lou Malnati's!
