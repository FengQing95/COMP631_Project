Smoque BBQ////But after enjoying a brisket sandwich with fries and cole slaw, I just couldn't do it. This is the best BBQ I've ever had. The brisket was tender, nicely placed on a fresh bun - and a fairly good amount of meat too. The sauce wasn't too hot or too sweet - it was right there - the perfect accommodation for beef that was so thoughtfully cooked. Fries were good and the cole slaw was delicious as well - sometimes vinegar cole slaws are a little harsh - this was just fine.
