Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pro Tip: Know the system and be prepared.  Walk in door, get in first line (NOT in front of cashier) and pick up menu. Decide what you want to eat.  Give your name and phone number to the hostess and she will text you when your table is ready.  Get in SECOND line, in front of cashier, and place your pizza order.  They'll cook it while you wait at the bar!  No room at the bar?  Walk one block down to the Pepper Canister and have a beer there - the hostess has your number and she'll text you when your table is ready.
