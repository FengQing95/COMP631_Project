Little Goat Diner////I had been to Girl and the Goat but not here and was excited to try it. I went on a Saturday around 5 o'clock without a reservation. It was very busy and there was a line of people waiting but I was by myself and was able to get a seat at the counter right away. My server was Shane; she had only been working there for a month but did a great job and was very knowledgeable. After some consultation with Shane, I got the bahn mi burger and was blown away by it. It had so many delicious flavors. For my side, I was deciding between the squash and the broccoli. I was hesitant to get the broccoli because the only dish I didn't care for at Girl and the Goat was the broccoli dish. Shane convinced me that the broccoli dish at the diner was very flavorful and I'm glad I ordered it because she was right. The only disappointment I had was the lack of interesting non-alcoholic drinks. Their cocktail menu was extensive but I did not see any mocktails. Otherwise, I had a wonderful visit and was impressed by the service and the food.
