Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////A great place to grab some pizza! But expect to wait at least 40 minutes for a table. That was the only exception but the wait was well worth it. The bar was quite small. When we got seated, we ordered a large thin crust cheese pizza and a half cheese half sausage pizza. I have to say it was the pizza in Chicago. Especially, you are going to run the Chicago Marathon.
