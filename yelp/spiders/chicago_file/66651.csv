Little Goat Diner////-Food was good. I had the "sloppy goat" sandwich and a side order of smoked fries. I was expecting a new experience in meat eating but it didn't seem that different than pork or chicken. Oh well, it was still good, perhaps not $12 sandwich good since it doesn't come with a side. FYI, it's all a la carte. The smoked fries were okay. Once again, nothing new or remarkable. My dinner guests had the french dip and the american burger. They liked their meals. I tried their mash potatoes. They were marginally better than the fries.
