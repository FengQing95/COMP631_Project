Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic personal sized pizza... because when in Rome right.. er Chicago.I was warned that it would have a lot of sausage, and they weren't kidding. It was tasty, but I wouldn't say I'm a fan of deep dish pizza. My heart and stomach is with thin crust pizza. Does anyone else feel like they are eating a casserole too?
