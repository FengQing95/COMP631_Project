Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My husband and I were really excited about coming here because we were just in Spain, so we were very familiar with the traditional tapas and wanted to see how it measured up.  The sangria was good, but tasted a lot like juice, so I switched to a Spanish Tempranillo which was delicious.  We started with some small bites, the shortrib stuffed in a pequillo pepper was amazing!  We got the Moorish chicken, calamari, and sweet potatoes.  All were really good.  The only major complaint I had was the octopus, which is one of my favorite dishes.  It was not only the most expensive dish we ordered, but the most disappointing.  It was way too salty, barely edible, and even after squeezing a ton of lemon juice, it was still difficult to eat.  I was really disappointed.  Other than that, I enjoyed the service, our waitress gave us a free round of desserts which were incredible.  I would come back again, but I will not be getting the octopus again.
