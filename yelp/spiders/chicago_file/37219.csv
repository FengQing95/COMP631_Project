Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is one of my favorite places in the city. However now I cannot get a table to save my life. I'll call a month ahead or try their online system but no luck. They are far too stuck up about their reservations. Bottom line they act completely pretentious. If you want a fabulous meal in Chicago, look else where. You will be treated like family not like someone who doesn't measure up.
