Art Institute of Chicago////I used to work a really early shift so I'd be done by 1 p.m., and every Wednesday I'd just go to the Art Institute until they kicked me out at 5. It's great to be able to take the time to really read about and examine each piece. If you're in a time crunch though, it is also feasible to Â see all of the major pieces in 2-3 hours.
