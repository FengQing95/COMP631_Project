Little Goat Diner////As for the food, the menu has a good selection with traditional brunch comfort food but with a twist. I definitely appreciate the quirks and thought that went into creating these dishes. I must say I was expecting a lot more just because of the hype surrounding the place. I got the "this little piggy went to china" and I would definitely recommend!
