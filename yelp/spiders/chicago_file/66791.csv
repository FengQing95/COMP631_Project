Little Goat Diner////I eat fairly healthy but do like to indulge sometimes, but this place was beyond indulgent.  I felt ill after eating only half my meal.  The food was extremely heavy and rich.  Everything tasted like it was cooked in butter or meat fat and had sugar added to it.  We had the nachos and they were beyond sweat, I couldn't stand it.  We also tried the sloppy goat.  I love goat meat, it's nice and lean, but this again was super sweat and really fatty because of the fat it was cooked in.
