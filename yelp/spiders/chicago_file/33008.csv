Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We sat for over three hours drinking and stuffing our faces.We shared oysters, tartare, fried chicken, beef tongue, pastrami veal, elote corn, sugar snap peas with ricotta and lemon and creamed spinach. Albeit almost everything was heavy and rich *you are at a steakhouse!* we left stuffed and happy. LOVE this place.
