Little Goat Diner////When visitors can't get a reservation at Girl and the Goat, they always ask me about Little Goat. I always tell them to check the menu. I wouldn't say Little Goat is a go-to, but they do have a solid menu. They have traditional things that diners usually do, but also an asian fusion. Just gotta see whether it piques your interest or not. For breakfast, I enjoy the chocolate chip pancakes, they're fluffy and not too sweet, which is the problem I encounter a lot.
