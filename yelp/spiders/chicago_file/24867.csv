Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I went to Chicago for a conference and this place was a must. Of course I had never tried deep dish and so my daughter and I stood in line for almost an hour to eat on one of their street side table, which we thought was nice to take in the city views and people watch. Â It was really delicious and one huge piece filled us up right away. We did a half pepperoni and half 'Lou', which is a spinach mix, mushrooms and sliced roma tomatoes covered with blend of mozzarella, romano and cheddar cheese on garlic Buttercrust. I got the minestrone soup because we were hungry and had to wait another 30+ mins because it took longer to make our custom half and half pizza. Next time you're in Chicago you must try it out.
