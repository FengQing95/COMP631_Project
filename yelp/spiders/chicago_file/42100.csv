Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba was pretty good!  I decided to go with the tapas while my bf got the pork tenderloin.  I ordered the grilled squid, salmon with couscous, grilled chicken w/ chorizo, and goat cheese of course.  I liked everything except for the chicken and chorizo, which was a chef's recommendation.  It wasn't anything special, oh, and I've also had better goat cheese.  But the squid and the salmon were excellent!!  I loved the couscous...I can probably eat a whole bowl of it!  The pork tenderloin arrived in a skewer and it was very tender and tasty.  I wish I could have tried their paella, but that would have been too much food.  No worries, I shall return!
