Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I don't know, guys. I am a transplant to Chicago, and I just don't get it. That makes sense right? Every time I have this pizza...it hurts my insides. Don't get me wrong...I keep trying, but even I am not foolish enough to injure myself over and over again. I recognize that this is a Chicago establishment, and I don't prefer deep dish (I prefer Dimo's, really). This particular location has good service and a nice staff. It does take a long time if you order deep dish (like most places).
