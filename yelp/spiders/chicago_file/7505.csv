Art Institute of Chicago////Alas, I've walked through Museo del Prado (Madrid), Le Louvre (Paris), and Tate (London).  I've come to realize that while the Art Institute is lovely, it doesn't have the depth comparable to its European counterparts.  Others may disagree, but this is based on personal observation.  However, it is still a wonderful place to go, and is a must for any visitor/local of Chicago.
