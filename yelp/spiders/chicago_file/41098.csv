Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////When I showed up I gave them my name from my reservation, and was told to go have a seat at the bar, and 2 steps later, they said they could seat us right now, I was like bonus. Great server, Maximillion.. Food was good. Fresh tuna, stuffed mushroms were awesome, Bacon an dates.... YUMMMMMMY. I had the sangria, very refreshing and light. I wasnt too happy with the ice in the pitcher, because that would water it down. I left full but not feeling bad. It was packed on a saturday night, so you might want to make a reservation. I think it was awesome for 2 or 4 but any more then that i wouldnt like it.
