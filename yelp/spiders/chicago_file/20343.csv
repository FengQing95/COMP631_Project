Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If ever your friends are in from out of town, it's only appropriate to give them exposure to proper Chicago fare. I was downtown and weighing several deep dish / stuffed locations, but Lou Malnati's seemed to be calling with a siren song. Don't get me wrong, I've been to Lou's and enjoy their thin crust and deep dish all the same and with a friend in from out of town it was time to try some of Chicago's best deep dish pizza.
