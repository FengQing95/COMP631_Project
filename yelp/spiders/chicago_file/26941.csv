Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First and foremost, Lou's was not terrible. I was expecting more dynamic and rich flavors, but instead I got something that was a tad mediocre. A girlfriend and I were in town for work, so we took a short walk to Lou's. The line was out the door! We walked in and reserved our names with an expected 1 hour wait. We were able to pre-order our pizza so that it would be ready by the time we sat down. Great, great idea; however, poorly executed.
