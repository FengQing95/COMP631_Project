Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I know a lot of people that rave about this restaurant, but it's nothing special to me.  The service I've had has always been terrible at best.  The food has been good, particularly the potato and octopus tapas, but nothing considerably amazing.  I do give a round of applause to the blackberry sangria, which has helped make every meal of mine at Ba-Ba-Reeba a success.
