Smoque BBQ////We had our food within minutes and our first taste of the extra smoky BBQ beans had us wishing we could get a bucket of them. Â Not that we would have had room with the substantial portion of ribs, brisket and the thick and creamy mac and cheese with a generous topping of crunchy crumbs. Even though I ate more than I should have, I kept sneaking a peak at the tiny side of individually baked peach cobbler on the tray next to me wishing I could just sneak a taste. Next time we're in Chicago, it would definitely be worth going back.
