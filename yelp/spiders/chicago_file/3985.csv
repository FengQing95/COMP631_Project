The Purple Pig////The Sweet Corn Polenta was delicious. It was pretty sweet, creamy, and the tartness of the passionfruit made the dish sing! The Milk Braised Pork was so tender and juicy it fell apart the second I put it in my mouth. It was all so creative and delicious. The only thing I didn't like was the cocktail but don't let that deter you, it was made well I just was being adventurous and picked the wrong cocktail for my taste.
