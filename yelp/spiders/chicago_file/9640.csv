Art Institute of Chicago////NOT AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY MUSEUM! Does not give opportunity for all students to volunteer, has a certain criteria. The Art Institute only wants you to volunteer if you fit THEIR criteria. Not if you are different. The Art Institute only provides opportunities to certain high school students, not all. It does not want al students to succeed. The museum is a beautiful place full of gorgeous art but full of prejudiced administration who does not care about students. I hope change comes and soon, because the next generation wants equal opportunity!!!
