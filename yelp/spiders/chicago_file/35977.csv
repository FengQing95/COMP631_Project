Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////- Bacon Roasted Tomato Salad: hot sliced tomatoes on the bottom with lots of bacon grease, then some strips of bacon that were very hard to chew, and the cold watercress on top. Components weren't mix well so they didn't integrate well. After you took a but of each, you then kind of had to make your own salad on your side plate. No one fought over who got the remains.
