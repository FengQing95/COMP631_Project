Smoque BBQ////It's the perfect place to go for ribs, brisket, pulled pork, chicken, texas sausage, and your favorite country sides all under one roof... and the best part is that they allow BYOB. So you can sit there chill with your friends, make yourself some cocktails while you wait for your food. I like that there's no waiters/waitresses, it's counter service - you order, u pick up your food, grab a seat and chow down.
