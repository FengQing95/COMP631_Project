Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The build your own bloody mary bar seemed interesting as you can put whatever skewer shit you want in there as the server gives you a shot a vodka. I saw a guy with like 6 skewers jammed in his cup! Where we were seated, I don't think I would've made it down the stairs, to the left, between all the tables, servers running around, just to get to the corner of the bar without falling after my BAC is probably above the legal limit in my state. I settled with the classic red sangria which wasn't too sweet, quite strong, and topped with fruit. It was tasty and I soon found out I felt buzzed, walking down a few steps to the women's bathroom which had 3 stalls, 1 sink, and I couldn't effing see anything in there let alone find the TP in the stall. The girls line was long when I came out. I'm assuming these girls had one too many drinks and needed to tinkle bad like me.
