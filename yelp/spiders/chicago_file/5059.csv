The Purple Pig////Aside from that last dish, I would order any of the dishes again. Food comes out promptly in no particular order (per host) and piping hot. I broke my pescetarian fast and had some of the Ossabuco - it was heavenly! The meat pulled off the bone so easily and the goblets of fat melted in your mouth. It was generously doused with tomato and polenta sauces. The Octopus was one of the best dishes I've ever had. Extemely tender and meaty inside but nicely charred on the outside. Red snapper was fresh, nicely charred and delish with a red cabbage sauce that was tart and sweet at the same time (looked and tasted akin to poi, lol). The Empanadas were also yummy, just consider this a dessert rather than an appetizer.
