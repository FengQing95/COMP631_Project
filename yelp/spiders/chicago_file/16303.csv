Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I almost forgot--the service/experience of actually WAITING to dine here. The wait was about an hour, however their system is genius. They take your order after you put your name on the wait list so that once you're seated, the pizza only takes about 15-20 minutes to come out. A flawless plan.
