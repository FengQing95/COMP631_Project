Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////We had to wait an hour for a table, but the whole group thought it was well worth the wait.  The food was all delicious.  I had the napa omelet with gluten free honey cakes, and it was great.   The omelet was bacon, scallions, figs and havarti.   Odd combo but it really did work.   Others had skillets and cinnamon roll pancakes that looked delish too.
