Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It took us a few months to get our reservations, however it was worth the wait.  I was very impressed with the location/ decor, definitely a unique experience.  The steak was on par with comparable options.  I'd suggest the goat cheese appetizer and iceberg salad, both were excellent.  Service was above average and very friendly.
