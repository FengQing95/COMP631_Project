Art Institute of Chicago////I have visited Chicago now on a number of occasions. It's my favorite city east of California. It has many, many fantastic attractions to entertain the vacationer, chief among them its splendid museums.  Of them all, I admit that I harbor an irrational love the MoSI above the rest.  It is, however, a museum of narrow focus, and some people, even dear friends, loathe it.
