Art Institute of Chicago////What not to see: Many elements of the Edlis collection, especially the works by Koons and Hirst. All ego from the artists, galleries, and collectors convincing themselves that this stuff is important. Sorry for the cliche, but the emperor wears no clothes. (That being said, the Lichtenstein and Twombly in their collection are both incredible so I'm not a total hater).
