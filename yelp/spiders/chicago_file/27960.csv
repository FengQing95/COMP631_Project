Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It's okay. Lou Malnati's is a common choice when you ask natives where to get your one tourist deep dish from, and it's okay at best. There's a ton of little places around that make better pizza than the Chicago institutions. Two that are probably in delivery range are Fat Chris's and ORD. They have some great pizza.
