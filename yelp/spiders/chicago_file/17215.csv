Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////IMO the best Chicago style deep dish pizza!! I like how certain locations offer take away that you can bake at home.  We had a great experience here and we loved our pepperoni deep dish.  We came starved and ate the whole thing. Came in during the week around Christmas time and had no wait.  Keep up the good work!
