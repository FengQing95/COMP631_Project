Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////About 60 minutes after we originally ordered it (we had ordered another round of drinks in the meantime), our pizza arrived and it was simply stunning. So cheesy, so garlicky, so damn tasty. Every bite was an explosion of flavor -- a revelation. I've eaten a lot of pizza at a lot of places over the years, including Italy, and this was easily in the top-3 ever. Â Perhaps the very best.
