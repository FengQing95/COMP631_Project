Little Goat Diner////Value:  We were there a total of three hours including the wait.  All of this fun cost a mere $45, plus a $10 tip for Ezra, plus $10 bucks for the valet.  What?  $10 bucks to park a car on Randolph and Halsted on Saturday afternoon?  Yup!  Be careful of the legal-looking parking space trap in front of LG.  The sign indicating Valet Parking is half a block to the right of LG.  The valet appears out of nowhere after you've unwittingly grabbed that beckoning parking space.  Since you don't have a clue how long the wait is, once you've committed your ride to the valet, your stuck with the wait.
