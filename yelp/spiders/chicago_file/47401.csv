Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I do recommend the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, but stay away from the shrimp and grits; it's not at all what you think it's gonna be. Also, the chicken and waffle stick is more like a chicken sausage corn dog; again not what one would expect from reading the name of it on the menu.
