Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is a staple of North side Spanish food. Every time I go here I always have something new and wonderful. The potatoes and all the seafood are especially good. My mouth is watering and my stomach is rumbling just thinking about Ba-Ba-Reeba. You have to check out he sangria. I love all the flavors but the peach is especially good. This place is perfect for a great dinner and lots of sangria before you try your salsa dancing out on the town.
