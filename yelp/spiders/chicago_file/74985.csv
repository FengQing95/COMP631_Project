Little Goat Diner////Sometimes I regret going out to eat because I know I could have produced something much more interesting/delicious at home.  In this case, I could never have produced something this good in what I would consider normal, reasonable dinner preparation time.  Moreover, it would have taken far too much creative effort and thinking.
