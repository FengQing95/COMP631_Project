Smoque BBQ////Giving Smoque BBQ one star likely won't persuade many people here, so please consider this review a reminder to demand your food be properly prepared. I've been to Smoque three times -- two of which I was served meat that was very much overcooked. Ribs and brisket are supposed to be moist and tender, not DRY and TOUGH.
