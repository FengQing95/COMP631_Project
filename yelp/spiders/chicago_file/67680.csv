Little Goat Diner////Great food.  so-so service.  so my cousin and I decide to stop in here since we were nearby and hungry. we are seated almost immediately at the counter.  a young gentleman with tattoo sleeves greets us then takes our drink orders.  later he comes back to get the food order but we were not ready.  so he disappears for 10 minutes then finally comes back and takes our order.  and so we wait...and wait...and wait....meanwhile we are sitting opposite the kitchen and I can see our food just sitting under the warmer.  at some point someone tells the runner that my chicken tenders have 1 minute or they will have to be redone.  they finally get to me...and i can say they are the best homemade chicken tenders I have ever had. Our sever checks with us 2x before we have even started really eating then vanishes. so eventually we finish eating and we wait...and wait...and wait....until eventually the same tattooed gentleman brings the bill.  no "is there something else I can get you?"  or "any room for dessert?".  just a check.  Thank goodness there was a really hot runner nearby for me to look at because those chicken tenders alone would not have been enough to save the meal.  They were good but not wait 20 minutes for the check good.
