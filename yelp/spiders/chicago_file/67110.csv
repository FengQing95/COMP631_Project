Little Goat Diner////The cheesy hash browns and bacon and scrambled eggs and biscuit were very yummy. Fried chicken was great, maybe a little heavy on the batter but the meat was moist and tasty.  Nachos were good but massive - too much to eat.   Desserts were awesome as well - lemon curd tart and strawberry shortcake - awesome.  Missed the bakery (they closed just as we got there).
