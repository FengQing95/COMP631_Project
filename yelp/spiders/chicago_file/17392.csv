Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First of all, the bartender totally ignored us for more than 10 minutes. When we asked what kind of wine they had, we were handed a list and waited another 10 minutes before we could order. Figuring that was a sign of the service, we ordered a pizza quickly, and chose thin crust, thinking it would take less time than Chicago style. Wrong again. We waited for 40 minutes for the pizza to arrive and when it did, it was obviously NOT fresh from the oven, but cold.
