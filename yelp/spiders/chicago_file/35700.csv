Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////What can I say about Bavette's that has not already been said NOTHING!!!  But why would I let that stop me?  We have been going here since the first week it opened in August 2012.  This is my go to spot. I keep at least one or two reservations on the books at all times and try to sit at the downstairs or upstairs bar in-between my formal reservations.  I love everything about this place and did I mention that I don't like traditional steakhouses?  I will go on and on about this place to anyone that will listen and then say I don't like steakhouses!
