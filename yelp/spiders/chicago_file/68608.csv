Little Goat Diner////To more of my point, the food here simply did not blow me away or make me say, "Gee golly fellas, this joint sure is keen! This was certainly worth the wait!" I ordered a fruit cup for my grumpy, hungover friend which was decent, but cost $6 for some chopped pieces of fruit, which is kinda ridiculous, and i ordered the Biscuits and gravy. Now in reference to the caveat above, I think I goofed by ordering this since typically, I don't even read the description of BISCUITS & GRAVY since the recipe is pretty f****** simple (bizkitz + greyvi + sawsij = mee sew hapee). Upon receiving my food though, there were a few major issues.
