Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////An amazing steakhouse in the river north area. The food is great, the atmosphere is even better. The service is where we're losing the star. It wasn't the worst service but I set my expectations pretty high when we're spending $600 on a table of four. Our steaks came out before our salad course and we had to send them back, our drinks were empty for over 15 minutes and we struggled to flag anyone down for more. I will have to say the server seemed overwhelmed with his tables. He was going back and forth between the pos and his tables instead of checking on all his tables at once. I think if he were to do that everyone would be getting better service and he could handle the rush better. He was very nice, knowledgeable, and made great recommendations on the plus side.
