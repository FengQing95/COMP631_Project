Smoque BBQ////The best BBQ restaurant that I have found in Chicago in my 4 years of living here.  (And I'm from Memphis, so I know my BBQ.)  The meat is tender, well-seasoned, and reasonably priced. I have tried the pulled pork, ribs, smoked sausage, and brisket, and none have disappointed me thus far. The mac and cheese is fantastically buttery, the fries are cooked from freshly sliced potatoes, the slaw is fresh and vinegary but not too much so, and if you can squeeze any room for the peach cobbler, I highly recommend doing so.
