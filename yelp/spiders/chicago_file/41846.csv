Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I personally think Cafe BBR is a bit overrated. The first time I went I had a nice experience (nothing too stellar but good overall) and decided to make reservations once again for a last minute birthday dinner. It wasn't too crowded or noisy which was a plus, but the food left something to be desired. The grilled calamari was fishy and extremely over salted, and the seared tuna was overcooked, as were the lamb skewers. I was irritated because I could have made those much better myself and I am no chef! I kind of felt like the chefs know that this place already has a good reputation and don't need to put much effort into the food for people to rave, even if they are raving for absolutely no reason. That being said, I still had an enjoyable time; however, the next time my tapas craving hits I will be stopping by Twist in Lakeview.
