Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's is my favorite deep dish pizza place. I get the Chicago style deep dish which has a butter crust, sausage, extra cheese, and the right amount of seasoning. Giordano's is good, but I find it too be too salty. Ricobene's is decent, but their breaded steaks are better. Doesn't matter which Lou Malnati's you go to they all taste the same.
