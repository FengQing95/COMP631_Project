Little Goat Diner////We also got the Brandade and Belly. Too be honest, there was just too much going on on one plate here. Again, the idea was good but I just don't think the meal followed through. There was belly pork, biscuits, kimchi, brandade and fried eggs on the plate. I do have to say though, I enjoyed the kimchi because it wasn't too spicy even though you would expect kimchi to be a lot spicer.
