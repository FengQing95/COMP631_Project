Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My last experience was so good but the server today ruined it. Last time was my first time dining here, and everything was perfect (the food and excellent server)! I was soooo looking forward to coming back so I recommended this place to my friends for one of us's farewell dinner since she was leaving town.
