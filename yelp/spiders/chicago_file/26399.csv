Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnatis was my first exposure to deep dish and boy did I take a... Deep dive. The menu is pretty simple, with salads, apps, and of course, deep dish. Each pie takes about 30 minutes to bake, and seem to go longer on busy days. And it was busy the entire time we were there. I got the vibe that the waitress wanted us in and out when she constantly offered to take our plates. Oh well, I guess Chicago just moves faster.
