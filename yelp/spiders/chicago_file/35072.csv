Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Came here for my boyfriends birthday! Did not have any reservations but if you get here right when they open, there are a few free tables. Immediately stared with some drinks crab cake for an appetizer. Delicious! I had the chicken as an entree and it was juicy and tender! The BF had the steak. We both enjoyed two drinks each and my oh my were they strong! Definitely coming back here. The staff was so welcoming!
