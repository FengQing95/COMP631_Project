Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered The Lou, small and it was pretty awesome. I was worried b/c I had never heard of this place. The crust makes a pizza for me and this had the right amount of everything. It was light, yet crispy, flavored and some how managed to melt in your mouth which is not usually the case with deep dish pizzas. The cheese to sauce ratio was spot on. Some places don't need a lot to say how great they are so... Nuff said.
