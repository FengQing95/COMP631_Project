Smoque BBQ////The rib combo was pretty good with me liking their St. Louis ribs just a tiny bit more than their baby backs. Typically, I'm usually more of a baby back guy. The mac and cheese, fries, and cornbread were okay. The texas sausage was pretty good and had a nice snap to it. The takeaways for me were the sliced brisket and the pecan bread pudding.
