Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband got the special, chicken pot pie. It came with a totally unnecessary but very much appreciated side of mashed potatoes. I was surprised this wasn't a regular menu item, because it was delicious! Flaky puff pastry, stuffed with roasted chicken, carrots, peas, and gravy... very hearty and comforting.
