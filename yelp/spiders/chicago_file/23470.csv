Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm really not sure why!! If you like fake bacon bits on your salad and velveta cheese in place of cheese curds for the fried cheese appetizer, then you may like this resturant. They are extremely slow, so plan to spend the whole evening there . The waitress dropped the pan holder on the floor and and just picked it up and reused it, with out cleaning it. If you want good Chicago style pizza , skip this place and go to Giordano's. You'll be much happier , and they'll feed you real foods , not fake processed ones .
