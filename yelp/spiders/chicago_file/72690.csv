Little Goat Diner////Looooove this place! Separate bar area while you wait is fun. They have beer they have brewed specifically for Little Goat. I waited an hour to be seated when I came in at 8pm on a Thursday. Not too bad but I had a feeling there would be a wait. Did not detract from the overall experience though.
