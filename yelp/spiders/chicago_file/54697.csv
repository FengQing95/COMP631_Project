Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Big place and always busy. Great food to chow down slowly while having conversations with friends. They brought the dish as they were prepared not all your orders at once which I think it is interesting that you can enjoy it slowly and keep the surprise coming. I would recommend this place to all.
