The Purple Pig////The amount of food we ordered was perfect. Our server sold us on their Filet Mignon special that evening, served on top of whipped purple potatoes, and we were sold. Unfortunately they were actually out of bone marrow that day - we were told their shipment arrived mid-afternoon and the timing was too tight to have them prepared. Â We were actually talking up a storm about how great the marrow was, since our friends we were dining with just moved to Chicago and was excited about the food scene. Even without the highly anticipated bone marrow, everything was 10/10.
