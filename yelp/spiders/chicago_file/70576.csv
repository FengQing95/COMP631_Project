Little Goat Diner////This is a wonderful place to grab a wifi and delish bite to eat. I have been here now three times and I've never been disappointed with my choices. For breakfast, I would recommend the bull's eye French toast. Eggs, crispy chicken, BBQ maple syrup and strawberries. For something filling but lighter, try the chickpea, a huge salad that comes with falafel (even if not listed on the menu). Affordable, tasty place to bring family and friends with minimal wait time!
