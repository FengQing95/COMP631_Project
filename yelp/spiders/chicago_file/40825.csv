Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have only been here for brunch recently but have really liked it both times. They have a wonderful bloody mary bar that includes your choice of about a dozen premium vodkas, choice of 3 tomato juices of varying spice, and then all kinds of stuff like shrimp/celery/spicy meat/veggies. Much better than other breakfast places. The brunch is tapas style and they have a number of wonderful options including sides of silver dollar sized tiny pancakes on a skewer. Many of the tapas are pretty rich and filling so I would suggest ordering in waves rather than loading up out of the gate.
