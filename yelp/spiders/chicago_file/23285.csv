Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Me and my fiance saw this place on yelp with the highest rating. We went there it was crowded..so ordered to go.. 2 personal pizzas of their specialties. It was over priced but not as much as Gino's East. Paid almost $50 with the addition of a couple of toppings. The wait was a little long but we understand they were busy. The pizza was good...had it for leftovers the next was not bad.
