Little Goat Diner////This place was great we only had a 25 minute wait when they quoted 35-45 on a Saturday around 2:00pm. Our server immediately recommended her favs since it was our first time we ordered the root beer float, tempura mashed potatoes, cheeseburger, patty melt and the los drowned. All were a little messy, but full of flavor and finger licking good. Big portions make everything perfect for sharing.
