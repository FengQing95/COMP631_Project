Little Goat Diner////Justin, after dropping cocktail and beers, returned W a sandwich that thankfully my wife turned her nose up at. My daughter Abbey and I dove straight in and were flabbergasted at the perfection of this pork cutlet Korean slaw concoction!! Â The wifey couldn't stand our looks of amazement and continued to dive in and eat the other half on her own. Much to our dismay.
