Little Goat Diner////When the waitress returned to our table my friend tells her that her breast is not cooked all the way through. The waitress proceeds to tell us that it's "just the way they cook it". We all give her a weird look - I have NEVER been told a restaurant intentionally under cooks their chicken. That's just asking for serious bacterial issues. My friend explains no, I cook. I fry chicken. This is not how it should be cooked. Again, she insists that this is the way it's done because of the type of bird they use and that it's very expensive. It's at this point that my friend takes hold of the breast with one hand and uses her fork to pry the meat apart. It takes enough effort that her hand started shaking and she says "Cooked chicken doesn't do that," The waitress was very annoyed and said ok I will see if they will cook it longer, if I like and grabs the plate and storms off.
