Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love the ambiance inside when its dark and mysterious and outside when the outdoors are nice and breezy. The wait staff is friendly and always willing at a moment's notice to explain more or less the whole menu down to itty bitty bits. Their ceviche's are very well flavored and the food comes out quickly. Their white sangrias tend to taste better IMO than their red ones but better is a relative word since they're ALL good.
