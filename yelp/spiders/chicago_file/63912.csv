Smoque BBQ////Being as I live in Texas, I regretfully admit this bbq is better than any I've had before. Came here last October to run Chicago Marathon and this was my pre race meal. Wasn't too pleased about standing in line for 30 min but it was worth it. Had the pork ribs, mac n cheese, and brisket chili. It was literally one of the most delicious meals I've had in my life. Will definitely be back.
