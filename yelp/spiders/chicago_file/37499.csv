Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Came late one evening had had a great time. The decor and ambiance is like steeping into a different era. The food we had was all very good and they brought out my dates steak so fast you would have thought the world was coming to an end. I enjoyed my drink and would recommend this place to anyone.
