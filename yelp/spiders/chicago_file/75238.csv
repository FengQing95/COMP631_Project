Little Goat Diner////I did my research on restaurants in Chicago and chose Little Goat to celebrate my birthday as well as 6 month milestone of my first pregnancy. I had family members from out of town and various parts of the city come together to celebrate. Little Goats IRRESPONSIBLE policy turned a celebratory event into an unfortunate night that ruined a special evening for my family and I.
