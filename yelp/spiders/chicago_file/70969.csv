Little Goat Diner////Have eaten here numerous times and the food here is always on point. U get great quality and quantity for the money. It's a diner so you can have lunch, dinner or breakfast whenever you want. I absolutely love the chocolate pancakes, fried chicken, mashed potatoes with gravy, patty melt and the fish tostadas. Those are just my top but there is nothing I haven't tried that wasn't amazing and full of flavor. I also love their ice tea cocktail. It is often packed on a daily but wait is never too long.
