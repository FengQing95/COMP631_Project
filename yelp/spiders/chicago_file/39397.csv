Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Pricing: $$$$ definitely an expensive night out. But that being said, I didn't feel that anything wasn't worth what we paid. Portions are large for the price and the quality is superb. When you pay this much for a meal, you want everything to be to your liking, and I can honestly say it was.
