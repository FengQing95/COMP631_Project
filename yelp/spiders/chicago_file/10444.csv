Art Institute of Chicago////We used the Valet Parking available at the Art Institute as we had Grandma who needed a wheelchair. The parking attendant was wonderful. At $28 it was one of the best parking values in the city. The wheelchair was available just inside the door at the service desk and it was no problem to bring it out to the car for Grandma. We spent the day seeing the collections throughout the museum. Every inch was accessible to us via elevators. Do not hesitate to visit the Art Institute if you are looking for accessibility. Enjoy!!
