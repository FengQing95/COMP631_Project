Art Institute of Chicago////The part the surprised me the most were the exhibits downstairs. There was an entire room dedicated to paperweights. I didn't know that was a thing, but apparently even Truman Capote was a collector. There's another room that's titled Miniatures but it's more like dioramas. They're AMAZING. I was incredibly impressed by the dedication the artists put into every little detail. That was perhaps the highlight for me, because I don't know any other museum in the world that has this. And if there are others, please PM me cause I'd love to check those out.
