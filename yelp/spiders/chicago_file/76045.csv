Little Goat Diner////Upon entering, you're greeted by a majestic Diner that's reminiscent of some of the old school spots you see in small towns, and while maintaining the rustic charm, it's got a very cool vibe that you'd expect from a place of this caliber. Hipster trending, but not pretentious - very good stuff!
