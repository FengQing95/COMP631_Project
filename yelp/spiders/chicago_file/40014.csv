Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////By far the absolute best restaurant I've been to hands down! The service was superb, the food was delectable and the ambiance was so nice. A friend and I had the roasted chicken, ( I don't eat steak ) the lamb chops, the truffle Mac, creamed spinach and the baked goat cheese. All of which were delicious. I've been to quite a few restaurants and this one has earned ever star given . I can't wait to go back !
