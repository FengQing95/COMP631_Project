Little Goat Diner////- Rushed service: I think the entire restaurant was running behind (perhaps this happens a lot here). So as a result, everything was rushed. Waitress came by to take our plates when I was done but my friend was clearly still eating. Waitress swooped in to take our check when I had just set down my credit card but my friend was still fetching hers, leaving me to get up and run after her. Waitress promised to check with kitchen on cooking my steak medium before placing my order and didn't!
