Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It's not as overwhelming as I expected- truly a pizza "pie". There's plenty of filling, but wasn't a mouthful of tomato sauce. The dough is soft and chewy, and the cheese is perfectly melted. It's not the most amazing pizza I've tasted in my life, but no Chicago visit/life is complete without at least trying this famous slice/wedge!
