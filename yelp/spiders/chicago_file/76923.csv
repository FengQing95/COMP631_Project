Little Goat Diner////I got the veggie quesadilla, hold the smoked blueberries.   Smoked anything tastes like meat and definitely not what I want.  It was good, but the cheese wasn't as melted as it should have been, and was a tad too oily.  It came with eggplant inside, and radishes on top.  Some bites of eggplant didn't taste fully cooked.  I also had a side of the cheesy hash browns.  They were good, but after the 4th bite, I had had enough.
