Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I loved Cafe Ba Ba Reeba! And so did my whole party! It wasn't dirty at all like some said, and the service was great! We were sitting in what we thought was a bit of a draft and we asked to move, even though it was pretty busy, and without a single roll of the eye, we were moved to a warmer area. Our server was very friendly and helpful, and that was much appreciated since none of us had been before.
