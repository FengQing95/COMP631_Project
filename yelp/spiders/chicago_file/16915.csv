Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Service and location are great. The garden salad was not good. The veggies didn't taste fresh and the red wine vinaigrette was very oily. The pizza was good (classic, add spinach), but extremely salty. Everyone had dry mouth the entire evening/night after and woke up parched.
