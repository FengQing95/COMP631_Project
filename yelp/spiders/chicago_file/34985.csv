Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My family and I have been pining for Bavette's since we first went there two and a half years ago and had the best meal of our lives. We finally found ourselves back in Chiacgo this spring break, and of course, the minute we decided to go to Chicago, we made a reservation at Bavette's. To be honest, we were a little nervous about whether it would live up to our high expectations - did the gloss of memory sweeten the experience, we asked ourselves? I'm happy to report, dear reader, that Bavette's lived up to our expectations, and then some. The Bacon, which we discuss almost every time we've eaten bacon in the past 2+ years, was as mouthwateringly delicious as we remembered. (I capitalize "Bacon" in this context because it deserves that level of respect.) Do not hesitate to order it as an appetizer even if that seems a little indulgent when you're about to eat a massive steak. Â It's important you eat this Bacon. And when combined with a slightly roasted tomato in the tomato-Bacon salad, the result is sheer perfection. We ordered both plain Bacon and the salad without hesitation. The steak is, truly, the best I've ever had anywhere. We paired ours with the corn, Brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes and spinach, and despite the ensuing pain of having gorged ourselves beyond recognition, we could not have been happier. (I personally wish the mashed potatoes were garlic free, but I'm an outlier on this - our kids LOVE them.) Even the bread, soft and warm and served with warm butter, is irresistable.
