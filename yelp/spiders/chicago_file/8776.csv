Art Institute of Chicago////It was pretty spectacular. Upon hearing it was the second biggest museum in the US, I didn't really know what to expect. Did they have a bit of everything? Yes. Everything from Chagall stained glass to Pollack, Byzantine pottery, Eygptian ruins and beyond, was truly amazing to see. The NYC photography exhibit and the bright and airy Modern Wing was especially fascinating.
