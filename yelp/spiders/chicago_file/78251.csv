Little Goat Diner////I don't think I've ever encountered a diner that serves Asian fusion cuisine! I was really surprised to see asian dishes such as "Bi Bim Bop" next to Southern Comfort dishes such as "Shrimp and Cheesy Grits". I was even further surprised to see that multiple East Asian countries are represented on the menu (Chinese, Korean, Japanese, etc...) because restaurants that cook fusion usually just choose two countries in order to create a more cohesive menu.
