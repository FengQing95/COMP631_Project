Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My husband and I came for a short visit to Chicago this week. I knew this place was top on my list. We had a late reservation, but arrived early and decided to just dine at the bar after getting drinks. The bar staff were very attentive and entertaining. We had a great time watching them make amazing cocktails. I enjoyed Bavette's Punch and it well exceeded my expectations. The homemade bread that was brought out before dinner was to die for and tasted just like the kind my mother used to make. I ordered the petite filet and my husband the larger filet. As a side we ordered Elotes Loco and Pomme Frite. Both main courses were inarguably for both the best filets we had ever had (we eat a ton of filet and make a fun game out of rating them each time at different establishments). Elotes Loco was a standout for me and husband said he enjoyed the Pomme Frites a great deal. BÃ©arnaise was out of this world tasty. An amazing experience and we will for sure be back for out #1 Filet.
