Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I came here for brunch on Sunday (and maybe that was my mistake), but I didn't think the food was that spectacular.  The service was okay, but they were kind of slow and not very friendly or engaging.  We had the sausage-fried paella rice with poached egg, iberico ham hash, beef tenderloin eggs benedict, and grilled octopus.  Nothing special to write home about.
