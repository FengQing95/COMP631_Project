Little Goat Diner////The service can be a little hit or miss, but it's mostly a hit.  Jessica is amazing, and whenever she's working, we try to make sure we end up in her area.  (Jessica, you're so great!)  When Jessica's not around...I feel like smaller tables sometimes get ignored at the expense of larger groups, at least in my experience.
