Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was our first Chicago pizza experience, I thought the dough would be a little more deep dish if you will meaning I thought it would be a little thicker.  Based on the waitresses recommendation we got a half cheese half special, which it had a sausage base. My husband thought that the sausage was an overkill and pretty much thought he was eating just a layer of sausage on his pizza.   My half with just cheese was pretty decent, I was happy with it and the flavor that came with and the buttery crust.
