Little Goat Diner////We sat at the counter and if your a diner fan like I am than you know this is the place to be. A very energetic atmosphere.  The staff was simply amazing.  Our primary server was very attentive and helpful.  The POS went on the fritz shortly after we sat down.  Due to everyone needing to hand in tickets and needing to hang around for orders me and my buddy basically met and and talked with most of the staff at some point including Chef Izard.  If the food was average I would still come back for the service.. it was that good.
