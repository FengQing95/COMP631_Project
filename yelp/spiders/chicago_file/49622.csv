Smoque BBQ////WHAT HAPPENED ??!!! you know.. I think when Time Out Chicago had one of Smoques Mouth Watering Briskett Sandwhiches on their front page, maybe then Smoque was pulling out all of the stops.. after they got the exposure, they have gone down hill. Now I'm from KC.. the BBQ Place and although I didn't expect it to be Gates or some other place, I wanted this to be decent. The beef sandwhich was OK but everytime i took a bite, there was a huge clump of soggy FAT on it. Like they Â forgot to Trim the FAT before they began to cook the meat. I know that they can't reach all of it but DAYUM!!! .. Their beans were just ok. and their fries were just ok as well. nothing to scream about and certainly not worth me paying $24 for 2 kids meals and an adult meal.. ohh and what GALLS do they have making sure that there is a TIP Jar by the Cashier.. WHAT are we Tipping for again ?
