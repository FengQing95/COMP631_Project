Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went here based on recommendations from friends and I have to say I did not understand all the hype about it. The food was ok for the amount of money each item costs. The garlic shrimp was something I could have easily made at home. They do have some exceptional items but for the most part I was disappointed.
