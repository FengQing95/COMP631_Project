Little Goat Diner////Prepare to wait for brunch. Service was good but to be told I couldn't request my eggs over medium versus sunny side up was a joke. "We don't allow ANY modifications on either of these items...but you can do it on these..."  Seriously?!  I ended up with their version of chicken and waffles...but it was French toast that was more like custard in the middle and a generic chicken finger chopped on top.
