Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Incredible deep dish pizza you can only get in Chicago. We ordered the Lou with sausage. Incredible. Highly recommend getting on waitlist before heading to the restaurant and pre ordering your pie at that time. We went on Friday night at 6:30 and we were seated by 7:00 and our pizza arrived about 20 minutes later. Excellent beer selection and very friendly staff.
