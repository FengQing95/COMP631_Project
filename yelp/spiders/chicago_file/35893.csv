Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This restaurant is amazing. From the moment you walk in you know you are in for a special night! The crab cake was one of the best I have ever had, delicate and flavorful with a perfect crust! The wedge salad is not a typical wedge, it was amazing and the bacon, perfect! Â Our bartender Shiz was the real deal! She was a perfect hostess and so knowledgeable about the menu. Great drinks and a fun personality that just made the night so fun!
