The Purple Pig////Waiter #1 put down one of our dishes and waiter #2 put down our second dish. However before waiter #2 walked away, he questioned us if we ordered our first dish more than once. When we confirmed that we did order the dish (or else why would waiter#1 know to drop it off at our table?) he asked us if we were sure in the most condescending tone. We felt like he thought we were not being truthful and trying to just take the dish or something. It was extremely rude and offensive. Should he have questioned us if he didn't even know what we ordered in the first place? He even went to our waiter who took down our order to confirm if we ordered our dish. I felt extremely singled out because of this.
