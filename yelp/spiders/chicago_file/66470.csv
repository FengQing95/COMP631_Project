Little Goat Diner////The menu is huge, so I definitely need to go back several times. Plus they serve breakfast all day so that was really tempting. We started with fried pickles which I've had at many places, but these were definitely top notch. The batter was light and the pickles had great flavor. I also ordered a Tiramisu milkshake. I really didn't taste any of the familiar tiramisu flavors, but that aside it was an excellent shake with super rich homemade whipped cream. For my lunch entree I ended up with Los Drowned, a fantastic spin on a french dip with deliciously braised beef and a fresh and flavorful medley of toppings. The hoagie roll was perfect, and it made me really curious to check out Little Goat Bread. This woman knows her way around braising meats, as I experienced at Girl & The Goat, so it was a wise choice. We ended with the apple pie a la mode, which had cheddar cheese shredded and melted onto the top crust. The ice cream was so rich and creamy, and the apple pie itself was really homey. I would say that describes the food here in general - homey with a twist.
