Smoque BBQ////Everything looked tasty so I was in a bind. I was eating for one today and I wanted everything. So I ordered taste portions of brisket, pulled pork, texas sausage, mac/cheese, and cole slaw.  The brisket is fall-apart good. The pulled pork was a tad dry.  The sausage took home the grand prize! It's smoky, garlicky and very flavorful.  The casing is crunchy and a good thickness.  The mac and cheese was definitely unbelievably tasty. The cole slaw is NOT creamy and heavy on the vinegar. I love it but I can see how those from Chicago don't really like it.  I do miss one thing that Texan bbq places always have with their bbq...PICKLES!
