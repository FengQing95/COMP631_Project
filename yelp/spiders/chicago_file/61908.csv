Smoque BBQ////The title for best pulled pork belongs to my Uncle Gordie in Boynton Beach, FL, who injects his pork butt with pineapple juice, before slow smoking it for 6 hours, and finishing it in the oven for another 3. Â Smokelicious and bark-tastic and served with a South Carolina mustard-based sauce that would make shoe leather taste good.
