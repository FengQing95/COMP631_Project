The Purple Pig////Every time I am in Chicago, I stop by Purple Pig. This place has a great atmosphere. The food is delicious and the service is superb. I was seated within 5 minutes. The server constantly check up on me if I needed anything and all of the food that I ordered were great. I ordered the bone marrow, pork liver pate, pork belly and mussels. Out of all of the dishes my favorite is the pork belly and bone marrow. The pork belly was so juicy and tender and just melts when you take a bite. There is also a ginger glaze on it which makes the flavor pairing so well. I also enjoyed the bone marrow with a pinch of sea salt on the bread makes the perfect flavor. I would recommend this restaurant every time you come to Chicago.
