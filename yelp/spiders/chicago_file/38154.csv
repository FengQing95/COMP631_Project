Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Never as good as the first time but pretty darn close. It was remarkably tender and extremely flavorful. The bernaise sauce was the perfect compliment. Also, the waiter offered to have it sliced which we happily accepted. ...And it was cheaper this visit. $68.95; down from $76.
