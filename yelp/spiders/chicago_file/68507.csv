Little Goat Diner////We got great bar seats and started with the shrimp cocktail (which was Delish).  Bartenders are knowledgable and offer fantastic service.  We ordered the pork belly sandwich and sloppy goat which should become staple items to get here.  I could smash 10-12 of those sandwiches...but that's because I always eat until I hate myself.
