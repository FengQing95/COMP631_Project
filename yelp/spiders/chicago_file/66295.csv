Little Goat Diner////While the servers were fantastic, atmosphere cute, the food was so unimpressive that I can only give this one star. The Los Drowned that I'd heard so much about was not really worth the calories. I split it with someone and didn't bother to finish it. The rest of the food was just ok, nothing special or exciting. I'd go back for a drink at the bar, but that's about it. Not impressed.
