Art Institute of Chicago////Art is the most intensely personal experience and I don't mind telling you that it is one of the things I prefer to experience alone. I feel slightly manic-depressive at museums swinging wildly from intense pleasure and awe to an exhibit that makes me quite angry. The artists are doing their job.
