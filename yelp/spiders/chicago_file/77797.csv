Little Goat Diner////Suggestions from what I saw: the Fat Elvis looked awesome if you're sharing with two other people.  The cinnamon rolls were ooey, gooey and looked amazing.  The shakes came in the old school diner glasses and one was even dairy free!  Next time I visit I'll have to try a burger and order a shake!  The side of fries are HUGE, so be sure to order with the intention of sharing.
