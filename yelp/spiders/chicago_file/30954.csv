Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After what seemed like eternity, our pizza came out. We got a 2 person serving Lou pizza - sausage, tomatoes and cheese. They cut it for you, because it is a little hard to manage. The crust was really amazing! Crispy like a pie crust and the toppings were abundant. This was the best part of the meal. Service was fine and they were diligent about filling up our waters.
