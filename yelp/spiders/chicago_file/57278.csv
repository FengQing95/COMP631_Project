Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////SPICY POTATOES WITH TOMATO ALIOLI - Very Good! These potatoes and Alioli had a great taste. The potatoes were just typical cut up chunks of potatoes and slightly seasoned with a little spices. The Alioli is what makes this dish. It is very good and adds the perfect flavors. An overall good dish!
