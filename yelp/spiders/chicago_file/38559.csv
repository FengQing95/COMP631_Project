Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Negative: Reservations are hard to come by, so we've always booked our visits well in advance. We've noticed Bavette's has changed their booking policy so reservations can only be made 30 days in advance (specifically on Resy.) Unfortunately, no matter how often we check in there is never availability. This has been frustrating when planning special events. We would love to see this changed!!
