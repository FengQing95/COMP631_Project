Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////You know, I don't really like deep dish "pizza", but of the places to eat it, this place is very good. Giordano's makes stuffed-crust pizza, whereas Lou Manalti's makes a cheese pie using dough and sauce as crust. It's fine. The wait is really long, but the service is generally fun and somewhat friendly. The food other than the pizza is what you'd expect - requisite bar food of mediocre quality that you need so it's not just "pizza" on the menu.
