Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My wife and I met a friend for dinner.  The reservation was under our friend's name.  My wife and I arrived at 5:30 for a 6:00 reservation.  The gatekeeper could not find the reservation.  Our friend came shortly after and straightened out the mix up.  At 6:00, we asked to be seated and the gatekeeper said that our reservation was at 6:30 and could not possibly be seated earlier.  We went back to the bar.  At 6:30, I asked the bartender if we could sit at a table that had been vacant the entire time.  He checked with the gatekeeper and we finally seated at the table that had been vacant.
