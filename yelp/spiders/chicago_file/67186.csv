Little Goat Diner////So far I've tasted the Goat Sloppy Joe, Los Drowned sandwich, Wing-style burger, mac and cheese, fried pickles, and blood orange meringue pie.  Mac and cheese was underwhelming but the Drowned and the Wing-style burger really stood out and made the meal.  I've had better fried pickles (ahem, Lillies Q) but the mustard they were served with and the onion rings made it a worthwhile choice.
