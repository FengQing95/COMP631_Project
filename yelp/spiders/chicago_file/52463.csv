Smoque BBQ////Sadly, Smoque was just another place in a long disappointing line that proves that Northside restaurateurs should just put away the sauce, turn off the smoker and travel a few miles to the South side to learn something about the food they are mocking with their below par efforts.  If they don't want to go to the South side, then maybe a weekend trip to Jim and Nicks in Birmingham, Dinosaur in New York, Gates in Kansas or the guy with the BBQ grill in the post office parking lot in Waterloo, Iowa may help out.  These ribs are all different, but they are all good.  Just please, I beg of you...go learn something so I can get good ribs close to home!!!
