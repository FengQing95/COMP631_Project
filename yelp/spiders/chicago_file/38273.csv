Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I really can't think of anything missing from my experience at Bavette's. Steak was perfectly cooked to the requested medium rare, ambiance was on point (enough lighting to see my food and enough darkness to really create a mood), service was comfortable & friendly, and it felt like we got good value for our money.
