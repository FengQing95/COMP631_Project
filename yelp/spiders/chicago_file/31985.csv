Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The deep dish pizzas take about 30-45min to create, so definitely come to Lou Malnati's if you have enough time for a longer lunch/dinner. Also, this place gets PACKED during peak hours. I recommend coming a bit earlier, even if you're not hungry, since you will have to wait for the pizza to cook anyway, and you can try to beat the lunch/dinner rush.
