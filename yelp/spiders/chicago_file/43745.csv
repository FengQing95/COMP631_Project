Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////6 of us went last night and we had a great time. We ordered a bunch of plates and pretty much shared them all. My favorites of the evening were the Grilled octopus and the bacon wrapped dates. Other than that, everything else was pretty standard fare. You can order sangria by the pitcher (the white is fab) as well as an assortment of spanish wines. It was definitely fun and lively on a Tuesday night.
