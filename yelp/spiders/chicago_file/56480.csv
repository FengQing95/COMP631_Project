Smoque BBQ////I had the Brisket platter and my wife had the Pulled pork sandwich.  The beans were good.  The Brisket was the star of the show, dead on with a tasty backend bark but tender moist interior.  I liked the Memphis bbq sauce.  Coleslaw was good as well.  Mac and Cheese was only fair in my opinion.
