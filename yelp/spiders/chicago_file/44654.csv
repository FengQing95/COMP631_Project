Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Having lived in Barcelona for six months, I know a thing or two about tapas. And this place, is hands down, one of my favorite places to go. Makes me feel like I'm sitting at my favorite tapas bar back in Barri Gotic. Green olives, Sangria, tomato bread, patatas bravas, they have it all! Fun atmosphere, good prices. I still have yet to try the paella, though! I sometimes forget where I am, and order in Spanish. woops
