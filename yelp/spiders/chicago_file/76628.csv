Little Goat Diner////I had very high expectations for Little Goat, being a Stephanie Izard restaurant. Unfortunately, it did not live up to the expectations. My boyfriend and I ordered the This Little Piggy Went to China and the Los Drowned. The Los Drowned was very good- not great. Nothing very memorable. This $14 sandwich came with no sides. The This Little Piggy Went to China was bad. This dish was very confused. There were too many flavors happening that did not complement each other. The Sichuan in the dish was overpowering and ruined the dish, leaving a numbing feeling on my tongue. The blackberries in the dish did not go with the other flavor combinations at all. Additionally, our service was terrible. One dish came out five minutes before the other dish, so my dish was a little cold by the time my boyfriend's came out. Also, I ordered a coffee and drank it in several minutes, but was never offered a refill, nor could I find our server to ask for a refill. For a $4 coffee, that's a little ridiculous.
