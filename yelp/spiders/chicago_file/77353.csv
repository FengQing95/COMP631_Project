Little Goat Diner////Bi bim bop breakfast bowl with cauliflower rice. This captures the flavor and essence of a favorite Korean dish with a base of cauliflower rice, pickled veggies, mushrooms, sprouts and two sunny Â side eggs on top. So yummy, so filling and yet light because of the cauliflower rice.
