Little Goat Diner////I ordered the Los Drowned sandwich with braised beef, havarti, avocado, pickled peppers and onions. I was expecting to love this sandwich because it had all my favorite things. However, the beef was dry and fatty. This was really disheartening because of what it could have been. I only finished less than half of the sandwich. I wish that the waiter had noticed that I had hardly touched my food and could have offered something else.
