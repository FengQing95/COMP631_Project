Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Buttercrust buttercrust buttercrust! Deep dish and thin crust are both absolutely amazing! Salads are gigantic, we get the side and it's enough for four of us. Delivery is cheap and super duper fast! I always order our pizza well cooked and uncut, it keeps the crispness through delivery that way! This is our neighborhood go to pizza spot!
