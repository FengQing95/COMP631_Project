Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////It was pricey, but it was worth it.  Solid tapas restaurant.   I have only been here once, but my fiancee and I loved our dinner.  Potato and Onion Omelette was great.  Garlic Potato Salad was great.  The Patatas Bravas are the best!  Also, the manchengo cheese (aged 2 years) is delicious.  Great mojito.  Fun atmosphere and helpful/honest waitstaff.  I will go back.
