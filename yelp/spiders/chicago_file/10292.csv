Art Institute of Chicago////Running until April 26, 2009, "Becoming Edvard Munch" focuses on the life of Munch, and the influences he drew upon in his work. Note: the fee of $10 is charged for this exhibit during Free February, but it's well worth it. Drawing from its collection, the Art Institute has built a series of rooms that each focus on a period or style of Edvard Munch. We see how Impressionism influenced his work, or his reaction to it in subject and style. No artist comes into the world fully realized, and I loved this exhibit's reach. I especially enjoyed seeing fellow Norwegian artists that were obvious influences once seen side by side with Munch, but largely unknown. The Audio Tour for this exhibit is $6, but I found it to be largely uninspiring. Reading the main statements in each of the rooms was plenty of information!
