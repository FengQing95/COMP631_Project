Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Beat the dinner lines arriving by 5:30p Saturday.  Smartly after taking name for table, they let you order your pizza to start baking.  15 minutes later we were seated, ordered salad and drinks.  30 minutes later after we enjoyed salad, pizza arrives!  Simply delicious pizza.  Staff were all smiles.  Excellent Chicago experience and must do when visiting.
