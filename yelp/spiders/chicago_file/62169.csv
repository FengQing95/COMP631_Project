Smoque BBQ////I've heard all the hype, so when I moved to the neighborhood I went on my first night. I went alone, got carryout and ordered the Brisket sandwich. I can't say I've had brisket before, but it was excellent. They apparently cook it for 15 hours, so it is fall-apart good, and the bbq flavor is awesome. The sauces were amazing, the Memphis in particlular was my favorite. Fries are good, cornbread good, however, a sandwich and 2 sides, you are looking at spending $14.
