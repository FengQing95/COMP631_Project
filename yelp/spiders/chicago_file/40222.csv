Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////So happy my husband and I had our anniversary dinner here! We were skeptical at first, but it met and exceeded our expectations. The dim lighting, soft music, and candle lit table made it feel extra special. We ordered the oysters, crab cake, two filet mignon (one bone in one without), Brussels sprouts, and sweet potato. Everything was OUT OF THIS WORLD! Pro tip- order the roasted garlic with your steak!
