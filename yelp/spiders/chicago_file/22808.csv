Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I came here because one of my friend talked to me about this place. When we arrived, waiters were waiting and talking and looked bored. They didn't pay attention to us and there was a horrible odor in the restaurant. They put dirty socker shoes on the wall (you can see the dirty grass and mud on it!). At this time I wanted to leave but we stay because we thought that maybe the food worths it. The waitress was very unhappy and fed up. After 40 min our pizzas arrived. The vegetables inside the pizza were very good and pretty healthy and tasty, but the dought was too crispy and very hard to eat. I won't come back and I don't recommend to go to this place as there are so much places better than this one.
