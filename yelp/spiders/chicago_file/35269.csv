Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We started with drinks that were very good: the mint julep, fairly deconstructed with lots of layering and mint and the horses neck which was smokey with bourbon and bright was ginger beer. Our appetizer was the OMG bone marrow, served with thick cuts of sourdough bread, onion relish and sprinkled with steak salt. It was just heavenly!! You can also order marrow to go along with your entree as well.
