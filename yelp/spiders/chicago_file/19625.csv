Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We got the Chicago Classic, which had a layer of sausage embedded in the pie. It was delicious and was probably the BEST pizza I've ever had. The waiter slices each piece onto your plate. Just sprinkle some parmesan and red pepper flakes on your perfectly made pie and you're good to go.
