The Purple Pig////- I'm personally not a fan of olives (sorry! been told I'm weird for this. Just doesn't suite my palate) HOWEVER don't fret! According to my counterparts it was really good but also really really salty. The olive itself is salty not because of the chorizo. Nonetheless the plate was devoured.
