Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Long overdue, but holy cow was this was an amazing meal. I'm still thinking about it months later. Highly recommend for any special occasion. It took a little bit to be seated despite having a reservation, but once seated downstairs we couldn't be happier or more impressed. Waiter was definitely attentive and we finished with ice cream and a sparkler for my boyfriends birthday-- what a nice treat!
