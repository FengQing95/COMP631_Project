Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They have a great idea in that they let you pre-order your meal as you wait in line.  We were told it'll he a 35 minute wait on a Saturday night which was fairly accurate.  Once seated we they told us there was a backlog and it'll be another 25 minutes which was fine since it's still shorter than the normal wait time from ordering when seated.
