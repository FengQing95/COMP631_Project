Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place was less than mediocre. Very surprised by the high reviews. They don't seem to use good ingredients. We had a watermelon and cheese salad in which the watermelon was pasty and old and the cheese tasteless. We tried many dishes and I'd rate them as 1-3 on a scale of 5.
