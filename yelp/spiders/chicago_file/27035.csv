Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I had my first deep dish pizza here and I can say I was not at all disappointed. It was the beginning of my new love for deep dish pizza. It was quite the magical moment but I'll spare you the details of how it went down. The personal size pizza is perfect, I was skeptical of the size but it was just right. I am a huge crust fan so, I loved the pizza just that much more because of their thick and buttery crust. Great pizza and if I actually lived in Chicago I would find myself coming back often. Maybe it's better for my health that I live a couple thousand miles away.
