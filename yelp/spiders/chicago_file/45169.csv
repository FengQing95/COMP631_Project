Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great food options. Make sure to make a reservation! They can be very busy during the week, especially during the weekend. Some time the place can Beverly cold if by the windows but usually if you don't make a reservation they will plop you there. Really continue to hit this place often
