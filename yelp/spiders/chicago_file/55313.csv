Smoque BBQ////The brisket was dry as a bone, even after I dumped BBQ sauce on it, and the rub did not have much of a flavor. I have made better brisket at home.  I was shocked.  The mac and cheese had an excellent crust, although their choice of cheese blend was disappointing because it was rather bland.  The best part, by far, was the cole slaw, which is saying something because it was just cabbage, Italian Dressing, and red onions.
