Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We need something like this in Florida. Started with a great glass of Elijah Craig Bourbon on a "Kind Cube". They have some pretty sick sourdough bread, but the house made bacon on the "wedge" salad (really a whole head of lettuce) was unreal. This is a thick cut bacon but it's really slab, which was delicious. The bacon outshines the salad, but I'm ok with that. I next tried the Short Rib Stroganoff, which I wouldn't order if it wasn't made with Short-Rib. That was the game changer on this dish, along with house made pasta, which was pretty good itself. Great dinner, steaks looks awesome as well...
