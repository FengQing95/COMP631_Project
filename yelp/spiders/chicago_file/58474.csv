Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////On my most recent visit, I went for brunch for the first time, and it was fantastic! Seriously, brunch tapas is just  genius. We went with the jamón serrano eggs benedict (our favorite), sausage fried paella rice, the Cuban sandwich, shrimp & grits, and the chocolate waffle. Everything was absolutely delicious, and added to my love of this place even more! 15/10 recommend!
