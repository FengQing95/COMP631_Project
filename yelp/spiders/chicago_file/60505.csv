Smoque BBQ////My last three attempts to eat here have been thwarted.  Apparently business has been TOO good, as I have been greeted on the aformentioned three occasions by signs on the door saying 'sold out'.  How can a restaurant located in a major city in the Midwest be completely sold out of meat on a Thursday?  Is the owner not paying his bills?
