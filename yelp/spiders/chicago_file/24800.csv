Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I can appreciate deep dish, and I would say this is the best I've had. That said (bring on the hate messages) I would have a tough time discerning much of a difference between this pizza and my local Pizzeria Uno chain. The bottom was a bit less soggy, and the crust was a bit flakier, but that's it. It was not a drastic difference to either of our tastes.
