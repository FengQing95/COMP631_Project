Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place gross from quiet to crushed in a few minutes, but they can handle it. They have a check in process where you put your name on a wait list with your phone number and you get a text when the table is ready. Then you go and preorder your pizza with the cashier (don't pay yet) and sit down.
