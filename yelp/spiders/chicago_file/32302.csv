Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Taste: this is my favorite thing to report on because the pizza was memorable! The crust was thick and buttery. The fresh cheese (from neighboring Wisconsin) was spot on! Hot and gooey. The sausage and other toppings were layered on next. Then the incredible tomato sauce. Savory, slightly chunky, and married all of the ingredients together.
