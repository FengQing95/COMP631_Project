Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Amazing breakfast and so affordable! No wonder it's super packed from 830am till closing! You can reserve seats on the no wait app but has to be 4 persons and under. Over 4 people you'll have to reserve seats with the hostess. There's essentially no waiting lobby as there's just an entrance and then it's all tables so be prepared to wait outside or squish inside with a bunch of people. We waited 30 min to be seated on a Friday morning around 930. Food is around average $10.
