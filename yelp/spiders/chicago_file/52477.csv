Smoque BBQ////A few weeks ago, my fiance and I made our inaugural trips to both Detroit and Slows Bar-B-Q, returning home with glowing things to say about both.  I posted a review on Yelp talking about our really positive (and delicious) experience at Slows, and almost immediately received a note back from another Yelper, telling me that Slows was good, but Smoque was "10x better".  So, when I was in Chicago and my friend Keem suggested that we go to Smoque for lunch for delicious, delicious BBQ, I was suitably intrigued.  AND also hungry.
