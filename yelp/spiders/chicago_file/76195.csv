Little Goat Diner////I'd been here once before so my mom and I decided to meet here for a Monday night dinner. I got there before her and went to the host and said I had party of two. I was informed that it would be a thirty to forty-five minute wait for a booth, or I could sit right away at the communal table, which I chose. My mom and I were seated across from each other in the middle of the table. At one end, there was couple, they were an odd match, but definitely on their third or fourth date. Maybe even their last. At the other end, there was a dad with his son, who had to be eight or nine. Basically, I was forced to eavesdrop on these strangers since I was right smack in the middle of this long ass table, which felt strangely intimate once seated. The father and son really caught my attention though, I'd sat exactly where that kid was sitting. I noticed his dad has no ring on his left finger, but the kid had mentioned his mother. I think they were divorced and the kid was spending spring break with is dad. Maybe it was more time than he was use to. Maybe he spends most the year with his mother and only school breaks with his dad who lives in another state. Maybe he painted a picture of what the time with his dad would look like, he painted it out the feeling of longing for his father who he deeply missed, but once was brought upon, had no idea how to act. He sat there quietly while he dad tried to spark conversation.
