Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Whenever family comes over to visit me in Chicago this is the place I go to! The portions are so big! Pricing is not so bad either and if you around 11:30 you will be full until 4-6pm. Although the wait is pretty long, the Bean is right there! It's totally worth the wait and food comes out quick!
