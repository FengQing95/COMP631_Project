Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute really tries to be a welcoming museum. From its children area, to the miniature Thorn rooms that captivate all girls until they turn 12, to the sculpture gallery for the blind (where they can touch the pieces) you can tell they actually care about the public's interaction with the art.
