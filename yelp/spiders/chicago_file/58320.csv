Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our friends hosted a b'day party in the Granada Room and I was thoroughly impressed with the different courses of tapas brought in by the unflustered waiters....it was tightly packed for a crowd of 50 including kids but the service was top notch with the drinks and all! certainly see why we all keep coming back here!!
