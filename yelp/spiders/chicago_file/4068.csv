The Purple Pig////This little tapas style restaurant is pretty much always on a wait.  If you want in, come on a weekday around 9pm+ in my opinion.  Secondly, you should know that the majority of their tables are community style, so be prepared to have people staring at your food...as you should be doing to them.  While normally I'm not into community style tables, it works here due to the tapas atmosphere.  The servers do not rush you, and do not make you commit to a certain amount of food off the bat.  As a matter of fact, our server told us to only order a few and look around after eating some, and then order more.  We did that with the family next to us.  We kept comparing dishes and talking about what we liked, and disliked.
