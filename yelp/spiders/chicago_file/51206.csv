Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Recommendations: Sangria (the specials are often the best), Pintxos Platter (gives you a little taste of everything... definitely a good choice if you've never been), spicy potatoes with tomato aioli, goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, **beef tenderloin and blue cheese, grilled squid with olive oil and garlic.
