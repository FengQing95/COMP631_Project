Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have tried both the Lou and the Chicago Classic, and I would say that these offerings are for the most part really consistent. The pie is a bit shallow in comparison to other deep dish offerings in the city, but I think it allows the person to safely enjoy 2 slices without feeling like a blob afterwards. I like the sausage that they use on the pizza on the Chicago classic. It is not too oil or salty, and is works in good harmony with the bed of tomatoes that accompany it. The Lou is a good choice with people not too fond of sausage, and provides a nice mixture of mushrooms and spinach (both favorites of mine in deep dish). The crust (which is the main standout in differentiating the different pizzerias), is much lighter and crispier than other places. I'm not a fan of very doughy crusts so this maybe my bias in this regard.
