Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Absolutely love!  I like to try new places when I go out to eat, but this is just a great staple.  Brought my parents here when they visited and though they aren't as familiar with tapas, but they both loved it!  Lots of vegetarian options (which I am) and the service is always on point!  One of my favorite go-to restaurants in Chicago.
