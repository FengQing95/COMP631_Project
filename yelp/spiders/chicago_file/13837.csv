Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When I got there the waiting area was pretty full, but I was able to get a seat at the bar immediately.  The food was delicious (salad, Malnati Chicago Classic, cookie desert and 312 beer).  The food came out relatively quickly considering there was a standing wait my entire visit.
