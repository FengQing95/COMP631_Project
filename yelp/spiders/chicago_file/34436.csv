Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Drinks: I started with the Old Fashioned Cognac. Definitely a strange choice for a girl like myself, but the waitress recommended it. I have NEVER been so pleased with a drink choice in my life. I also never order two of the same drinks at a restaurant, as I like to try something new. However, this drink was an exception to my rule! I got two, and the orange flavor mixed with the house-made maraschino cherries was to-die-for. I imagined this drink would be very strong and bitter, but it had a pleasant sweetness to it (while still being very nice and strong) and a little bit of a cinnamon spice flavor.
