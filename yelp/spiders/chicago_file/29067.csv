Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I heard from my friends that this was the MUST-TRY Chicago deep dish pizza joint, and it didn't disappoint! Lou Malnati's is a 10-20 min walk from the Bean and Willis Tower (the Skydeck), and I definitely recommend walking or coming here through a rideshare service because Chicago traffic can get crazy.
