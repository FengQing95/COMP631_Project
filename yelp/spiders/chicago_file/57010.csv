Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our waitress was very attentive and answered our questions about the menu well. My friend and I both didn't order any cocktails, since we both were more in need of caffeine, but I hear their sangria is amazing.  To eat I ordered the citrus french toast  stick, deviled egg, and baked eggs.
