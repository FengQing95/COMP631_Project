Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Very busy spot in the perfect location. The wait is ridiculous so I would advise to check in and get on the waiting list here on yelp. Super convenient! I got the cornbeef hash skillet with egg whites. It was a huge portion which I was only able to eat less than half of the order. The hash was good but not what I expected it to be. Kinda sad and disappointed. The hubby got the southern Benedict which he said was very good and finished it all. We also got an order of signature berry bliss pancakes which I would say was the best thing. I'm not very much of pancake person but these were yummy and moist and has such flavor. The ricotta in the pancakes was the perfect touch. Our friends got the special pumpkin spice and she said it was Delish and her hubby got the cinnamon roll pancake which he did say was the best and had the perfect amount of cinnamon. I'm glad I tried wildberry but not sure I would go out of my way to go back when in town.
