The Purple Pig////Chicago hardly fails when it comes to good food. This is a nice upscale restaurant, friendly front desk staff and server. The ladies seated beside me were having the Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes and Tzatziki and raved about it so I ordered it. My only critique is that the top was over salted, tapped the skewer on the plate a few times and it was ok.
