Art Institute of Chicago////A complete disappointment next to the world-class Millennium Park, which is literally my favorite piece of earth on the globe.  You can't bring something new into this city that is less than world-class becasue we are second to none.  That said, we already knew the Art Institute had a great modern art collection and that most of it was never on display because of space limitations.  I have been dying to experience the Modern Wing and was happy to pay and support such a beloved cultural institution as The Art Institute, so I went the first non-free day.  First of all, the exterior is particularly dull and more suited to a non-urban area.  The exterior reminded me of MvDR meets Frank Lloyd Wright's prarie style.  The interior, well it's Helmut Jahn's Terminal 1 at O'Hare.  Renzo Piano is a Pritzker-prize-winning architect and one of the "hottest" talents in the world.  You wouldn't know that from the Modern Wing.  And his bridge was even more lackluster.  If you want to see the most beautiful modern art building in the world -- it's the Tate Modern in London. If you want to experience the best modern art collection in the world -- it's MoMA in Manhattan.  The best new museum in decades and a totally unexpected surprise is Gehry's AGO in Toronto.  I was hoping for the best of all of these in the Modern Wing and what I got was a big plate of boredom.  That said, it's certainly fantastic to have more room for the collection to get displayed.  And the Cy Twombly exhibit was a highpoint.
