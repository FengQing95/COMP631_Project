Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visiting Chicago for the first time, a lot of people recommended this place for Chicago deep dish. So I figure I should give this place a Â try. So I ordered the The Malnati Chicago Classic which was really good!! The only thing is deep dish are very cheesy, so you must be a big fan of cheese to eat these pizza. The best part of this deep dish pizza I have to say is the crust. It was the best crust I ever had!!! It was crunchy and buttery lets say i couldn't stop eating the crust!!!
