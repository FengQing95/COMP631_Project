Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The sourdough bread was excellent, still warm and steaming when we tore it apart - top tier pre-appetizer stuff. The steaks were great as always. Both ribeye cuts are terrific and you can't go wrong with either. If you've tasted good truffle mac and cheese, you know what the mac and cheese here tastes like. It was great and I would get it again. Lastly, that lemon meringue pie - damn. Lemon meringue pie is always a letdown for me because my mother made a great one. After my taste of the chocolate cream pie, I gave the lemon meringue a shot. It was the best I've ever had, and the first that tops my old homemade one.
