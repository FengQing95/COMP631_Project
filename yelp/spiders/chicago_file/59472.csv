Smoque BBQ////I love this little hole in the wall restaurant!  They are very busy and the atmosphere is lively!  My brother and I got their pulled pulled combination sandwich with corn bread and Mac and cheese.  The pork tasted amazing and they come with bbq sauce on the side to add more.  They mac and cheese was baked in a small individual size container but I felt it was sufficient and tasty.  The corn bread was fresh and made with real corn.  There is indoor and outdoor seating and limited parking in the back.  Definitely a place to visit when I come into town!
