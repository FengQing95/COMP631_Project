Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I got the 10 oz filet mignon (which was absolutely INCREDIBLE) and we got roasted tomatoes and creamed spinach to share. I would definitely recommend the creamed spinach but the roasted tomatoes I could have done without. Overall, we probably got way too much food....but it was all incredible. I was trying to decide if I was going to get the 6 oz petit filet or the 10 oz that I ended up with. With an appetizer as large as the wedge, I wish I would have gone for the 6 oz filet.
