The Purple Pig////Let me start by saying the food is really good. The service at least due to our server, Heriberto, was abhorrent. Rude doesn't begin to describe him. He rushed us through ordering drinks and appetizers. Then we didn't see him for a long time to order our dinner. Once again rushed us through ordering. For example, as he went to each person to get their order, dare we pause for a thought because good ol' Heriberto didn't skip a breath to ask, " Do you need me to come back?" He asked every single one of us this.
