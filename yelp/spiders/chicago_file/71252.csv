Little Goat Diner////You can literally order anything on the menu, but that being said, I'd go with the Fat Elvis Waffle if it's your first time. The goat chili cheese fries are outstanding as well. Cocktails, coffee, deserts, milkshakes, seriously you can just blind-fire on this menu and walk away amazed.
