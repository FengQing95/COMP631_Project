Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My boyfriends family threw a party here and had all of us seated in a big round table which was nice to have. We were able to share all the tapas around and talk to each other face to face. We had some sangria and some wine as well. Both were great. We had tried almost everything and I don't remember anything I didn't like. We had paella as well which is something you have to try if you come to this place. One of the best dining experiences I've ever had.
