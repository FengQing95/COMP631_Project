Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I think that this place perhaps might cater to the shell fish lovers of the city?  The oysters and such around me were presented gorgeously.  But alas, the allergies of shell fish....  Also, there was an air vent directly above us that cause our not piping hot food to be cold quite quickly.
