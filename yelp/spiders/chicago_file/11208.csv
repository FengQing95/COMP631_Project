Art Institute of Chicago////I would recommend buying a CityPass and gaining faster access that way. The general admission line was ridiculously long when I arrived! I got to skip all of that AND had a guided audio tour included - I didn't think I would enjoy it as much as I did, but it was fantastic and so educational.
