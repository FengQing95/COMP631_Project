Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Cute atmosphere, nice staff, but really dark lighting. The bone marrow was really tasty - I could have gone with another plate or two (or three), the aged ribeye my boyfriend got was good, the pork I ordered was good and the sides were typical sides. I wasn't too impressed with their seafood menu even though our server recommended it was the best of the best, but you can't beat seafood from the PNW. Drinks were well concocted and nice and strong! Was it the best steak I've had in my life? No. Would I come back in my next visit to Chicago? Probably not.
