Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Really just an awesome place to either go romantic mode or have a memorable celebration at. Also, there's like a psuedo-secret lower floor which has fancier booths and a different ambiance (more classy, quieter) but the normal floor's liveliness has its own charm. I think you can choose which you want provided there's availability - just wanted to let you know!
