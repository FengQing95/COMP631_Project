Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cool place.  Went there for a double and ended up getting there a little early than our friends.  The wait was about an hour so we went to the bar to have a few.  Within 5 minutes of arriving and receiving our drinks a waiter came up to us and asked if we wanted a table.  Who's going to turn that down.  We got to skip the hour wait for some real good food.
