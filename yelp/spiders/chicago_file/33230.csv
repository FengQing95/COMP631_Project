Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've come here for both food and drinks and have yet to be disappointed.  The food is very high quality and the menu is pretty diverse.  The service was great at both the bar as well as sitting down at a table. The bartenders really know their drinks and you can tell they take pride in their craft.  I love the atmosphere - it is dark and sleek but also has a lot of room - both upstairs and downstairs.
