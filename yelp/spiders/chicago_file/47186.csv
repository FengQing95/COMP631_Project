Smoque BBQ////My gf and i werein Chicago for 3 days this week and Smoque's was a major high light. I had the brisket which was good. She had the ribs which tasted unlike any i had ever had before. You get to taste the meat and how it was cooked with hard wood. It was real BBQ and the best we either had. She wanted to come back the next night but we decided not to. The ribs weren't the whole story i personally loved the brisket chilli the corn bread and would love to have the recipe for the coleslaw. My gf could not stop raving about the mac and cheese. Said it was the best has ever tasted from a restaurant or anyone else. The reason i don't give 5 stars is portion size. They could have been bigger esp the sides. But great BBQ and we will be back and tell everyone to go there.
