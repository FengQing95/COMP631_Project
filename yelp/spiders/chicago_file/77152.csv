Little Goat Diner////Super loud. Like my party and I had to yell in order to hear each other. Really the thing I hated most about our experience. I ordered the BI BIM BOP BREAKFAST BOWL. Really good and huge portion size. Others liked the Reuben and the DARK CHOCOLATE CHIP CRUNCH PANCAKES (the granola was a great touch). I'd go back but only if we were sitting outside next time.
