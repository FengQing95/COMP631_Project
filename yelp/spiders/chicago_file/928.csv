Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////1) The Wait: couldn't complain since they have these BWW disks that buzz when your seat is ready. That leads me to think that they use a pretty good seating system. There is a spacious space outside the restaurant where you can hang before you are seated. Also pretty convenient since hopefully nobody will hear my stomach growling, compared to being indoor.
