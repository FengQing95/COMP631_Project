Art Institute of Chicago////Impressive and five star worthy even before they opened the Modern Wing last May, the Art Institute could easily keep anyone entertained for a day.  It's the second largest art museum in the country, behind NYC's Metropolitan Museum of Art, so plan accordingly.  There's truly something for everyone who appreciates any type of art from any period of time and any part of the world.  It even offers a breathtaking view of Millennium Park, where you can find even more art.
