Little Goat Diner////The theme-park experience continued because our waiter looked like a male fashion model who stepped out of a ski catalog. He was friendly enough, but I admit that I couldn't hear anything he said because the music and crowd chatter are SO LOUD in there. My wife and I took to using gestures and charades to communicate before finally just giving up and staring at our phones.
