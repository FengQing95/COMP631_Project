Art Institute of Chicago////Recently my husband and I visited this museum on a school excursion with my painting class. It was very interesting. The nice part was that it was donation admission which is helpful for us college students. There was an amazingly large range of artwork from all kind of artists both old and new. I was amazed at the size the facility and the quality of exhibits.
