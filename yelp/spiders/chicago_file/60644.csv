Smoque BBQ////One thing that may keep me away from Smoque is the hype.  I could almost smell Guy Fieri's hair gel as I crossed the threshold.  And as we all know, with hype comes congestion.  And I get really cranky when I'm forced to wait for food, a bi-product of my self-diagnosed, social-anxiety disorder.
