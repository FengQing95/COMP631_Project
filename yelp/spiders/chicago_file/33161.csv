Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////What I appreciate most is that it's immediately clear this is a place for grown-ups; everything felt deliberate and thought-out. Sure, they're trying hard with the whole "Edgar Allen Poe meets Alfred Hitchcock via the Matrix" decor, but I have to admit it pays off. And any place that has the brass to spin 50's bebop upstairs and Portishead downstairs knows what it's trying to accomplish.
