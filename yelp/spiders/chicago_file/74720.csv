Little Goat Diner////I'm a Top Chef fan so I was really excited to try this place. When walking in, the place is comfortable and you are warmly greeted. My server was awesome, he was a sweetie! I had the Kim chi asian breakfast thingy because I wanted something different. What a savory and sweet delight!  The flavors are creative and the textures keep things interesting.  The cappuccino was delicious and my server brought me a yummy complimentary scone as his gift. Love it!  Great environment and food.
