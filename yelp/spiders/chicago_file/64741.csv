Smoque BBQ////Sauces?  not my favorite, too sweet for my taste, I prefer more vinegar.  We asked about the different sauces they had and someone in the kitchen mentioned they use Coca Cola.  I could actually taste it in the sauce.  May contribute to why the sauce is on the sweeter side.  Either way, the BBQ here is one of the best in Chicago, these guys know BBQ.  It's worth the trip.
