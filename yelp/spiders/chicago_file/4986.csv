The Purple Pig////We started with the octopus. It was tender with a good chew. And I adored the salsa verde. The whole dish was a touch salty though. The pig ears were my fav. Crispy and chewy. The fried egg, kale, and peppers went well with the dish. The ribeye was a special they were offering. Meat sounded good, so we decided to get it. This dish was salty as well, but the ribeye was cooked to a nice medium rare. I'm more of a rare girl, so this was too cooked for me. I think they pre-cook the steaks as our server said they couldn't do rare.
