Little Goat Diner////And a HUGE shout out to the servers that stopped by to talk to my son. You all totally made him feel like a rock star, giving him high fives, talking to him about Green Lantern (yes, he brought the action figure to breakfast with us), asking him how he was doing. Â He was impressed with Little Goat so much he brought the Little Goat kiddie cup to preschool the next day and just kind of showed it off telling his little friends that he went to a restaurant with a "goat on the roof".
