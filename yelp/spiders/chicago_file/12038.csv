Art Institute of Chicago////Pro Tip: Buy your tickets online or on your phone before arriving. When we arrived, there was a line to buy tickets, but no line if you already had tickets. Just stroll right in to the ticket scanning booth. I brought our tickets on my phone the night before and mobile tickets were super easy to access and use. Just click the ticket and let them scan it.
