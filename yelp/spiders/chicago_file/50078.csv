Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////And the service....the epitome of an American experience. Rushing you out of the restaurant. Literally every 7-10 minutes was, "Is everything alright?" and when we weren't even done she was pushing the dessert, we were taking our time talking, kept coming back, like 3-4 times to ask if we were ready. I almost asked her if she wanted us to leave. It's like, please let us enjoy our company with each other and talk after a long day, I'll call you when I'm ready, please go away! *sigh*...so it goes...but I won't be going back. Tapas in the USA is a gimmick!
