Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Was here last evening for a late Mother's Day dinner I was very looking forward to. I had made the reservations 6 weeks ago while still in Florida. I did get a reminder call and was assured that the  "downstairs" room I had requested (not open on Sunday's) was on the reservation. WELL... We were taken in on time and seated but it ends up we were in the main dining room. The tables for two are close together but not quite as close as other Chicago steakhouses where you can really pick up your dinning mates conversation. Not until we had ordered and I had taken a trip to the ladies room was it that I realized where this "downstairs" was. Alert: while waiting for the ladies room...as there is only one...did I notice the stairwell in the back of the restaurant leading the the much more quiet and relaxed downstairs. AND where were all these five star servers??? Ours was good but not as the other described five star ones...had to look for him to order second drinks, ask for water to be refreshed...the béarnaise sauce did not go home with the steak leftovers. We did ask for a fresh one since at this place the béarnaise sauce is NOT uncharged...got a fresh butter instead! ...I'll give him a plus for refolding the napkin when I left the table.
