Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Finally, I can't finish this review without noting that their strong suit is cocktails.  This is a place you come to for a good standard martini, a nice glass of fine bourbon, or a well made sazerac.  I think every bar should be measured by their ability to make a proper sazerac because it takes real talent, attention to detail, and care.  It truly is a hand-crafted cocktail when prepared properly.  These mixologists know how to muddle it just right so all the flavors blend and become one. The proper straining is also important, no one wants bits at the bottom of their glass.  Finally, good ingredients are of course important, and use of a proper glass should never be compromised by an ignorant or lazy bartender, or an iconoclastic management. And of course, NO ICE!
