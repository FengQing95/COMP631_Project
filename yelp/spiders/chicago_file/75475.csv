Little Goat Diner////The food here is great. I had breakfast on a busy Sunday when in town and had the chicken and waffles. Also had mimosas (which were really small and expensive, meh) but overall the food was inventive and delicious. It's like an American diner with Asian,Mexican and comfort food influences. I am only giving four stars because the service was not all that great. The people who worked here weren't very nice and took forever to do things unfortunately. I would definitely go again though
