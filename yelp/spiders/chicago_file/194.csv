Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Everything was excellent! Wonderful, generous size meals at reasonable prices.  We couldn't decide between so many appealing choices so we shared the spicy Los Altos Eggs Benedict, Bacon Chicken Walnut Berry Spinach Salad, & Wholewheat Berry Crepes.  An iced chai tea and iced black currant iced tea. All were exceptional! We would probably order all this again, it was so delish! The patio was very nice too. My new favorite lunch/breakfast!
