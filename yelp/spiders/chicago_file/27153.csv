Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I came here on a Friday evening around 5 pm with one other person. We were told it would be a 25 minute wait, but we were seated about 5 minutes later. We had the option to preorder our pizzas before we were seated, since they take about 30 minutes to make. The personal size was sufficient for each of us. I got the Malnati Chicago Classic; the buttercrust was really good. The cheese and meat slid right off the crust when I cut into it, which made it kind of messy, but it was still very tasty. The service was good although we had to wait a little at first because it was already quite busy. Our server was very nice. When we left around 6 the place was unsurprisingly packed.
