Smoque BBQ////Brisket- To. Die. For. Perfection. I've only had it in sliced form and I've been told this is the far superior style. It's smoky and saucy but not too saucy (but just saucy enough if you know what I mean). It reheats well, so dont hesitate to get some to go. Maybe a pound of two. Eat it for breakfast. Seriously.
