Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Ambience. This place has it. 1920s. Dim lighting, gorgeous chandeliers paired with black pin tucked booths along the wall. Mixed wooden tables and walls. Perfect for gentlemen and ladies to explore great French cuisine. If you love Old Fashions and hand crafted cocktails visit the bar and watch their bartenders prepare with finesse.
