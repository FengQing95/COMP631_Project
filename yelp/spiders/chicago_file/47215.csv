Smoque BBQ////so let's get to the ribs. was it actually good and did it represent the hype? well, it was one of the better ribs i've had and i could tell you that they've put some work marinating the ribs. i actually preferred them without the dipping sauce. this should tell you how much taste the rib it self has.
