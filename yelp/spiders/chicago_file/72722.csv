Little Goat Diner////It lived up to the hype. Didn't realize Girl & the Goat was closed on Sunday mornings, so we went across the street to Little Goat Diner and were lucky enough to be able to sit almost immediately at the bar. I got the "parathas burrito" and my friend got the "this little piggy went to China". Both were literally amazing. I was surprised by the look of the parathas burrito (for obvious reasons, was expecting a burrito) but it was perfect and not too heavy either. Would highly recommend!! We also started off our meal with a nice crab dip appetizer that was truly aces.
