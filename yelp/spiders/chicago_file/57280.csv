Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////SPINACH & MANCHEGO-STUFFED MUSHROOMS - Meh! Honestly this dish was not anything special. It was mushrooms with sauce, spinach, a little cheese on top and bread crumbs. The flavors/ingredients didn't really go together or flow. It honestly just tasted like mushrooms and cream sauce. Nothing special and my husband who loves mushrooms wasn't even crazy about them. It honestly just lacked in flavor.
