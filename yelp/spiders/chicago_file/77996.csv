Little Goat Diner////Great food, great vibe, super relaxed and casual. We enjoyed some of their unique takes on traditional dishes... like their scallion pancake. My husband absolutely loved that dish so much, and will come back just to eat it. The machos nachos were basically hardcore and so super crunchy and delicious, and the fatoush salad was flavorful and filling.
