Smoque BBQ////I know that I'm not an expert on BBQ, but I think I know a good rack of ribs when I taste one.  I ordered the baby back ribs, the beans, fries, and a side of the pulled pork.  The ribs were slightly overdone on one side, and were not easy to pull apart...I don't know if this is supposed to be good or bad.  However when I bit into a few of the overdone side ribs, the meat was tough, chewy, and had a chalky taste.  I'm going to give this place another try, but mark one down for the ribs.
