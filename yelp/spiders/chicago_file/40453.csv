Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Absolutely delicious food. Probably my favorite steakhouse in the city from a steak standpoint. I ordered the petite filet, which had a delicious sear on it, paired with a roasted tomato and creamy sauce. Most places charge anywhere from $5-10 for a sauce to accompany your steak -- I appreciate the fact they included this with their petite cut. The bacon and tomato salad was a delicious start to our meal (the half-portion is best for 2 people). The sides were great also (their mac & cheese beat out Maple & Ash and RPM Steak). I definitely plan on coming back.
