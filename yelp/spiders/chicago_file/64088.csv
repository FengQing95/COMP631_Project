Smoque BBQ////Not only is this the best BBQ but it also has completely on point sides. Smoque is cool because you stand in line and place your order, eliminating the tipping aspect, which is pretty cool. The individuals that seat you and clear tables are on point, even when the place is FULL UP, they always manage to move tables around and keep it flowing to the point that as soon as you get your food, you've been sitting for at least a few minutes. Can't beat the fact that it is also a BYOB. Also, in the summer, the outdoor seating is a great option to have. Typically when we go here we order the gumbo.. which is a gorgeous little piece of heaven. They have the white rice on the bottom and it's not overly fatty and just very well done with a little bit of spice that hits just right. Also, we tend to get the St. Louis Ribs... so meaty, so well done, the rub is so delicious I sometimes don't even need some sauce (Carolina is my preferred). We also grab some brisket (if you order it chopped, you won't be sorry). Additionally, their mac and cheese is just simply divine. They do bake it so it has a nice little crust on top with breadcrumbs. I also truly enjoy their coleslaw, it's not creamy I think they use some sort of vinegar or something instead, which I enjoy. Alsoooo... their fries are awesome. Been here a lot, have picked it up a lot, will continue to eat it... a lot.
