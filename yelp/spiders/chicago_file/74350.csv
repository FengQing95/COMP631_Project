Little Goat Diner////This place did not disappoint. I shared a Los Drowned and the Tonkatsu. They were both good but the Los Drowned was my favorite by far. The beef on it is crazy tender and the break is so soft the sandwich pretty much melts in your mouth. We got the corn side, which was delicious, and the pork belly home fries. I'd recommend both!
