The Purple Pig////My party of 6 got sat down 15 minutes after we signed in, and we were seated at the high top communal style table. It was pretty crammed, but not going to complain since we barely had to wait. The waitress was very nice and talked us through the menu, WHICH CHANGES TWICE DAILY (according to her anyway)!! So don't be surprised if you see something on Yelp that you want to try, but isn't on the menu :3
