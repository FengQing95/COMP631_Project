Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have always loved this place ever since I was introduced by my cousin who worked there.  Best tapas in town and the passion fruit sangria is amazing.  I have been to several others tapas restaurants, and though they may have their strong points, I have turned many people in to BA-BA fans!
