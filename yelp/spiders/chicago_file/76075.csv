Little Goat Diner////To be special , we order appetizers onion rings and fried pickles tempura stile and crab dip , the onion rings and pickle was really greasy, the crab was more like a soup, had no textured at all, for main course my husband order the chicken pot pie and I order the cheesy grits and the fried chicken, his pot pie was delicious, my grits were cold and salty, the chicken was undercook, I informed the waitress about the under cook chicken and she informed me that it wasn't under cooked and that it was the brine the chef used to marinate the chicken on, so I showed her the bloody inside of my chicken and told her that it had nothing to do with the brine.
