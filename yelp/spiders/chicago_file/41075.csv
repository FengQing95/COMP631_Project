Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I am obsessed!! This is by far the best place to go with a group of friends.  Their food is amazing and it is always fun to pick a few different things here.  I love their fillets with blue cheese and their scallops are to die for!  Though their food is incredible, nothing beats a pitcher of their sangria.  My favorite has to be the passion fruit, it is perfect for these hot summer days... or at least the few warm days we have gotten.  As embarrassing as it is, I went there 3 times last week with friends because I couldn't get enough.  Definitely a highlight of Lincoln Park!
