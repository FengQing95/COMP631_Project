Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////DISCLAIMER: So, I'll caution you on several fronts: (1) I waited months to permit my bias to subside in order to let the rating rise to a legitimate 4 or better because of the Hipster problem; (2) I managed to evaluate the food and other criteria legitimately and immediately, saving the rant on hipsters as the finale; (3) I'm playing catch-up on my Yelp reviews because, frankly, I do work for living; and (4) do not read this if you are a hipster, as this one may legitimately cause you to cry about the failure that is your life. Â So food first; then hipster rant.
