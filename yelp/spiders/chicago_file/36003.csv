Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I can't believe I haven't reviewed Bavette's yet! I have been here over ten times since I first discovered it in November 2016. I love the ambiance, the food, and the service! The seafood is delicious and very fresh. The steak is buttery and well seasoned and the sides are all delicious. I also love their wine policy!
