Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////While deep dish pizza is not my favorite type if pizza it was great...we tried the Lou twice,  once deep dish, once thin crust...I preferred the thin crust but both were great.... the cheese cubes were a meal in themselves as was the combination plate  hor derves... my favorite though was the Lou's bruschetta! Delicious! Omg more more more...
