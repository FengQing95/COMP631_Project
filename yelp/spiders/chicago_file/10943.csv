Potter Palmer may not have agreed with her choices but he knew that she had impeccable taste and also a great eye for undiscovered upcoming painters. So Bertha bought what she liked - and Potter paid for it. Luckily, what she liked most were the then unknown painters of Paris like Monet (she bought 30 paintings from him), Renoir, Lautrec, Seurat (she bought his masterpiece "Sunday in the Park"), Manet, Gauguin, Mary Cassette (she bought more Cassette paintings than any other collector in the world), Degas, and of course Vincent Van Gogh.
