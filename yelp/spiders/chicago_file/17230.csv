Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was my first time having Chicago style pizza and it was great. That said, we had no idea how filling it would be and really over ordered. Between the salad we ordered as a starter and then the pizzas, it was just too much. We had a large salad and two large pizzas for 4 adults and 4 kids and took home a lot of it.
