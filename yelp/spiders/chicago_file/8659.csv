Art Institute of Chicago////I used to come here a bunch as a kid, but had not been back in about 12 years or so. It was great to return! It seems as though a lot has changed, but a lot has remained the same. The exhibits are fantastic, and they have so many pieces that you will recognize, even if you are not all that familiar with art.
