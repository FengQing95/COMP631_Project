Little Goat Diner////My wife had the bahn mi, and it was actually terrible. The worst bahn mi we've ever had, to the point of being inedible. It was like they had poured an entire bottle of fish sauce on it, and that was all you could taste, which as you may know, is very good in its proper dose, but basically tastes like rotten fish.
