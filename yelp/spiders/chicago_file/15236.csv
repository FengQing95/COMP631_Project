Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My Chicago visits are defined by lots and lots of pizza. My personal favourite remains to be the Malnati Chicago Classic. That out-of-this-world food butter crust was indescribably good, and combined with layers of cheese and sausage, deep dish could not possibly get any better. Based on food alone, Lou Malnati's would undoubtedly get 5 stars from me. However, I review on the whole deal. Unfortunately, the service seems to be lacking at this Lou Malnati's location. While my server was very informative in helping us choose our pizzas (you can order half & half flavours!), the waiting staff who brought the pizza out was not so great. He didn't let us snap a single photo of the pizza before cutting, and he kept cutting one less slice than we needed at the table. It was frustrating because he didn't look or listen. (My server knew what my table wanted, but there must have been miscommunication.) So, I'd suggesting reiterating your request to the waiter when he comes with the food. Also, the restaurant tends to get very busy, so I suggest dining early!
