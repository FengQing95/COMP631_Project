Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I ordered a beef empenada with a perfectly buttery, crisp pastry crust; the filling was a touch spicy, but pleasantly so. I also had the cjphicken and chorizo skewer. It was juicy, well-seasoned and garnished well. The presentation of all plates was artfully done and while small in size, perfect for sharing.
