Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////In one word: AMAZING! The wait can be killer - over one hour in our case - but it is SO worth it! Plan ahead and make sure you visit this place if you come to Chicago. I had the best crepe I ever had and probably will have in my life! Their skillets are really good too and there is plenty food, enough for too if you order a side along with it. The service was also impecable! Whenever we come to Chicago now, we're definitely having brunch there!
