Art Institute of Chicago////If you're into this place as much as I am, the memberships offer a lot of great stuff too. As a student, I was able to become a member for only $40, giving me free admission (and a free guest entry), 10% off the cafe and gift shop, access to the member lounge where coffee is totally free, first dibs on entry into new exhibits, a subscription to the institute magazine, and a free two-pocketed member tote bag that is my new man-bag of choice. I can't recommend enough a membership at the Institute.
