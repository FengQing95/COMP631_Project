Art Institute of Chicago////I enjoy art and I know that even though the internet is great - it does not do justice to the actual pieces of art themselves.  The internet is a great way to learn about reference and time and artist but not about the works themselves.  That is why it is so important to go in and LOOK and see and CONNECT with art that inspires/ shocks/ or moves you in general.  Please do tell me what your favorite piece in the world is- I'd love to know too.
