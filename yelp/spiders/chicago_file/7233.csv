Art Institute of Chicago////I was underwhelmed at the opening of Christopher Williams: The Production Line of Happiness. The exhibition divisions into multiple spaces, floors and buildings is very disruptive and unorganized. Â The exhibit cohesiveness and flow was destroyed unnecessarily while creating an extremely unfinished representation of the work. This curated exhibition lacked the finesse and attention to detail expected by the Art Institute of Chicago. The coolest thing in all... Is the Bright Yellow Exhibition Graphic pasted in the Main Hall.
