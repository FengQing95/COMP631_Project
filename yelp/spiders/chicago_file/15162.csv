Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Out of all the places I've tried, I really prefer Lou Malnati's crust.  It's crunchy, yet chewy.        When my party of six strolled in at 8 PM on a Thursday, we were quoted a wait of one hour.  The server took our phone number in order to reach us, then we decided to hit up Bull & Bear next door for a few drinks to kill the time.  BUT DON'T LEAVE YET!  If you're ordering a whole deep dish (which I recommend you do), then you should place your order now. The pizzas alone take +/-45 minutes (depends on how busy the place is), so it's best to put your deep dish order in while you are waiting to be seated.  If you're ordering other things (salad, pasta, or pretty much anything other than pizza) then you will order once you're seated.  Our plan worked out flawlessly at Bull & Bear because we got seated outside without waiting and could easily pay and leave from the patio.
