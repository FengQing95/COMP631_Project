Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Nancy, Nancy, Nancy.  That's all I can say about this place.  Our server did not allow our sangria glasses the opportunity of emptying and I loved that.  Nancy was extremely attentive to our needs and like I said was ridiculously on top of our alcohol consumption, she said she was a big fan of keeping everyone "watered down", guess what Nancy my girlfriend & I are too.  I highly recommend this place for any tapas lover, great food, great service (Nancy) and good times.
