Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I ordered the citrus cured salmon thinking it was one I had last time and they had no problem switching it for the one I thought it was. That grilled salmon & pesto is on point. One thing I adore about this place is the sauces, and my husband agrees. Fish was cooked to perfection.
