Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////At this point, I was expecting our pizza to come out pretty soon - after all, we had ordered in advance. However, this was not the case. After already waiting an hour, we then had to wait another hour to get our pizza. What's the point of pre-ordering then? I feel like they may have messed up our order, because I saw another table get their pizza relatively quickly after they sat down. Our server was very inattentive, and this just made the wait so much more annoying. He would serve the tables next to us and then just ignore us. He never checked up on us or gave us updates about how long the pizza would take.
