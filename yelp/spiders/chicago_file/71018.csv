Little Goat Diner////Hands down the best brunch I've had in Chicago, of course the company also matters and I was fortunate to go with amazing friends.  They have a unique way of re-doing staples and making them "to die for" interesting.  Usually a stock standard savory lover of eggs for breakfast, I lashed out with the french toast - I cannot explain the wonder of this food with the miso bread.  We bought a loaf and I happily begged to take it back to NY with me, citing you can buy it anytime to my local chi-town friend!  Amazing menu and worth the wait on the weekend!
