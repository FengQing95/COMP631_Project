Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place looks okay from the outside, but the inside is much nicer.  This is my favorite tapas place so far and it really is pretty reasonable.  My favorites are the bacon wrapped dates, meatballs, cheese with crusty bread....and hell...pretty much everything on the menu.  Great ambiance, good service good drinks and nice patio area.  If you're going to do tapas, do Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba.
