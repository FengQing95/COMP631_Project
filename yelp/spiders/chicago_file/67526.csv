Little Goat Diner////It was a perfect Tuesday afternoon in Chicago - fall temperatures and the sun was shining... little goat put the cherry on top of our perfect day.  Our server Sean was very knowledgeable and friendly - he guided us through our over eating exhibition perfectly.  The home made hot dog wrapped in pancake and egg was the perfect combination of savory and sweet - home made corned beef !!!!  nacho's - those chips were awesome.  this is a place i'll go back to - its classic and funky but so welcoming.
