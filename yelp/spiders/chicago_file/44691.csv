Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place has never disappointed. I've been here several times now and it's always delicious. Two of us ordered about 4 tapas and were stuffed. We had the grilled squid, spicy potatoes, kabob, and lamb. Awesome. Fresh bread is served right when you sit down and they always have a new flavor of sangria of the night. :)
