Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Although we were already full, we ordered the chocolate cream pie for dessert. It came with an old fashioned sparkler (we were celebrating an occasion). While I had intended just to have a taste, I ended up eating more than I should as the pie was better than I thought possible. Rich, smooth chocolate that didn't taste like chocolate pudding (I hate it when it tastes like pudding).
