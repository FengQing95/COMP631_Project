Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I recently returned to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba after being away from Chicago for 6 years. I forgot how much I loved the tapas here (despite thinking tapas are a little silly...), and I can never say anything bad about the sangria. They offer a great happy hour, and sitting at the bar area was a nice change. I will definitely be back any time I'm in the area, and recommend it to anyone who needs dinner plans.
