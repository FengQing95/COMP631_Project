Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////There are so many good ones, but one kind of secret one I like to get is the ham and chicken croquettes. They're crisp and cheesy gooey and come with TWO sauces. CBBR also has some classics. The patatas bravas are great, the tortilla espanola is an eggy delight, and you have to get some bacon-wrapped dates. They also have these chorizo-wrapped dates that are stuffed with I think manchego, and you can order them by the piece. See, they know what they're doing.
