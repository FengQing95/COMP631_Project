Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visited Lou Malnati's Pizzeria during a business trip to Chicago.  Went on a Friday night and the place was packed!  It took ~ 35 minutes to be seated for 3 people.  But, in order to speed up efficiency, they allow you to preorder your pizza so that it will be ready for you once you are seated in your table.  For the 3 of us, we ordered the "Lou" at a medium size since it said that it would be good for 4 people.  Once we sat down, it unfortunately took longer for the pizza to be brought out, and we ended up waiting for ~20 minutes for our pizza once we were seated.
