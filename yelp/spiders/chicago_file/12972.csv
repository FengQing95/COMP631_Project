Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////the best pizza I have ever in my life had. Soooo good, so thick, so cheesy, and sooo far away from California(and even more to ship to CA). Seriously, the pizza was amazing.  We got the sausage and I think I had 4 whole pieces to myself, thats how good it was.  I dream of being back in Chicago and having pizza here again and I cant wait to introduce my boyfriend to it.  We recently had pizza for the first time in NYC at Grimaldis while we were visiting and Grimaldis had NOTHING on Lou's! 5 stars for Lou's!
