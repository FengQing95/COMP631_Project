The Purple Pig////Finally I got the pork belly accompanied with a ginger carrot sauce. The sauce was amazing and the pork belly was fatty and flavorful without being chewy at all. The cherry on the sundae was my waiter, Hebert. He was extremely passionate and knowledgeable about everything on the menu and made my dining experience very pleasurable. In my opinion, this is one of the restaurants in the Chicago area.
