Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The only other time I had tried deep dish was at an UNOs years ago which was not good, so I figured I did not like deep dish pizza.  Lou Malnati's changed my mind.. didn't have high expectations but I was pleasantly surprised when I tried Lou Malnati's for the first time.  We ordered a personal classic deep dish to share (as a snack before our dinner reservation elsewhere hahah), which came in four slices and it was crispy and absolutely delicious.  I was raving about it to everyone when I returned home from my first Chicago visit.  However, in my most recent visit, we ordered a few of the large size pizzas which were not the same as the personal size.  This time the pizzas were a bit soggy and the crust was not crispy.  However, the salad was great.  I'll be back for a personal pizza next time with hopes that it will be as good as the first time I had it.
