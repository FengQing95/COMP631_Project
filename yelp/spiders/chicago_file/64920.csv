Smoque BBQ////I'm from KC. We easily have the best BBQ. But, Smoque was so good! No regrets! I had the 1/2 chicken and it was cooked to perfection. My fianc√© had the St. Louis ribs, which he gobbled up. He told me they had the best taste. My soon to be mother-in-law had the brisket and it was so perfectly cooked, it was falling apart when she picked it up.
