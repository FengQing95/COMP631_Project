Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Only downfall of the whole experience is that the women's bathroom is TINY. Two girls were waiting in line before I entered and there really was no room for 3 girls to stand. There's also only one sink, so it made it incredibly awkward as I tried to brush my teeth after dinner and even got a few oral hygiene jokes made at my expense.
