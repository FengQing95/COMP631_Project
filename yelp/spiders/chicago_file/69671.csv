Little Goat Diner////Our party consisted of four first-time customers.  We arrived on a Sunday morning around 10:15 a.m. and confronted a long waiting line of people jammed inside the front door.  We were told our wait time was approximately 35 - 40 minutes.  Although I usually don't wait in line for that length of time, I made an exception because the other folks in our party didn't want to tramp around in the cold winter weather looking for another place.  As it turned out, we were seated close to an hour later.
