Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's cooks that beef the best of any steakhouse in the USA. Hence, my favorite restaurant of all time. The Burrata cheese is done with impeccable technique, their cocktails are such american classics, the carrot cake is also amazing. The bacon is truly special, I have no idea where they source it from or how they cook it, but no one has anything like it. I have brought friends, family, and colleagues here on several occasions, its such an incredible dining experience. I live in Denver now, but I cannot wait to take my husband here when we come to Chicago for a wedding next month.
