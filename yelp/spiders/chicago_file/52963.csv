Smoque BBQ////I'm pretty sure that I am very lucky I live close to Smoque because I go here often. The food is absolutely delightful! The best brisket and ribs in Chicago that I have tried thus far! I would recommend this everyone! My 2 and 5 yr old love their food as well. After going in twice last week and at least a dozen other times I thought I might make a review! Great service and hospitality; even tho sometimes I don't know where to stand to wait for my carryout lol
