Art Institute of Chicago////What a great museum with a wonderful collection. Nice collection of impressionist work from Renoir, Monet, etc. Plenty of range here in the types of displays with antique french paper weights and Chinese statues right up to great American paintings. Plenty here to satisfy any art aficionado for a day if not more.
