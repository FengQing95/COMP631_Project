The Purple Pig////The worst part of it was the annoying table next to us with a vegan girl asking way too many questions about things being altered and then being shocked when the answer was no. The place is called the Purple Pig...do you seriously think this is the best place for you, vegan girl? Stupid. I will say, however, the waiter was awesome with her and very patient. The service here is excellent! They are really knowledgeable about what they are selling. Especially when pairing wines and dropping a lot of money while doing so.
