Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The waitstaff was prompt, the food did not take long to get, and the bus boys made sure Â your plates were taken away when you were done and you had new plates at your table. I am truly disappointed that I have not been here before hand, but will be visiting again in the near future!
