Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I had their breakfast skillet that was made to perfection. Lots of fresh (not overcooked) veggies mixed with hashbrowns and eggs laid gently on top (not mixed in) with fresh grain bread and home-made jam. I've become so particular with breakfast foods (a.k.a, I'm really picky) and they definitely nailed it. The second time I went, I had the fruit crepe. It went nicely with the early Chicago sunshine on their patio across from Millennium Park where the tulips were blooming.
