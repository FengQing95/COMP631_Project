Smoque BBQ////Has been our go to for BBQ in Chicago! We live in the northern suburbs and hadn't been for quite some time. We've tried other chain restaurants that claim they do BBQ, but Smoque is head and shoulders above them all. Worth the drive and the place still has great food and a great vibe. Keep it up.
