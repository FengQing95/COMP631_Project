Smoque BBQ////Some of the best pulled pork I've ever eaten, and the coleslaw is perfect. I wanted to mention the great service - We came in about 45 mins before closing. By the end of our meal, it was after 9pm (Sunday closing hour), and without thinking about that we went back to the counter to order some bread pudding. They initially told us the register was closed (which we understood, it was after closing), but as we sat finishing our beers, one of the folks from behind the counter came out and gave us two servings of bread pudding to go! Totally didn't have to do that, but it was very generous of them to do so. And the bread pudding was FANTASTIC! Will definitely be back when I travel to Chicago again.
