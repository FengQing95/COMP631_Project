Little Goat Diner////On the side, I had the pork belly home fries, which need to be in your life now.  They are served with (not enough) pickled peppers, cilantro, and a fish sauce vinaigrette.  I asked for the potatoes to be extra crispy and some were but not all.  The pork belly was cut into large cubes and was cooked perfectly.  We also were delivered an order of fries to our table mistakenly.  They were thin fries, and good.  Not the best I've had or anything, but a good and simple quality fry.
