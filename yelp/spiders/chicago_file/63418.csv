Smoque BBQ////Although the food here is delicious, they received poor marks due to their inconsistent delivery. I called a large in order an hour before and showed up when they told me to over the phone. Apparently the order had not been put in and I was just told "sorry" with a shrug. They made zero effort to expedite my order and left me with a sour taste for the place. Too bad.
