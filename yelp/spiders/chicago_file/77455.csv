Little Goat Diner////Get the goat chili cheese fries! Holy mother of god you will not be disappointed.  They're pretty much everything that is right in this world. The bahn mi burger jumped out at me and I decided to go with it.  Delicious! The textures and flavors and freshness. Everything was perfection.  My companion has the fish tostadas and she she kindly shared - wow! Very good.
