Little Goat Diner////Work with me here. The wallpaper is barely Indian. It's almost paisley, but not quite. It must have been inspired by the parathas burrito because they're twinkies. The breakfast burrito has a touch of Indian with the parathas flatbread, but then it's all these crazy things that only a genius would put together. Avocado and beans; okay. Chili sauce, makes sense. Some cheese; fun, sunny eggs. But then there are these vinaigrettey greens added in and you get all these nutso flavors mixing together for a sweet/sour/spicy/creamy party in each bite from start to finish. The burrito is like the wallpaper - pretty, delicate, and sorta Indian. It's quite eclectic. -- I can't wait to try the other vegetarian/pescetarian options!
