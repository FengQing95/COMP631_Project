Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Just amazing. First time in Chicago, first time trying the deep dish pizza and I couldn't have chosen a better place to do it. I wasn't sure I'd like deep dish because I'm not a big fan of gooey or overcrowded pizza, but this place gives you exactly what you want. You can order your pizza well done or gooey, or even ask them to go easy on some ingredients of you're not a fan of having pounds and pounds of cheese, or sauce or anything else for that matter. They do take a while, but it's well worth it. The garlic bread is superb, and the mozzarella sticks are just perfect. Service? Impeccable! This is a place where locals go, so, you can't go wrong.
