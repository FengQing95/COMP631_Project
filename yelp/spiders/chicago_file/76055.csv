Little Goat Diner////I just love love all the food here and have left so satisfied every time I've visited. I most recently had the "piggy" meal with Chinese sausage and Szechuan chili sauce on a cheddar chive biscuit. It was very good though a little heavy on the Szechuan sauce. We also had a malt milkshake and I could have drank the entire thing in one sip it was that good. And the barista special for the season is a sesame lemon sweet cream latte that I just can't get out of my mind. I'm docking one star for service which has been slow to nonexistent the past few times I've visited. But the food is amazing and I'm glad to brave the crowds and mediocre service to continue returning.
