Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Because I want to be "transported" you could say, I loved being at Cafe BBR. I loved the hustle and bustle, the warm dining rooms, being close to other people with their friends and family. It felt like what it might be like to be in Spain. Because, Lord knows, I have never been.
