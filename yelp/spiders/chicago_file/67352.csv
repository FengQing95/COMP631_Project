Little Goat Diner////I have debated on if I should write this review or not.  I am a big Stephanie Izard fan and a Girl and the Goat Fan.  I was so excited to see her open another restaurant in my neighborhood!  I have been to Little Goat Bread at least a half dozen times and love it.  Everything I have had has been outstanding.  Solid 4 stars there!  But the diner.... for right now, I cannot give it 4 stars but I am hoping it will earn a rewrite soon.
