Little Goat Diner////Finally got a chance to try Little Goat Diner after hearing great things about the restaurant! We went on a Thursday afternoon around 12:15. We had a reservation but still had to wait a little bit as it was super busy with the lunch crowd. I ordered the Dark Chocolate Chip Crunch Pancakes and they were so good! I ended up only being able to eat half of the plate and took home the other half. The guy next to us ordered the Bull Eye's French Toast and my friend and I agreed that we had to try it next time because we most definitely will be coming back!
