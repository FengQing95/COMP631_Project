Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Order a pitcher of Sangria. The traditional Red is a good option. We tried the White Peach this time and it was a little too sweet. Was more like juice than Sangria. The tapas here are affordable, but be aware that if you order Wine/Sangria, you're bill will reflect accordingly. Be Warned.
