Smoque BBQ////Let's get down to brass tacks.  I mean, after several visits, i've tried a large variety of things on the menu.  Brisket, links, pulled pork, ribs, and coleslaw.  I wouldn't dare say that any of these items are horrendous or poorly prepared.  Actually, the brisket is quite tasty, albeit incredulously rich.  The ribs and links were also pretty tasty.  Nonetheless, I really have failed to have my mind blown as many reviewers on yelp have.  Like I said, I would consider all of their smoked meats good, but nothing special.  As for the sides, I will say the mac is delicious.
