Little Goat Diner////I'm wondering why oh why I'm giving a diner 5 stars...but I can't help myself! In the past month I've been here twice for the worlds best patty melt (aka morning after food) and the Choco Taco Sundae (for two!!). There are so many awesome menu items, but I'm sticking to the tried and true at this point. It hasn't failed! In spite of crowds, the wait is minimal and all the seating is good. Lots of booth seating. The only exception to that is having to wait or sit in the annexed bar. It's a bit snug and not cozy enough to stay long.
