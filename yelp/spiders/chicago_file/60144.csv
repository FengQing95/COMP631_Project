Smoque BBQ////So, after having Fat Willy's and Calvin's, a friend recommended Smoque as a great BBQ spot that's still young enough to put the needed care into their food to produce a great meal. Â Smoque was definitely one of the better BBQ joints I've been to in a while and I'll be heading back, as long as they don't run out of food.
