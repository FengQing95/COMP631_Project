Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////What made the night so memorable was the fact that we sat right next to the most awkward first date. Ever. Some poor girl sat victim to terrible questions like, "What do you look for in a guy?" and "What's your take on creme brulee?" while the guy passionately presented his grocery lists of a) why he doesn't date and b) what he looks for in a woman. Yes, we eavesdropped. Yes, we might have taken a few pictures. And yes, we laughed when the guy had a tray of dirty plates dropped on his head. But we about lost it when he got a free dessert out of the deal and then high-fived his date. Classic!
