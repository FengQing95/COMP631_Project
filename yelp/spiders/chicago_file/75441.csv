Little Goat Diner////Our waitress was exceptional on a busy Sunday night! We were seated almost immediately! Cocktails came out quick, even ordered some off menu by recommendation of our waitress and food was quick to follow! The brussel sprouts were absolutely phenomenal as were the pork belly fries!
