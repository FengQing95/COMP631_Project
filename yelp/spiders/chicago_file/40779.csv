Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place used to be a solid 5-star breakfast spot (no line! $7 bloody mary bar!) but has declined in quality a little bit. The drink prices are up ($9 bloody mary bar), and they got rid of the best part of the meal--tiny breakfast churros with chocolate dipping sauce. I miss them so! Please bring them back!
