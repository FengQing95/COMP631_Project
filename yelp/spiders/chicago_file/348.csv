Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I've been to quite a few brunch places in Chicago, and I have to say, Wildberry Cafe has the best bang for your buck. My girlfriend and I came here looking for a reasonably priced, delicious brunch, and we got not only that but more. The omelete that I had was extremely tasty, and the skillet that my girlfriend got was perfect. In addition, Wildberry let us upgrade the pancakes that were supposed to come with our entrees to special pancakes. It'll take me a few days to work off those calories, but they sure were worth it.
