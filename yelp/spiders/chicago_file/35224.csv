Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our experience at Bavette's was exceptional! Our waitperson, Shawn, was our gastronomic guide, giving us many excellent suggestions for menu options. A very ebullient and knowledgeable individual who shared his passion with us. We spent Â over 4 hrs. conversing, imbibing and dining. Fantastic! Just some of the dishes we had...The lamb chops were cooked to perfection, the lyonnaise salad was delicious and the salted caramel ice cream was to die for! I can't remember the last time that I have had such a wonderful restaurant experience. Thank you to Shawn and to Brandon.
