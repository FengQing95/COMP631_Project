The Purple Pig////The service was excellent, and while we were discussing the crystal clear ice cube in one of our drinks, one of the managers (I think) helpfully offered that they make it in a big block and then cut out the clear parts. I love tidbits of knowledge like that! They bring out the food when it's ready so you aren't going to have everything at once. Small plates are the way to go. You get to try some of a few different dishes, and you leave completely satisfied!
