Smoque BBQ////Wow!! Sliced beef brisket is to die for and the BBQ chicken is also outstanding. I highly reccomend the baked beans and cornbread for your side choices. Also if u have Any room for desert the peach cobler is a must. But again the the beef brisket and chicken are great and the cool thing is if your torn between the two you can order the chicken and add a (taste) of brisket which is a nice size portion or any other menu item on the side for a decent price. I've been there three times and never been dissapointed so I'd say there very consistent and if I didn't live almost 20 miles away I'd probably be there every weeken. If ur tryin to decide if it will be worth the trip if ur far away trust me it is.
