Little Goat Diner////We had lunch on 3/4/2020 at little goat diner. I think I can reliably say that any baked good you get from little goat will blow you away. We had crumpets, little piggy, and a grilled cheese sandwich. The bread in the grilled cheese had bacon, the crumpet was a tender fried doughy delicious thing, and the biscuit in the little piggy entree was perfect. All of the food was expertly prepared. The surprise hit was the side of pork belly home fries, absolutely amazing. Maybe the best pork belly I've ever had. The "fries" were smashed baby potatoes perfectly crisped. I usually don't care for smashed potatoes but these were delicious. Service was just ok and the noise level was pretty loud, the food more than made up for the negatives. I'm looking forward to going back.
