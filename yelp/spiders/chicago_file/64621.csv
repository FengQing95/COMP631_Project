Smoque BBQ////I did the brisket with a taste of pulled pork, mac, and fries. The brisket was just a teeeensy but dry but definitely one of the bests I've had in Chicago. It was so tender I didn't even need a knife to cut it. Sides were good-really liked the fries but mac was just ok. Pulled pork was AMAZING. Bless the pigs who sacrifice themselves for this deliciousness.
