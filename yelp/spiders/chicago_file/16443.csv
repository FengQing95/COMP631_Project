Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Not a fan of deep dish (I'm a thin-crust NY pizza kinda gal), but this stuff was good. The cheese was stretchy and fresh, and the tomatoes in the sauce were definitely not out of a can. The buttery crust is their signature, so go for that. The calamari appetizer is very good. Unlike a lot of calamari out there, it's not chewy at all. Service and crowds seem to be the main complaint of other reviewers, so do what we did--go for a late lunch around 3 pm and skip the rush. On a nice day, the outdoor seating is great, even if your service is a little slower.
