Smoque BBQ////Came here mid-afternoon on a weekend. For dine-in, you order at the counter before being given a table. A no-frills restaurant with simple decorations and furniture. Had a chopped brisket platter with slaw, chili, and baked beans. While tender, the amount of fat in the cuts of brisket was variable with some slices very fatty and others lean. The fatty slices are so delicious! When hot, it practically melts in your mouth, coating all the surfaces with savory deliciousness. The sides were solid. I liked the chili more than the baked beans. Both had a surprising amount of meat but the smokiness of the baked beans was a little too much for me. The slaw was solid with crunchy veggies flavored with a mustard sauce to balance out the more greasy meats.
