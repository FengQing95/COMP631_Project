Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////OMG, in my opinion, this is the best place for breakfast downtown Chicago! The biscuits with sausage gravy, scrambled eggs, turkey sausage and hash browns were absolutely delicious! While that is what I had this time, they have an extensive menu that will satisfy all taste buds - cannot wait to try the blueberry pancakes! However, the line can be long so wait list through Yelp ahead of time or you can always place an order for carry out! I absolutely LOVE this restaurant!
