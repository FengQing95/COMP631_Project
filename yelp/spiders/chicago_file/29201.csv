Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When in Chicago deep dish pizza is a must! And so we did! All I could say is that, Lou Malnati's deep dish sausage pizza is full of buttery, not tangy tomato sauce, and with sausage from every bite! It's so yummy from the first bite, all the way to the last bite! What surprised me the most is their calamari! It's crispy, yet tender, and has the right flavor without being salty and crumby! If all the calamari I've had at numerous restaurants, this one had been the best, so far! I even told my husband that before going back to Vegas, we need to go back to Lou Malnati's to eat their calamari again! I love this place!
