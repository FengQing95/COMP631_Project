The Purple Pig////This was my third time at the Purple Pig and my family's first. Troy was an absolutely amazing server! He was great with our kids and very attentive. Loved him! The food was over the top!!! So amazing and so much selection. The wine selection is also amazing. Highly recommend and we hope to be back!
