Art Institute of Chicago////In between the galleries there was a great little cafe that had Â a charging station, perfect for all those phone batteries that are slowly dying. The cafe also sold ADORABLE ALUMINIUM COCA-COLA BOTTLES! Being a fan of collecting stuff like this, I was pretty psyched when I saw this. They also have diet coke, Sprite, etc. in aluminum bottles too. However, once you leave the cafe area you have to put all beverages away in a bag (or pocket), regardless of whether they are capped or not.
