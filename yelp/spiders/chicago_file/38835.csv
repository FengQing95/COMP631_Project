Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Definitely a favorite steakhouse in Chicago, with the rich traditional feel and decadent steaks.  This place has been on my must-try list for over a year, but the long waitlist for tables and an unpredictable work schedule have made it nearly impossible.  My husband and I wondered in early on a weekday evening and snagged a spot at the bar which has full menu service.  It was fantastic!  Service was 5-star and steak quality was exceptional.
