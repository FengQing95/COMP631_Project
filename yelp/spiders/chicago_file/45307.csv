Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great tapas and nothing is bad that I have had from short ribs to seared tuna. The deserts are too small and the chocolate cake is just fudge so I would avoid the deserts. My favorite is figs wrapped in bacon because the bacon is always cooked well and the seet figs just melt in your mouth.
