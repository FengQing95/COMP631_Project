Smoque BBQ////You may want to consider taking the food to go as the place gets uber crowded & it rather small on the inside.  Also, try & get there early or else you will be standing in one long line.  This joint is pretty casual & the seating is not the best--it is like a cafeteria with long tables where you can sit right on top of people.  If you don't mind that, I say check them out--you probably wont be sorry.
