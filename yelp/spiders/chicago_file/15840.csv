Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////However, what ticks me off is that the bartender offered a lunch express pizza, but made it sound like the only difference between a la carte and the express is that I am limited to a sausage pizza (as opposed to the classic whatever one) and it's pre-cooked. No mention of price or the salad and drink that is included in the deal. (And why he didn't think of suggesting the deal in the first place when I ordered a small salad is totally beyond me. Many waiters have been nice enough to point out to me that there's a similar option/deal that's cheaper to save me a few bucks.)
