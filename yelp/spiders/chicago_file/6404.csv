The Purple Pig////Amazing restaurant right in Michigan Ave, perfect girls night or date night spot. My 2 besties and I were able to share all of the dishes we ordered. We asked our waitress for suggestions and her picks were delicious, the burrata, the beets and wow the pork belly was amazing! Great drinks, tasty desserts, pricey but we split it 3 ways. I will definitely go again, the next time I'm in the city!
