Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I must say my expectations were extremely high after seeing the reviews. I ordered delivery to my hotel. Since being in Chicago we had not tried thin crust pizza so gave it a go. The delivery wait was an hour which I felt was reasonable given prime time. Prices were also very reasonable. When I got the pizza I was immediately disappointed because I could tell my pizza wasn't hot. It was barely warm, but I was starving and soon found out it was still very good despite having cooled during delivery.
