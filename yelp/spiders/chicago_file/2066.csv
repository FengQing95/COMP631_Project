Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////If you are like me you may be wondering...wow could this place really be rated this high by so many yelpers? Yes it can! A must-try breakfast place while visiting Chicago. I went during a weekday morning and only waited 15 minutes for a table, but I can imagine waiting much longer on the weekend. It is worth it! The omelettes are delicious and the signature berry bliss pancakes are amazingly yummy!
