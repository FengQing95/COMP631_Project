Little Goat Diner////We fought traffic, huge crowds, and paid outrageously to park so we could eat here. Server was just rude, intentionally. She cut me off as I asked a question and refused to make eye contact.  It is one's choice to work in a busy establishment.  If you are unable to deal with the public perhaps you should seek other employment.  Really disappointed.
