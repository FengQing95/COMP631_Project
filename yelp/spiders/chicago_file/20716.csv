Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////During the wait, walk to the end of the block and go into the bar/ resteruant (Bear and the Bull I think its called), and grab a beer. It will likely be too crowded to stay at Lou's and grab a beer there. Watch whatever game is on. Nod to the other people who are also waiting for Lou's to call them. Wait for your phone call.
