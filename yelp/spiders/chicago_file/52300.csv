Smoque BBQ////Smoque has the Best tasting bbq meat I've ever tasted. The only thing holding me back from giving it the coveted fifth star is the fact that I'm not really into the sauce. It's not a bad sauce , but I'm a smokey flavored sweet thick Kansas city style sauce. The sauce at Smoque is more of a vinegar based heavily spiced sauce, pretty thin. I have tried the baby back ribs (fantastic) and the pulled pork (equally fantastic). The baked beans are the best I've had and the cole slaw is very good. I even love the hand cut fries , great. The prices are lowish average , and the dining room is nothing to shake a stick at , but clean. This is my new official favorite bbq joint , if I pick up a jar of Heckys in Evanston's sauce and caramelize it a bit , I'll probably have a plate full of 5 star ribs.
