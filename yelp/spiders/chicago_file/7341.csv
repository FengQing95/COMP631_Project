Art Institute of Chicago////I visited this morning for the opening of the new modern wing, and I was completely blown away.  I've visited the art institute several times over the years, and I always felt that their selection of 20th century art was somewhat lacking.  They remedied this problem in incredibly grand fashion with this new addition to the museum.
