Smoque BBQ////If you haven't tried Smoque BBQ you are definitely missing out! I honestly believe there's no one better doing BBQ in the Chi! My usual go to is the full slab (meat falls right off the bone with one bite) with Mac and cheese and fries! ($23?) I've also tried their pulled pork in the past and it's juicy and tender. Their cole slaw is not your traditional slaw, it's more of a vinegary slaw which gives the bbq sauce a nice contrast! I love it! Portions are pretty large and filling. Expect to A. wait in a long line and B pay your traditional BBQ joint prices: Example: meal for two will cost you $40ish? But totally worth it! My mouth watered writing this review and I can't wait to go back! Also this is probably not the best place to go for a first date unless you can care less about stuffing your face and getting messy or maybe it's totally the best place to go on a first date and if they call you after, they're worth keeping around!
