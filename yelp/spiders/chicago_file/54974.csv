Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The best way to do tapas is gathering a bunch of hungry people together and basically ordering one (or four) items from each of the categories - veggies/cheeses, seafood, chicken/pork, beef/lamb. Some of the standouts for me were roast dates with bacon and burrata with bread and tomato marmalade. I'm a big fan of sweet/salty, and the flavors of both those dishes were richly complex. I also really liked the brussels sprouts salad, mixed greens salad, grilled squid, and the ham/chorizo plate. I could have done without the fried calamari or garlic potato salad, but I think other people liked it. We ended the meal with the caramelized banana and chocolate cake which were both SO good.
