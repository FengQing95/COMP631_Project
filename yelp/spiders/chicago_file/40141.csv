Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This should be a restaurant that everyone in Chicago should try at least once. If you don't have the money, save up for the experience! It was sincerely one of the best experiences I've had eating steak. The sides were just as good as well! We got the dry aged bone in rib-eye, filet mignon, mashed potatoes, Brussels sprouts, and mac and cheese. Seriously can't go wrong with anything! I already want to go again haha!
