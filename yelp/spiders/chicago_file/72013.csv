Little Goat Diner////The BF, his brother and I came here for brunch a while back. While we waited, I enjoyed an AMAZING Bloody Mary (I'm pretty sure it had kimchi in it...and it was delicious) in the bar/bakery area. We had requested a booth, and didn't mind waiting for the crowds to subside. Even when we were called, it took a few minutes to get our table, but it was well worth the wait. The hostesses were incredibly polite and apologetic with the delays.
