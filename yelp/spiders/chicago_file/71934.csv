Little Goat Diner////So I'm the type of person that hardly ever branches out or changes my meal at a certain restaurant. At little goat for instance I know the elvis waffles are amazing...I get them everytime. I keep saying next time I will try this or the sandwiches but I never do. I miss little goat since I moved, might bring my husband here on our next visit.
