Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Chicago has some of the best steakhouses in the country and there are a lot of options. I've been wanting to try Bavettes for some time now and finally made it. It did not disappoint! Went on a friday night at 8 PM and the place was packed (as usual- it can take months to get in at a good time). The inside is small but beautiful and they have a basement "speakeasy" with additional seating. Went with 2 other couples we started with the baked goat cheese. Fantastic, baked with a little red sauce and comes with garlic toast. Speaking of bread, the sour dough bread they bring warm and sliced 2 inches thick is unbelievable. Soft, tangy and chewy inside and a crispy crust on the outside. Next we had the Maude, a 2 tiered seafood extravaganza: giant shrimp, whole lobster, salmon ceviche, east and west coast oysters and king crab legs. Wow, just wow. I had to get a steak so I went with the filet cooked medium, it was perfectly cooked, soft and tender as butter and had amazing flavor. For sides we had the frittes which were great and the Mexican elotes, spicey and delicious. I also tasted a few of the other entrees at our table the beef stroganoff which was good and cheeseburger which was fantastic. For dessert we split the salted caramel ice cream which is the best I ever had, the lemon meringue pie which was awesome and the chocolate cake which was equally amazing. All In all one of the best meal I've ever had. I highly recommend you try Bavettes and will definitely be back!!
