Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For a romantic dinner, you really can't do better.  It's super sexy and dark, and the booths downstairs are perfect for hanging and looking good.  Food is very good.  The top rec is the tomato and bacon salad - it's disturbingly good.  The steak is all great; fried chicken a little meh. Perfect drinks, good service from guys who are dressed in 1890's outfit with beards (you know what I mean).  You can sit for a long time - they don't care.  The bar upstairs is a great second course - really fun and same sort of spirit, but rowdy sexy mildly ambient music, dim as hell.  To me it's the perfect place to go and feel fine and lux.
