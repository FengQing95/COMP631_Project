Little Goat Diner////I wandered into the diner as my chosen restaurant had a long waiting time. We were seated quickly and were given a direct view of the kitchen. Even though there was a crowd of people to serve, the server was kind enough to recommend some great options. We chose the Bullseye French Toast, paired with the chocolate malt beer and the Shrimp noodles, along with the house beer. The food was terrific. I chose the french toast and fulfilled my dream of eating breakfast with beer.
