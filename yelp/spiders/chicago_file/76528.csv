Little Goat Diner////Bustling brunch spot that offers unique food options at above average prices. The food was amazing, and is what gives this restaurant a solid 4-stars. However, don't expect to be in and out of the diner too quickly. First off, the wait to get into the restaurant is long but expected. The place is pretty popular and so a wait is not surprising. However, it felt at moments as though the hosts were forgetting about some of the parties that were waiting for tables (despite what appeared to be a fully electronic seating tracker system). Once you sit down, make sure to scan the menu quickly for what you want, especially if you are sitting outside, since the servers only come around to check up on you every fortnight. The wait between ordering and getting food takes just as long. The longest wait for my party happened when we paid for our check. I almost felt inclined to ask if there was something wrong with our check or my card that would have justified the substantial delay. Again, I cannot stress enough just how delicious and unique the food is at the Little Goat Diner. This is the major draw of the restaurant. However, keep in mind that you may have to block out a good amount of time in your day if you want to dine here. The restaurant is always bustling though, so don't take the wait time personally or blame it on the hard-working hosts and servers.
