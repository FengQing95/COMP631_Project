Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For entrees we had the Fried Chicken, Short Rib Stroganoff, Steak Frites, and Hamburger; sides of Bacon and the Elote.  The person who had the burger said he preferred Bavette's burger over Au Chevals.  He thought it was seasoned better.(he thought the Au Cheval burger was a sodium bomb)  My fried chicken was great, if a little greasy. I didn't ask about the steak frites or the stroganoff but I didn't hear any complaints.  Elotes was really good too.
