Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Loved everything about this place. Johnny was a very engaging and on point waiter, drinks were great, steak was cooked to perfection, music selection was great (maybe a tad bit loud - just made us sit closer to hear each other speak ;). The Hubby and I will definitely keep this on the list of "our spots" in Chicago.
