Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I loved the idea of making your own Bloody Mary at the bar. Everything is setup for you at the bar. They bring you a glass of vodka on ice and the rest is up to you. Tapas for brunch is not something I'm accustomed to having because I love breakfast and I don't like to share my food. I tend to be a picky eater. But this place changed my mind about it because I enjoyed everything we ordered. Food is great and the patio side of the restaurant is nice. I believe the roof of the patio opens, but it was not nice enough that day to see it I guess.
