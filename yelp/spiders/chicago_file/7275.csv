Art Institute of Chicago////    I'm not sure I understand this institutions finances but I just don't think that the price of admission should be quickly getting beyond the reach of illinoisians just wanting to enjoy a day downtown.  (The same trend  holds true for every museum in Chicago, as they have all given in to the grab for revenues).
