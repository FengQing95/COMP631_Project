Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The steak came out great with a nice crisp to it.  I had to dock one star for the absurdly dull steak knife they gave me to cut up my steak. At times, I had to double check they didn't overcook my steak to make it well done since it was hard to cut my steak.  Luckily, it was just a dull knife.  When I brought that up to the bartender, she seemed to have heard that complaint before.
