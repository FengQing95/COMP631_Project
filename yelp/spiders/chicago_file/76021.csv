Little Goat Diner////Although I've never been a fan of the restaurant, I used to stop by the LG coffee bar with some frequency. Little Goat makes great coffee and the people working the coffee bar are incredibly friendly. The coffee bar was always awkwardly designed, but a recent remodel turned it into a logistical disaster. There's no natural place to stand out of the way of other customers while you wait for your coffee. It's not worth the hassle.
