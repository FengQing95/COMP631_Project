Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place was hyped up before we even got there. It was a 30 minute wait but it went quick and we put our order in as we were waiting so the pizza arrived just 10 mins after sitting down. Lou's lived up to the hype. We got a small pizza and a bruschetta to share and we left feeling like beached whales. That's a lot of food for a couple.
