Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is the real deal Spanish tapas. Rockin' Friday night without reservations 90 minute wait! We hawked a bar table and got lucky because the place was packed--and it's huge! Food is amazing. Be warned that veggie paella takes 40 minutes, minimum two people for that dish. Sangria was awesome. Get the olives for sure, and potato salad, and tortilla de patatas. Best meal in Chicago by far!!
