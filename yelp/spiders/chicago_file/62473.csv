Smoque BBQ////St. Louis Ribs took a small 1 pt dive. Maybe it's because it's not new anymore, I don't know. 8 is still very respectable; problem is, I don't think I'll ever crave Smoque for it. The rib meat itself is great, but I don't want to have JUST ribs, I want sauce, and if the rib meat is good, but sauce sucks, then it just crapsizes the whole experience.
