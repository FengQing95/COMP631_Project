Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Lastly, we didn't leave without having a slice of the chocolate cream pie. I was stuffed, so I only took a couple bites, but the flavors were very rich and it was the perfect cap to a delicious meal. I would definitely recommend splitting dessert if you're as full as I was after the entrees. Bavette's is delicious and I have no doubt that their steaks are top notch. I would highly recommend this place for a great upscale experience.
