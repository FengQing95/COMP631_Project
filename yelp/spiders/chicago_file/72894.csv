Little Goat Diner////Probably my favorite on their menu is their crab dip. Its AMAZING. They serve breakfast all day, and their "Asian style breakfast tasty thing" is amazing. Pancakes serving as bread with mixed bacon and eggs on the inside Â $60 for drinks, 1 appetizer, & 2 meals...I was impressed, and will def be coming back.
