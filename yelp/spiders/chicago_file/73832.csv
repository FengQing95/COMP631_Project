Little Goat Diner////i wish the biscuits were swapped out w/the crumpets instead but the mushroom gravy is good enough alone. there could have been more gravy or a sunny side egg over the hash but thee hash does not lose out. there's some serious game in it of unknown origins. is it in the cheese? did they mix in some liver fois or grill it on the same griddle as the proteins? i haven't figured it out but it's magical. the hash is what all hash should aspire to emulate. long slender potato noodles grilled to a crispy goodness but eats like a hearty pasta that complements any breakfast food.
