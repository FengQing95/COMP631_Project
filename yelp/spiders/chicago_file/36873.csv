Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////First, the upstairs bar is what will greet you once the hostess escorts you through the main entrance. It's a beautiful set up with a classic antique look. Then if you're taken downstairs, the bar and dining area take on more of a speakeasy feel. Dim lighting and candles make this area ideal for date night dinner. It's best just said that the decor and overall layout are flawless.
