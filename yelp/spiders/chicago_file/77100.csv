Little Goat Diner////We ordered biscuits and gravy, pork belly pancake, goat pattie melt, and the chicken pot pie. The biscuits and gravy was thick and had generous amounts of meat in the gravy. The pork belly pancake was flavorful and sweet. The chicken pot pie was dry and too salty. It was not very large and was rather pricey. My favorite dish was the pattie melt. The goat burger was meaty and was not too gamey. The burger was so juicy.
