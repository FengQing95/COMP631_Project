Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have had a few organizations message me to change their reviews. At first they offer a deal or an inventive to go back and retry, but normally I politely decline since I already had a bad experience the first time and don't see how going again when they are on their best behavior would solve anything. The companies then have proceeded to flat out ask me to change the review with various excuses or even angry threats. Lou's did not even mention anything at all about changing the review. It appears they just were genuinely trying to make sure I ended up being happy with the service!
