Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This place has an amazing vibe--one of the best in the city. One feels transported in time and place (maybe Paris circa 1890's). I enjoy their cocktails (gin gimlet) and hop all over the menu--from beef to seafood (we have dined here numerous times as we are within walking distance). Although they have wildly great steaks, I tend to gravitate toward items off the beaten path.They often have an amazing shrimp de jonghe (right now they are doing a scampi) on the menu that is earth shattering.
