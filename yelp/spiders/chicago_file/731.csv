Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I had the veggie omelet with fruit and the pumpkin pancakes.  The pancakes were out of this world --- OUT OF THIS WORLD, I tell you!  The omelet was . . . . oily.  Or something.  I'm not sure if it was too much butter or too much oil, but it was definitely prepared with too much of some sort of fat.  I might give their omelets another go when I go back and see if they can go super easy on the oils.  Would definitely go back for the pancakes though.  My coworker had the pumpkin french toast (did I mention that both pumpkin dishes came with ginger butter!?!?) and said it was also to die for.
