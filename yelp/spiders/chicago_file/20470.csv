Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We came here for dinner on the day of the Saint Patrick's parade. Needless to say, even at 9 p.m., the streets were swarming with people in the restaurant had a mile long line. We put our name on the list and were surprised at how quickly we were seated. The restaurant staff handled the crowds really well.
