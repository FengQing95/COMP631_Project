Art Institute of Chicago////Went on "free day" Thursday, which turns out to be only free for locals.  That is a shame, because the Art Museum in Houston is free for all on Thursdays. You could lie about where you are from since they only ask for a zip code, but I try to avoid that myself.  The line for "free day" was long, but it does move fast so don't be disheartened.  Inside the exhibits are nicely laid out and there is much to see depending upon your tastes.  One odd thing is that they have a rule about wearing purses/backpacks/etc on your back.  My friend was wearing her purse on her back and an attendant said she could only wear it by one strap on her side or carry it.  So she proceeds to one strap it only to be told later she can only wear it on her front or carry it.  Needless to say others were wearing them on their back often in the same room and weren't even second thought. So whatever the rule is, it isn't enforced properly and I don't see it clearly labeled anywhere.  They might want to put signs about the rule at the entrance and especially at the ticket counters to avoid confusion.  Don't know why they have that rule to begin with for a decent amount of the exhibits if you get to close the alarm will go off.  Other than that the experience was nice though.
