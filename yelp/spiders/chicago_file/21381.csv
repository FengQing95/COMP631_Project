Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Then the pizza came.  We ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic, which came at the recommendation of our server.  It was essentially pizza crust, topped with a THICK layer of cheese, thin layer of tomato sauce, then a layer of meat.  The pizza was so dry and hardened quickly as it cooled (especially the cheese), making it difficult to cut into a mere 3 minutes after it arrived.  It was so bland too, all I tasted was the calories.  I was brought up to not waste food but after one slice I couldn't bring myself to finish another.
