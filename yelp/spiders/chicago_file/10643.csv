Art Institute of Chicago////If you are big on art, this is the place to go to in Chitown. Not my thing so I give it only 4 stars. Way too many people as well. Not a place for children, they won't enjoy it and they might get bored real quick. The line to get in can be insane, but we had the hop on hop off passes, which got us in threw will call.
