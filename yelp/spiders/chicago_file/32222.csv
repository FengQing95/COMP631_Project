Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////But much praise, and the reason for a full 5 stars, is our server Nick. (Take note, folks!) He was incredibly warm and welcoming from the moment we arrived. He was helpful with menu suggestions and descriptions, he was quick and efficient with additional requests, and even double-checked with us about certain dishes and gluten sensitivities. He's a valuable addition to this establishment, and I hope he's properly acknowledged for it.
