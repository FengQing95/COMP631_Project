Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I came here to celebrate a late valentines dinner and boy, was it memorable. The ambiance is very romantic and dim lit with beautiful suspended lights but BOY, lets talk about THAT RIBEYE. Oh MAN, that piece of steak was amazing! I got the medium rare ribeye and it was the best steak I've ever had. I've dined at other steak houses such as Mastros, Cut, Mortons, and Ruths Chris but Bavette's is by far my favorite. The steak (medium rare) was so extremelyyyyyyyy tender and flavorful. The salt seasoning is left on the side is great compliment to the meat. Guests can sprinkle the seasoning to their own preference. The truffle mac and cheese was also amazing. My favorite truffle mac and cheese is from Tokyo Fried Chicken (Monterey Park, CA) but this truffle mac and cheese was better- the best.
