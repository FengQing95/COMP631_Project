Art Institute of Chicago////This museum was pretty awesome. There is a beautiful garden to the side of it which is nice for taking pictures. And there's a huge sculpture there which reminded me of the art I usually see in Europe. The museum itself has lions in the front entrance of it, so it's a very easy find. The museum is huge and has a lot of different rooms, so I suggest you go early to check out as much as you can. Loved this museum. I am attaching some of my favorite paintings I saw.
