Little Goat Diner////This place is overrated, but I do enjoy the shrimp wrap dish they have on the menu.  Other than that... their chai lattes are TERRIBLE and they rest of the food is so/so, but nice to have around if you need an occasional change in pallet.  I say occasional as it's a heavy, rich, murky food that you will probably only be able to put down once or twice a year.
