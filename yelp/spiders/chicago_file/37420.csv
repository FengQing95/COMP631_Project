Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The restaurant's 1920's gatsby era feel boosted the rating from the get go.  We were seated at a round candle lit table in the basement.  Large red plush chairs make you feel like dining like a king or queen.  If you are seeking a romantic night out then Bavettes will serve you well.
