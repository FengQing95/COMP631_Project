Art Institute of Chicago////Let's get the facts out of the way: The Art Institute of Chicago is one of the premier art museums in the world. And I was lucky enough to grow up in the Chicago area and thus grew up cultivating my interest in art right here. Now, I'm grown up, I've seen a lot of other great art museums of the world and I'm also a grad student at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. So, I still have every reason to be a supportive, engaged patron. Right? Right. Except that today, when I took my mother to see Matisse, on this, a "free" Thursday night, they wouldn't let us in to see the exhibit because we were not members. Now, I don't mind if they want people to pay something extra on a "free" night to see a special exhibit. Or if this information had been prominently displayed at the entrance to the museum and made very clear and plain on the Website, then it certainly would have been my bad. But it wasn't posted anywhere where we entered, which was the Modern Wing entrance and the entire time we stood in line at the entrance to the Matisse exhibit, it was also not mentioned. Well, until we got to the front of the line and were disallowed in. Frankly, I think this is a crappy policy overall and it does more harm than good for the image of the museum. Yes, they did succeed in selling me a student membership, thus allowing us into the show, but under regular circumstances (i.e., had I not been with my mother) I would have walked out. Hey, ARTIC: get over yourselves and be kind to the masses, at least on "free" night, ok? The outrageous price of admission on most days should more than make up for this one little act of kindness.
