Little Goat Diner////Little goat is probably one of my favorite things about Chicago. The food is AMAZING every time I go. Today was the fish tostadas and a Bloody Mary. As per usual it was delicious. I try to get different items each time I come in. Slowly working my way thru the menu. It's all worth it.
