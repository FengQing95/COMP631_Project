Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It was far less soggy than last time, but there was still excessive moisture that formed on the top.  My husband and I both think it's because there are chunks of tomatoes in the tomato sauce.  Even so, the pizza came out far better than it did last time I posted a review.  The crust is really awesome if you can keep it from getting soggy.  I don't know, maybe it's because of our altitude here (8600 feet).  It turned out much better this time, and I can tell that this restaurant's pizza overall is really good.
