The Purple Pig////Our waiter was friendly and fine, though I asked him what he'd recommend for an appetizer and he kind of rambled off a bunch of items without any enthusiasm. It was a little odd to me, like isn't there something on the menu you enjoy? Ah well, besides that he was friendly and attentive enough.
