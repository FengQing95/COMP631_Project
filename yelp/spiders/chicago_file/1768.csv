Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Came here on a Friday morning around 7:45a and the wait was still 40 mins. The food came out quickly which caused the quality to be compromised. The hash browns, onions and broccoli in my skillet were all undercooked. Pretty disappointing. On a positive note, the portions were decent Â and the pancakes were good.
