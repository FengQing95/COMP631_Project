Little Goat Diner////I have been here several times & have never been let down. This weekend I took an out of town friend there for brunch. The wait was reasonable & the hostesses did a great job managing all the guests. Once seated, our server came right away & thoroughly explained the menu and specials. Our food came out quickly & was beyond expectation! I not only give this restaurant my highest recommendation, but I'm already planning my next visit.
