Little Goat Diner////Went here for a going away party with 6-7 people, we sat comfortably in a booth and walked in with only a 30 minute wait on a week night. We drank at the bar in the bakery area while we waited. Really like this casual take off of A Girl and A Goat which is just across the street. I had the Sloppy Goat and loved it! It was a lot of food though so I didn't finish it and took the leftovers home. Our server was really efficient and very hipster, and the rest of the party really enjoyed the the Goat Almighty and the Patty Melt.
