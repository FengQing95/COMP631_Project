Art Institute of Chicago////Art, for years has been subjective, perhaps submissive at times and distorted. But all share the same thing- a form of beautiful expression. Timeless in display, the art institution of Chicago houses one of the world's most notable collections. These eyes of mine, yes these very two sockets came to visualise one of the masterpieces of Leonardo Di Vinci. Why is it something so old, so lost, yet there can seem so real yet so fake? Ive come to realise when you're faced to something that has been echoed all around you, comes to fore- makes you numb. To truly appreciate someone's hard work. Its takes a open mind and a open heart. This place speaks on so many levels. The institution is unbelievably enormous, You' need a day to truly absorb it all.
