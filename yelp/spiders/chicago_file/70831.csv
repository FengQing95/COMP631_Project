Little Goat Diner////Little goat has a nice atmosphere for friends and families alike.  They serve adult bevvies for the crowd looking for a little fun, they serve milkshakes and diner drinks for tame evenings or kids.  Their menu ranges from breakfast sweet and savory treats, to monster sized goat laiden burgers and more on the lunch/dinner side.  Prices are quite reasonable (8-12 per entree is a great estimation) and the servings are quite ample for even the hungriest of diners.
