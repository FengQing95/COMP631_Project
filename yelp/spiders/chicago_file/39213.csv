Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////By far the best filet I have had in Chicago.  Went here for dinner and while it is a little pricey it was well worth it.  Nothing we had was bad and the service was great.  The place has a very cozy feeling to it and you kind of feel like you go back in time a little bit once you step through the doors.  They have other options than just steak, but why bother?
