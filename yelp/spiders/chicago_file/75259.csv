Little Goat Diner////Love. Attended an event upstairs.  All of the appetizers were amazing, goat empanadas, ahi, oysters. Then the dinner was even better. Cashew green beans, roasted cauliflower, sea bass and lamb ribs. If I had room I would have had seconds. The tiny strawberry shortcake was ok. Nice size but a more simple marinated strawberry without the unnecessary  carbs would have been better. Service was impeccable.
