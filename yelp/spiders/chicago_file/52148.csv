Smoque BBQ////I went for the first time last night after seeing that it was on DD&D and only a ten minute drive from me. I've always envied Guy's job so I figured I could pretend to be him for a night. I get there at eight pm on a Tuesday night, and the place was packed! I waited in line for about ten minutes and got my food ten minutes later. I took it to go since there was no seats.
