Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We went last week. We had to put down a deposit and requested outdoor seating. When we arrived, all the tables were spaced appropriately and divided by shrubbery. All staff wore masks and everything was contactless. We were given a QR code to access the menu and to pay. Our waitress, Barb was very nice and attentive.
