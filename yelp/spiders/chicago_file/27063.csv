Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Two buddies and I were in Chicago for the weekend and we tried to get into Malnati's on a Friday night, ummm..that will be an hour wait. So we tried again on Saturday and put our name in four the hour wait and headed next door to grab a beer.  Perfect plan. Plus you can order your pizza while you are waiting, because those deep dish pizzas take about  1/2 hour to cook. Those are some dense pizzas.
