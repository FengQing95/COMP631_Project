Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pizza was great. Got the classic just the way it was. Family ordered a medium, it was a party of 3. We ordered the garlic three cheese bread as an appetizer to hold the appetite. That bread was delicious. Pizza came out with in 20 minutes of sitting down, was you order it before they sit you down. Pizza was delicious, the entire family loved it. The sauce I loved and the crust was yummy. We couldn't eat the entire pie, only one slice a person. So keep the portion in mind.
