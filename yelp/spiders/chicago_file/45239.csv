Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////So I know it's sort of a trendy, yuppie-type place to hang out, but you just can't beat the tapas and sangria combo! If you go on Friday night and wait at the bar until 10 pm, they have $3 tapas (limited selection but the selections are good ones!) and of course, the sangria flows like wine. Wait, it is made from wine. Never mind....
