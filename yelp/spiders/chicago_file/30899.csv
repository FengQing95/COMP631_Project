Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place is busy but they let you pre-order your pizza while you wait for your table.. the Malnati salad was unexpected, and the candied bacon was a great touch. The malnati classic Chicago was heavy but delicious. One slice with half salad was extremely filling.. the small pizza left us both with a slice to take home. The stuffed spinach bread was a bit much after the salad and the pizza but I wasn't mad at the couple bites I had.
