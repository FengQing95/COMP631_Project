Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The ambiance is cozy and clubby--a romantic and contemporary take on a dark bistro with smoky mirrors and leather booths. The jazz soundtrack was loud enough to hear but not so loud as to interfere with conversation, and the music selection was a perfect complement to the environment and decor. The place welcomed patrons spanning many decades from 20s to 70s. The attire is comfortable and stylish on the dressy side.
