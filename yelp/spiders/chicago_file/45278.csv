Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been to Ba Ba Reeba a few times before and it was good, but not as authentic as I would have liked. Personally, I vote Cafe Iberico as most authentic. Some of the dishes at BBR had a Spanish influence, while others did not (ie. beef medallions with potato chips?? sounds more American to me). As a whole, I guess I just didn't think it was all that special. But don't listen to me, because apparently I'm the only one who feels that way as there are mobs of people waiting to eat here...
