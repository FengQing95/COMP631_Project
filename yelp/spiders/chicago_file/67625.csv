Little Goat Diner////It was 10:15am when we were ordering and we were informed that the whole menu was open to order from. My dad ordered the corned beef hash(even though I told him to live a little) and I ordered the shrimp and pork belly. I was surprised when my food came, it was in a large bowl and I was only able to eat about a quarter of it before becoming full.
