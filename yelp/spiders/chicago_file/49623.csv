Smoque BBQ////OK .. I come from the LAND OF BBQ!!! KC,MO.. thats what we are KNOWN FOR!! well umm JAZZ TOO! but ok.. SO I go here after seeing this Sandwhich on the cover of Time Out Chicagos Magazine and my mouth Watered. I drove the distance for this sandwhich.. and low and behold.. OK.. Well.. It was good .. Very very SWEET. I'm a junk Food junkie but this was a tad bit SWEET for me.. Second time i went.. much better.. maybe the cook just fumbled with the sugar once before so I am happy that I game them a second chance. Their fries are decent. They aren't GATES BBQ Fries but they are good. ...Worth a visit
