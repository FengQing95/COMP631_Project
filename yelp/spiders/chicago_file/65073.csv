Smoque BBQ////After about a 10 minute wait we made it to the counter. We decided to order a few things and split them as the menu didn't feature a multiple meat platter. I ordered a half rack of baby back ribs with fries and my friend ordered the brisket sandwich with mac & cheese and coleslaw. Within minutes of ordering I got tapped on the shoulder and the host had our table ready. Perfect! Like a well oiled machine.
