Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We come to this restaurant for all special occasions for the past 5 years and so it was a surprise when we ordered our favorite carmal sauce banana waffles, that it was changed to nutella! Not the  same and wasn't good. The spinach stuffed mushroom(31) didn't taste the same and had very little sauce with this hard plastic like cheese on top. The spinach crepe, spicy potatoes, chicken panadas was good. I figured they either had a different chef or they cut back.  Will be back but won't be our special place anymore.
