Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of my favorite things about the restaurant is that you can order "1 bite" portions of tapas for super cheap, around $1-3. .  Its a way to get the best from a tapas experience while not getting hit too hard on the bill.  The 1 bite tapas are really good too! This past sunday we had the dates stuffed with goat cheese and wrapped in bacon (delish) and the pepper stuffed with meat.  Very yummy as well!
