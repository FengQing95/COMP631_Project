Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Tried this place for the first time last weekend. I would say it's a couple steps up from IHOP. Our coffee mugs had a little bit of food leftover from the previous user, which our server spotted as she was setting them down on our table. She quickly took them back and got us new (clean) cups. For food I had the garden skillet which came with mushrooms, asparagus, spinach, and broccoli mixed with eggs and cheese over potatoes. The portions were huge! I could only finish 1/3 of my dish. Overall it was good, but not great.
