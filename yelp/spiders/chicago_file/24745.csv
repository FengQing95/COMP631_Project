Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Thank you for writing a review, Bob!  Very happy to hear you enjoyed the pizzas that your daughter and son-in-law shipped to you.  Our Tastes of Chicago division is definitely a favorite among out-of-town Lou's fans.  We look forward to serving you a pizza from the pan the next time you visit Chicago.  Cheers!
