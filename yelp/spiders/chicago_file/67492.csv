Little Goat Diner////The menu has a little bit of everything including breakfast items, a large selection of unique sandwiches and burgers, and larger entrees. It is mostly interesting dishes that I haven't heard of before, or spins on classic dishes that the chef has put their own signature style on. I ended up with a Los Drowned sandwich that consisted of braised beef, avocado, butter case cheese, pickled peppers and onions, and spicy mayo on a hoagie served au jus. I thought the sandwich was delicious. The cheese was my favorite part, but the braised beef was also perfectly done. Even with my amateur palette, I could appreciate the combination of the many ingredients on this sandwich coming together without having one thing overpower another. I also went with the "fall in a glass" cocktail which was a whiskey based drink. While I liked everything I had, I think that the prices were really pushing the upper end of what I would pay for this again. It's all รก la carte, and a sandwich and side is going to put you around the $20 area for a full meal. The unique creations are what get the extra money from me, but I don't think the individual ingredients themselves were much to write home about. Having a cool menu that features a lot of things that I haven't found anywhere else is what bumps this place up to a 4 star for me. I would skip on the cocktail next time, as it was good but nothing special.
