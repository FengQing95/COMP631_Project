We're glad to hear that you got seated in a reasonable time frame and that you were promptly waited on, but we apologize that you were not as comfortable as you were hoping to be. It also sounds like you found some of your dishes a bit underwhelming, and we are sorry to hear that. We strive to ensure that our customers are comfortable and satisfied with their dishes, so we apologize that we dropped the ball. We'd love to have you back and make it up to you. Please reach out to Tina Majethia, our Assistant Director of Operations, at (312) 888-3455 if you have any further feedback about your experience with us.
