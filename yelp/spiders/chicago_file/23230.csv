Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My friend won a gift card to Lou Malnati's and so we stopped in to the carry-out location on Damen. We walked it home, and then made a salad so it was just a touch cold when we finally sat down to eat. Definitely need to eat it hot! It was good, but not OMG my mind is blown good. Just typical Chicago-style deep dish. I've been eating left-overs the past couple of days and it's not any better the day after.
