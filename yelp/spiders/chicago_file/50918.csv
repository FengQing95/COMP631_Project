Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We came here on a Sunday night with reservations. Upon checking in, we were told we can sit by the bar and we will get called. We waited about 5 to 10 minutes even though we were on time for our reservation. I guess that is how they operate, but I think 5 to 10 minutes is a little too long for a restaurant that was about half full/ half empty.
