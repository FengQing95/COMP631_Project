Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Delicious hand-made pizza! Deep dish pizza shipped from Chicago to Florida. First time ordering pizza to be shipped from another state, but it was worth it. I was so worried about the packaging and quality. The items came well packed in a foam cooler with dry ice. The package arrived around 3pm via UPS and I got home about 4 hours later and the items were still frozen. I am very happy with the quality and taste. I really like the taste of the vine ripped tomatoes, cheese, toppings, and yummy crust. The pizza came with clear cooking instructions and it cooked perfectly. Also, their customer service line was very friendly and professional. They are a little bit expensive, but worth it. I will definitely order again.
