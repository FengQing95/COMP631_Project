Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was so excited to come here after reading on all the great reviews on yelp.   I came here Tuesday afternoon after my big bus tour.   I got the classic pie but was a bit disappointed with the crust.  It was really doughy borderline raw in some spots.  Probably the oven wasn't hot enough.  Fortunately the sausage and sauce was incredibly good.
