Little Goat Diner////The korean burger was also pretty great--served with kimchi and bacon and spicy sauce. It was juicy and tasty and is another reason why the fusion menu here between classic American dishes with a little Asian fusion flare works so well for my tastebuds. It can be a long wait here, but they do their best to pump out fresh food as quickly as they can. And there is so much I want to come back and try!
