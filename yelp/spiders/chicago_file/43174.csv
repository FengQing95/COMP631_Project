Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Service was nice, tapas was better than I remembered. We got the bacon wrapped dates, brussel sprout salad, potaters, and squid.  All were pretty perfect.  Pomegranate sangria was yummy, if a touch too sweet.  It was my friend's b-day and we got a delicious caramel tart with whipped cream and a candle! Yay!
