The Purple Pig////The atmosphere and food was amazing! The server had good recommendations and was knowledgeable about the menu items. You definitely need to get there early or reserve a table because it gets crowded quickly, but you can still get open seating at the bar if you've got a small group. We got lucky and got to sit at the bar right away. We would definitely get the papardelle pasta again- incredible flavors and perfectly cooked. The gyro wasn't quite what we expected but not bad. The blade steak was juicy and flavorful.
