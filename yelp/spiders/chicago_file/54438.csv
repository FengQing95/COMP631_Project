Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Hands down the best meal we had while visiting Chicago.  The tapas were a very nice setup to the paella, which brought down the house for our entire dinner party.  Very busy but to be expected given the quality of the service and staff.  Maggie was our server and she was very attentive and helpful during the entire meal selection process.  She and her teammates kept our glasses full and table clean as we worked through our meal.  We will make this an absolute stop when we return in the spring.  Thank you for making our dinner a memorable one.  Special thanks to Maggie for all your help; we will ask for you in the future.
