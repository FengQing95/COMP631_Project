Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The menu is pretty straightforward.  We were a party of 4 so we decided to start out with a salad and ordered 2 deep dish pies.  I think we got 2 large pies - let me tell you - that was way too much food.  My wife and I only had four of the eight slices.  I think we were a little off because we are from the NY/NJ area and the pizza is much different.
