Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great food, huge portions, really reasonably priced.  That would sum up Lou Malnati's.  Although the wait for a table of 4 was something like 30 minutes, it worked out perfectly because we pre-ordered our deluxe pizza with butter crust and it was timed perfectly with the rest of the meal.  We started off with a Malnati salad which was very good yet beyond the capacity of four guys to finish.  The pizza came and we were only able to finish about half of it even though we were trying to force ourselves to finish it so we wouldn't have to return to the apartment with leftovers to drop off before a night out on the town.  Turns out returning to the apartment with leftovers after dinner worked in our favor because leftover Lou Malnati's tastes even better when you're drunk at 2 in the morning.
