Little Goat Diner////IMO, this place is not that good, but it isn't all that terrible.  We ordered the bull's eye French toast and the pork belly pancake.  For the price of these items.... I felt like we got ripped off because it seems like the restaurant tried to hard to justify the price that the dishes we ordered were just edible and we didn't get the feeling of "yummy...I want to eat this again."
