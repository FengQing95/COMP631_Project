Art Institute of Chicago////My favorite painting at AI is Gustave Caillebotte's Paris Street; Rainy Day but it also has works by James McNeill Whistler, John Sargent Singer, and Winslow Homer, Marc Chagall's American Windows glass mural, Frank Lloyd Wright designs and other Prairie-style architectural works, Hiroshige wood block prints, and European masterworks. Additionally, it has one of the largest art museum gift stores in the U.S.
