Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The selection of tapas is as robust as it is rich - you will leave here with a food coma if you do it right.  The ambiance is loud and vibrant, just what you would expect from a place serving Spanish food.  Major points because the roof opens up at night in the summer.  Each patron is encouraged to order ~2 tapas so the table has a chance to share and taste everything.  I highly recommend the brussels sprout salad, the spicy potatoes, and the burrata.  My only complaint is that our food came out in small waves with no perceived order and our waitress was snippy/unhelpful when we inquired about the rest of the dishes.
