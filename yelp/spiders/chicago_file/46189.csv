Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have gone twice within the last couple weeks, once with a group of five and the other with just a girlfriend. Although the time I went as a group, I had even MORE fun with just a table for two. Casual and intimate setting, best if dinning outdoors, but inside was still enjoyable.
