Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Once we sat, it was 20 minutes to pizza, as they cooked it half way after we ordered it, and then the rest of the way once we were seated.  They looked rather wet, which disappointed us since we had ordered our pies well done.  But we started off on the classic and found a disk of sausage beneath the tomato and cheese layer - yes, that would keep the moisture from dissipating.  But we asked if the other pie could be run through the oven to dry it out some.
