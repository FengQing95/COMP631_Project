Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Not good. With a wait time that long, you would think the food was good...not true. Locals don't come here. It's a touristy food spot that somehow caught traction and got its shot to fame. I don't know why the reviews are good, maybe ppl don't know what a good deep dish pizza should taste like. Maybe tourists visiting Chicago have a low standard of what good food should taste like.
