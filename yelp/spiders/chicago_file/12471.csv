Art Institute of Chicago////Went on a Saturday morning when it opened to see the Obama portraits. The line to get in, even though we had purchased tickets online, was at least two blocks long. We decided to wait a bit, and went back in 45 minutes and were able to walk in. There is a virtual line to see the Obama portraits and even though it estimated it would be 45 minutes,  we got in in 30 minutes.  It was organized and you were not rushed through. Of course,  everyone wanted pictures and selfies, but overall,  everyone was reasonable. The art Institute has all types of art to view from modern to impressionists. Be prepared for lots of walking,and,and  lots of stairs. The cafes were still closed due to Covid, so there are no food or drink options.
