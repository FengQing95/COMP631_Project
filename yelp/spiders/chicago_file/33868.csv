Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For the mains I had the veal cheeks, where were very flavorful and tender.  Roasted veggies were perfect.  Hubby had the classic rib eye, medium rare, which was perfectly cooked and delish.  I noticed that other comments said their cut was fatty, but just to be clear rib eye is one of the fatty cuts of nicer steak, and I thought theirs was very lean in comparison to other ones we have had.  I also thought the flavor was great and I believe they are grass fed, which also leads to a leaner animal.  Also ordered a side of bone marrow, which, if you like bone marrow, is as good as it gets.
