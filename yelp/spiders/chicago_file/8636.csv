Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute is my one stop I must ALWAYS make when I visit Chicago. Religiously. I adore their permanent exhibitions, especially the Impressionists and the Modern Wing. Their special exhibits are constantly changing so check their website. This is not a place to visit for an hour or so. Plan on 3-4 hours to really enjoy the pieces then walk through the park to give your mind a while to digest it all, you will leave inspired.
