Smoque BBQ////Don't even look at the menu while standing in line (on the queue?) for food. Make sure your eyes are glossed and your saliva is viscous. Idle in the line until you order RIBS AND BEANS, then sit down (you get slaw, don't even ask). You will be seated next to the most obvious stereotypes. These people will be loud, well-scootered, and frothing about their jowls. Play the part.
