Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I stumbled upon this place when I first moved to Chicago and since then have dined here at least once every few months. With Chicago being such a big city, I try not to dine at restaurants more than one time. Cafe ba-ba-Reeba has a phenomenal atmosphere for both date nights or an evening out with your girlfriends. The bacon wrapped dates are out of this world and the classic red sangria is a must. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba can be anything from a place to grab a drink and a quick bite to a full blown friendsgiving event.
