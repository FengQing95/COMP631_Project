Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm reviewing this chain based off of its whole "ship nationwide!" thing. I'm sorry, but it makes zero sense. It costs just under $14 for a 9" pizza at the restaurant, but it costs ... ... ... THIRTY bucks to get the SAME thing delivered to your house. Please explain to me how this is a good value? The $14 for 9" in Chicago is fair, but under no circumstance is it okay or reasonable to charge as much as they do -- even if it includes shipping, which it does. For that reason alone, there's no way I can recommend ordering through the mail. It is the very epitome of a rip-off, and it's pretty much robbery.
