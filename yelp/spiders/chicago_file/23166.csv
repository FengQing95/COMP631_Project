Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So I lived in Chicago since 1990 and never stepped foot into this restaurant. First off, I am not a huge fan of pizza.. I know!! What!!! I recently had family members visit from overseas and they wanted to try traditional Chicago favorites. What better place to take them to then Lou Malnati's for the deep dish pizza. I read the reviews here on Yelp and I knew we were looking at over 1hr wait to be seated since they do not take reservations. After 1hr & 20 minutes, we finally got seated. I know! This better be the best pizza in the world.
