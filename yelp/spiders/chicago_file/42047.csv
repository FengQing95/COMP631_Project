Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I am in love with this place. The tapas are very reasonably priced. I called in for a reservation a month in advance and they were booked. So if you have an event, plan way, way ahead. Everything I've tried has been great. The bacon wrapped dates are surprisingly good. Sangrias are absolutely amazing. Get the potatoes! Great place for a group, parking sucks though.
