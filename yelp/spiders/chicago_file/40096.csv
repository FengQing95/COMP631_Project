Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////In Chicago, Bavette's for a good steak is a great choice.  The vibe of the place is classic steak house with brick walls.  The bread is amazing...so fresh with a great crust. The wedge salad is fantastic, and the steaks!!!!  Our server was very good.  If you can get a reservation, grab it.
