Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For the wait this place has, I was expecting to be blown away. I wasn't blown away but the pizza is super tasty. However, I could probably live off of pizza. We were given an estimated 1 hour wait so we grabbed a drink and hung out outside. There's barely any waiting room inside which seems silly to me for a restaurant that is almost always on a wait. We lucked out by waiting outside as their patio is first come first serve, something they didn't tell us at the host stand. You would think that would be the first thing they say, to hopefully keep the wait down. They do allow you to pre-order your pizza, since the deep dish pizzas take up to 45 minutes, which helps a lot. Our server was slammed but she was great and their bottles of wine are cheap. The spinach bread is a great appetizer and their regular size salads are huge! After an app and salad, my BF and I split a personal size pizza, advertised as for 1, and it was more than enough. It's definitely a Chicago staple and the food is good. But be prepared to wait, most likely in an overly crowded area.
