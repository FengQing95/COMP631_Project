Little Goat Diner////but that didn't show at Little Goat. I got the highly rated French Toast Chicken per yelp and our waiter's recommendation that "It will blow your mind". Well, it was pretty good. The egg was buried inside the french toast which was interesting. The fried chicken came in chopped up slices which was unexpected. Overall, a good dish, but it does not justify the $16 price tag. I felt like I was eating a fancy high quality McDonald's breakfast item. I'd rather go to Publican Quality Meat a block or two down the street.
