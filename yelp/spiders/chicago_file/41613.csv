Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////With of of this said, I do come back quite often. I love coming with friends because laughing, with a glass of great red wine in hand, beside a table of cheese makes for a perfect night.  Hopefully the chefs in back take a hint and ease up on the EVO and punch up the spices instead.  Anyway, great place to hang with friends and nibble but I'm still on the lookout for a better casual tapas spot.
