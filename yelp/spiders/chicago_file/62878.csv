Smoque BBQ////If you like BBQ, waiting in line and BYOB then this is your spot. I am not that big into BBQ, but my BF loves it so we decided to give it a try. For a Friday night, I expected it to be way more crowded, and luckily it wasnt. We waited the longest on getting sat at a table than we did waiting in line to order.
