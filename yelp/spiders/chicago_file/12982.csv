Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our friends told us about Lou Malnati's so we knew we had to check it out. We decided to order carry out since the wait was going to be over an hour long - even at 10pm. We ordered the "Malnati Chicago Classic" pizza based on their staff's recommendation. Needless to say, we were slightly disappointed by their pizza! It definitely wasn't the best we've ever had, but it wasn't bad either. It's just that we've had better deep dish pizzas elsewhere.
