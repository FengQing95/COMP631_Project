Little Goat Diner////A friend recommended this place for lunch on a recent visit to Chicago and I'm so glad he did. We made reservations for 9:30 on Saturday and it was already packed inside with people waiting. Our waiter was warm and friendly and explained the menu to us. Hubby ordered the fat Elvis and I got the apple pancakes. Both entrees were excellent. We also got yogurt and granola as a side and the yogurt was out of this world. It was so rich and creamy it tasted like ice cream. We had a lovely time here, definitely recommend and definitely items make a reservation.
