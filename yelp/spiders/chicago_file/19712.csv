Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The not so positive - The dough was very undercooked, so  each time I took a bite I was welcomed with gooey cold pizza dough.  Also, it seemed like my waiter disappeared after he took my order and he forgot my order of bread for the salad.  Overall, the pizza was just ok, but I think there are much better pizza places in Chi-Town.
