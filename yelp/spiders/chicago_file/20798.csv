Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Could we stop ourself not to come to this place two days in a row? Nop! Every bite of our pitzza was a ceremony in our mouth. The combination of cheese and layers of tomatoes and fresh basil was magnificent. Â And the crust? I can't find a word for it. Try this place! You won't regret it.
