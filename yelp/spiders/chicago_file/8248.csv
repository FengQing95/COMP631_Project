Art Institute of Chicago////You can't ever seem to spend enough time here!  I feel like I'm always here until closing.  Plus, I feel like if I looked at every single thing and read about it - it would still take me longer than a day.  You don't realize how big the museum is until you walk through the 2nd floor and look at all the paintings.  It's so amazing that the paintings you see are in real life and not on the internet, tv, or read in a book.  I only wish that there was a commentator to point out some of the things that I might have missed out on.  I have to say that the place really evokes my emotions, and that surprises me to some degree.  It makes me want to create art of my own!  I'm tempted to become a member, but wonder if I'll get a chance to go visit the museum that often.  If you are ever in Chicago for a visit, this place is a must see!
