Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After being seated, we ordered drinks and waited for our pizza that we had per-ordered.  When we got our pizza everything from the crust to the sausage on top was flavorless.  We had heard such good things about deep dish pizza and Chicago but this pie did not hold up to the hype.
