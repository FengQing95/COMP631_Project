Little Goat Diner////This used to be one of my favorite spots, but last night's dinner left a bad taste in my mouth. The bread on my veggie burger was burned, the waitress had to come to our table twice to tell my husband that 1) they were out of the dish he ordered and 2) they were out of the beer he ordered, and my kiddos were just not feeling their meals. The Mac and cheese was super rubbery, but the grilled cheese and fries were good. I will also say it's kind of crazy to charge $15 for a burger and a side isn't included in that.
