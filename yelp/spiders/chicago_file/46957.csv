Smoque BBQ////I went here for the first time the other night with a few friends.  For my sides, I ordered the sliced brisket with cornbread and mac & cheese.  The brisket had good flavor and was very tender, but it was by no means the best barbeque that I have ever had.  In fact, I felt that the best thing that I was served was my side of mac & cheese.  I didn't try any of the other types of barbeque which my friends had, so I don't know if I happened to order Smoque's least-extraordinary item.  I also thought that the portions were on the smaller-side.  Some of my friends ordered sandwiches, and I felt as though the amount of meat that they were served was comparable in size to my entrée.  It wasn't just my entrée that was small.  My sides of mac & cheese and cornbread were relatively small too.
