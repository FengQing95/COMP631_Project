Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I grew up in Chicago but have been away for the past 6 years so I had craving for good ol, reliable Malnati's but I was highly disappointed with the process. We arrived on a Wednesday evening about 7p. Granted it was dinner time so wait time was expected but we were told 30 minutes but we were not seated until about 90 minutes later. Also, Â we were instructed to order our food right away while we waited to be seated so that it could be ready when we're seated which makes sense but it was so long after we got seated that we started thinking it might not be fresh... Well when we finally sat down, the server explained that they had "started" cooking our pizza an hour ago, and now will "finish" cooking it for 25 minutes. This was a huge disappointment to say the least...When it finally arrived, you could tell that it was a bit dry, maybe the cooking and break in between impacts the flavor. The server was nice, all smiles despite the crazy crowd but would I frequent this place again? Probably not. Stick to Giordianos or Rosatis. They do it right.
