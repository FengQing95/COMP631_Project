The Purple Pig////3. Roasted bone marrow: this wasn't pretty good. Well.cooked.and spread on a perfecy toasted piece of bread topped off with a green citrousy salad that wiped the oiliness off. One of my friends can't really eat cilantro and this salad had some in it, which for me added a lot to the flavor palate. However if you can't eat the salad it may be a tad too oily for you.
