The Purple Pig////We got the daily special, which was sort of like a breakfast sandwich with a pork and truffle sausage - this was the best dish we had for lunch. The sausage was juicy and tender, and the truffle was subtle but present, not overpowering at all. I would order this again just for the sausage.
