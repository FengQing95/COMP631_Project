Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We usually make it to Chicago at least once a year and try to hit a steakhouse every time we go.  I have been wanting to try Bavettes for some time but usually wait too long to book a reservation but was able to get a seating and am very glad we did.  The whole experience was delightful.  The ambiance was great and the service top notch.  Our server recommended a great bottle of wine in our price range. (Am embarassed I forgot his name since he did a great job). I ordered the dry aged bone on ribeye with the mashed potatoes as a side.  The steak was cooked to perfection with a wonderful dry aged flavor.  My wife loved her steak as well but I doubt it could have tasted any better than mine.    You cannot go wrong here.
