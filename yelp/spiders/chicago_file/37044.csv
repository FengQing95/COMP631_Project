Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We settled on sharing the baked goat cheese, smoked trout caesar, roasted bone marrow, elote style corn and chocolate cream pie. Every dish was delicious!! The smoked trout caesar was probably the best caesar salad I've ever had. It was light and lemon-y and refreshingly good. The roasted bone marrow here is actually better than Au Cheval's. Why, you ask? It's served with a sweet onion jam which balances the heaviness of the marrow itself. A match made in heaven. The most surprising dish of the evening would have to be the chocolate cream pie though. It may not look like much but it's a party in your mouth. One of the best pies I've ever had, hands down. Next time I'm in the city and Au Cheval has its usual 3+ hour wait, I'm coming here with no looking back.
