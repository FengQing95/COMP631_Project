Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I came here with my boyfriend and we loved it. The atmosphere is dimly lit and perfectly 1920s without feeling like it was trying too hard. We sat and had cocktails until our table was ready and we both loved them. He's really into steak abd was excited to try the ribeye. His standards are high, but he loved it. It was cooked perfectly and the seasoning was delicious. I had the filet, which was also great, but I will admit I kept stealing bites of his. The mashed potatoes were also awesome. This is definitely the best food we've had in Chicago thus far and we'll defibetly be back.
