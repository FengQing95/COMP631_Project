Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////What an amazing dining experience! This is such a great place to celebrate a special occasion.  We went to Babette's for my husband's birthday on a Saturday night.  To start, we did not make a reservation but it was early in the evening.  We were seated immediately.  I was a little nervous because the table was right by the door and the waiting area.  That did not matter at all.  As soon as we sat down, I was impressed by the ambiance.  It was perfectly charming with low lighting and subtle jazz music that transported me back to the 20's or 30's.
