Smoque BBQ////I really can't add anything new to this, other than I would say it's the best brisket in city limits. I'll still drive down to the south side for a tips and links combo (sauce on the side, please), but the brisket here is spot on. The brisket chili is definitely my favourite side, hands down, with the coleslaw in a close second. The rest of the sides will just fill you up before you get to finish that delicious brisket, so don't bother.
