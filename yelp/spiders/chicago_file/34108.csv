Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We sat at the bar and both ordered the Cognac Sazerac as our first drink.  My 2nd was a mint julep and the bf's was the Bavette's punch.  Wow!  Was that good!  I really want to go back just for that.  Our waiter was very friendly and the drinks were perfectly made.  Strong and well worth the $13 price tag.  I sure had a nice rosy glow to my cheeks after the two drinks.  Since we came in around 1030pm we didn't have a chance to try any of the food.  But if the drinks and the fact that its the same owners as Au Cheval and Gilt Bar are any indication of how the food will be like.. then sign me up!  Whoa!.. does that..make me ... dare i say it .. a Brendan Sodikoff groupie?!  :: GASP ::  Well if it is then I shall wear my "S"odikoff Scarlett letter proudly!
