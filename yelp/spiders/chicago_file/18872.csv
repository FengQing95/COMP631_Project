Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////All were good, but its a challenge to eat three whole pieces. The butter crust is nice and the cheese is decent quality. Overall I did not like the sausage used on the Malnati Chicago Classic pizza, but I think its a personal preference at the end of the day. Drinks are average and the pricing is fair. Its a good place to visit if you're in the city and need to try a local favorite.
