Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They said the pizza takes about 30-40 min and that was spot on. We ordered 2 personal pizzas (Lou & classic) for two ppl but the genius bartender advised us to get a small, half and half. So dope. Didn't know you could do that! The Lou is better than the classic. Garlic galore, in a good way. Lots-o-cheese on both! Plus the crust was crispy and not soggy, even on the bottom. Eat quickly because the cheese gets tough after sitting too long.
