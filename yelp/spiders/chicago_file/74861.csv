Little Goat Diner////Pork Belly Pancake - there's a mountain of coleslaw like salad. DON'T WORRY. there's a GIGANTIC slab of PORK BELLY underneath. And the spring onion pancake lies beneath this all. Love the Pork Belly. and the salad was surprisingly tasty. AND, when you eat it as leftovers, it is EVEN MORE flavorful and marinated! SO GOOOOD.
