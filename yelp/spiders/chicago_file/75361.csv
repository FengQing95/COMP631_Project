Little Goat Diner////I came at 1156pm and was told by a friend that the kitchen closes at 12am. Not only did the waiter accommodate me, she was patient and provided me with a lot suggestions. I asked her about the mac & cheese. She said they make everything from scratch, even the pasta apparently. I'm a sucker for mac & cheese, so I ordered it and it came. It looked underwhelming and the first couple bites were just as mundane. But it began to get significantly more tasty. By the end of the bowl, the creaminess, the sharp cheeses, and the slight crunch of bread crumbs made this favorite.
