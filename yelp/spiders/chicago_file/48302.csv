Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love this place!!!! Their bacon wrapped dates are the best out of everywhere I tried! I didn't even know I liked dates until I had theirs! Love the sangria. Employees are always very nice and quick to service. They're patio area has awesome chill vibes. Definitely recommend this place 10/10. Never been disappointed with them.
