Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////It was a friend-of-a-friend's birthday dinner. I was super excited she picked this place because I kept hearing wonderful things but couldn't bring myself to go without a good reason. I know tapas places are notorious for charging an arm and leg, which is as un-Spanish as you can get considering that tapas are traditionally served like cheap popcorn or peanuts in dive bars.
