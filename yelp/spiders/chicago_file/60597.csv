Smoque BBQ////We were in town for the USC/Notre Dame game and decided to break our tradition of having pizza on the first night so we could try this legendary restaurant. And it was a little bit of a tough sell because from our hotel in downtown it looked like it was half way to O'Hare. But after the first few bites the consensus was that it was worth the $20 cab ride.
