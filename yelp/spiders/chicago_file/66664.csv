Little Goat Diner////Came on a Wednesday and were seated really quickly for brunch. Service was great and we ordered bulls eye pancakes which were amazing!! The egg was perfectly cooked in the center w the yoke oozing out! Highly recommended! We also got hashbrowns which were also good! Giving it 4 stars bc 5 is only reserved for the very best :)
