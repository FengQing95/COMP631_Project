Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The unexpected news: We were seated in the front part of the dining room in the corner long booth area. It was sort of like a sweetheart table, so we were kind of sitting kitty corner from one another...the table was really small, so if it were two average sized adults (I'm pretty much pint sized), there would've very little legroom. Also, we sort of felt like we were halfway the the tables on either side of us. Plus, one of the tables right next to us added another diner part way into our and their dinner, so that person ended up sitting right next to one of us... I'm all about communal dining when it's expected (e.g., The Purple Pig); but, for a place like Bavette--especially since we went there for a special occasion--it would've been nice to have the experience be a little more normal. We asked to be re-seated, though were on a bit of a time crunch so didn't want to wait it out until tables had paid their bills and left, etc. Just decided to go with it.
