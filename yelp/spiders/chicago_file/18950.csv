Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came from out of town, order at opening time. Â I don't know if this was normal for Lou's or Chicago deep dish in general since it was my first time trying it but I thought the crust was kind of gross like old almost stale pizza dough. I wondered if they pre make the dough and I got one from days before that sat in a fridge somewhere but it was bad. I was also disappointed with the amount of sauce, it was barely there very bland either very light handed on the spices or they didn't put any at all. It was a cheese deep dish so there was plenty of cheese, but again very bland no saltiness to it almost like a unsalted fresh mozzarella. The "deep" dish was not deep by any means and looking through the pictures here that seems the norm. I really wish I would have tried a mom n pop place as I feel Lou's has become just the popular place in Chicago for tourists while the better pizza places are left in the shadows known only by the locals. It was kind of lousy especially for the price $18 for a medium cheese which is about a 12 inch pie at their store. I almost never write a bad review especially after only one visit but I probably won't ever be in Chicago again and after 18 hours of driving and excitement to try this deep dish it was such a let down I had to write this.
