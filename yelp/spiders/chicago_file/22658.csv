Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We put our name down at 12:39. Preordered our pizza at 12:47. At 1:15 we got seated. At 2:05 we still didn't get the pizza.  Waiter didn't seem to care when asked to check on our pizza. So we walked out. Sorry Chicago, you may have good pizza, but what good is it if you can't even prepare it in time?
