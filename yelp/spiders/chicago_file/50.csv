Au Cheval////Yuuuum!  We've been here multiple times and we make sure to go on a week night.  We don't have the patience to wait for too long.  My fiancé and I, our favorite dishes are the duck hearts with hash, the mashed potatoes and gravy, the BURGER w/ a fried egg and bacon and my fiancé likes the bologna sandwhich.  Btw, the burger, is one of the best burgers in this city!  Seriously.  Their cocktails are quite yummy too.  This is a great upscale diner with a intimate feel.  The food is heavy though, so if you are looking for healthy options or light food, your options are limited and this may not be the place for you. It's a diner!  I gave it four stars because the wait staff isn't the best.  We've been at least 10 times and we've experienced service from both ends of the spectrum, from rude to accommodating.  This rating should be more like a 3.75, but since the food is so good (despite the inconsistent wait staff) I'll give it a 4 vs going down to a 3.
