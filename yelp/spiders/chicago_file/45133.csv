Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Blech. Went for brunch and tried several of the tapas dishes. Didn't want to finish any. Dry French toast, tasteless sliders, plus a really pushy waitress who tried several ways to get us to over order, then told us that they don't split bills and charged me twice for an overpriced cappuccino. Also very loud and cold.
