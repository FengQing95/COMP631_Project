Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is one of my favorite tapas places! I've only been there once but I already can't wait to go back. I had the baked goat cheese in tomato sauce, spicy potatoes with tomato alioli, and shrimp with garlic olive oil and red pepper flakes. Everything was so delicious, and the staff was very nice. The service was pretty quick even though the wait was long. I would definitely recommend going!
