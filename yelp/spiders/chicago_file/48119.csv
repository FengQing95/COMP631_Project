Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I thought the food was fine but nothing fantastic. My heart and stomach are not called back to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba. We had shrimp, scallops, bacon wrapped dates, and the spicy potatoes (probably the most memorable dish out of them all). Portion sizes were reasonable for the price, and the two of us were pretty stuffed with 4 dishes. Not a bad experience by any means but I would say this place is quite average. Not really much to write home about.
