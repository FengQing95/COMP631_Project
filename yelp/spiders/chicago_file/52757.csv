Smoque BBQ////The brisket I was a little disappointed with. It's my favorite BBQ food and theirs was somewhat dry and I didn't really taste the rub. The sauce for the brisket was very watery compared to the ribs sauce and I did not like that since it soaked into the bread very quickly and didn't stick to the meat as much as I would have liked.
