Smoque BBQ////I love this place, been going here for about two years now. The first time we went there the line was out the door and around the corner, literally. So I said heck no and went somewhere else. Big Mistake, the ribs we had at the second joint were terrible. On a followup visit, made sure to get there earlier. There still was a line but it moves well and if you're eating in, they really do an excellent job of finding a table for your party by the time you've placed your order. Â I didn't think the family style seating was for me, but I quickly got over it just knowing we didn't have to scramble to find a seat that's so cool. And there was the food. The baby backs are excellent, never tough or drowning in sauce, it's served on the side, they're seasoned well and have the right amount of pink on the inside. The slaw is excellent, not that store bought crap that's been made days in advance and swimming in mayo. The BBQ beans, Mac and Cheese, Bag of cut fries, and cobbler. OMG, talk about having to loosen your belt. My only wish is they were closer to my house. Oh hell, that's what I-GO car is for when I don't have a ride. You can even call ahead for pickup orders and they tell you exactly when the order will be ready. How sweet is that.
