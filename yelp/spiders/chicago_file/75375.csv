Little Goat Diner////We stopped here for breakfast on our trip to Chicago. We were able to make a reservation online that morning, and were seated right away when we got there. Everything on the menu sounded great but we got the omelette of the day (mushrooms and cream cheese), pork belly home fries, and the Little Piggy Goes to China. All super flavorful and cooked perfectly. The restaurant itself is very comfortable with lots of room to move around. Also lots of natural light which I appreciated. Very cute brunch spot! If we lived in Chicago we'd be regulars.
