Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love Ba-Ba-Reeba, especially if I am with a group.  It is a little loud in the restaurant, but that adds to the festive ambiance.  I have consistently loved and have never been disappointed in the service or the food.  The sangria is top notch and they have many variates.  This was were I wanted to go for my bachelorette party and it was a blast.  It is in a neighborhood where there is enough to do after dinner as well.  But you can make Ba-Ba-Reeba an all night affair.  I would recommend a reservation on weekends, otherwise you may have to wait, but no fear, there is a great bar.
