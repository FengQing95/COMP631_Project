Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza was definitely worth the wait.  It was delicious!   I had one slice and it was just right. I wasn't stuffed like the last time I came.  Last time, I had the Malnati Chicago Classic so the pizza was caked in sauce and cheese which was heavy and overwhelming, but this one was just right so I highly recommend ordering the Sausage Deep Dish.
