The Purple Pig////The restaurant itself is cute. Has a lively cafe type of vibe. I didn't watch much of the action in the open kitchen as we were seated in one of the tables along the wall, but I can imagine it being entertaining if you were seated at the bar. Our server was nice and attentive. Recommended the glass of bubbly for me.
