Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////. But surprisingly, this deep dish pizza wasn't amazingly great to me. It was good, but not that great. The cheese on the pizza was the best part though. It was cheesy and gooey. The honey BBQ wings were the best. I wish we could've had ordered more of that. The salad was also good. The service was great, except the part where my bf asked for a side of ranch dip for the pizza, it never came to our table until we asked again. The waiter thought my bf wanted the marinara sauce.....I wonder how the waiter mistaken ranch dip with marinara sauce?? Â But overall, everything was great and we enjoyed our first meal in ChiTown.
