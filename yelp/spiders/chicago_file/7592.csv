Art Institute of Chicago////When you step closer, it only gets better. That's when you notice that in one afternoon you can traverse a century of some of the most important art work the would has yet seen.   Whether the subject be a sacred figure, a serene vista, a surrealist vision or yes, even Sunday on La Grande Jatte, you'll find it at the AIC, presented in a respectful and accessible manner.
