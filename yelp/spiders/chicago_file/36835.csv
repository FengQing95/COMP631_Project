Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Classy place. Nice place to grab drinks and date night. Friday night, wait hour for table is about 1 1/2-2hours. We got a table at a bar. Very nice bartender served us with wisdom. Their portion is really generous. One dish will fill you up all the way but since all of their menu are good. You can order half salad, one bone marrow instead full dishes. Love the shaved beef sandwich. Wedge salad. Bone marrow is the must dish. Like their light drink menus. There is a very wise Asian female bartender. She is good!
