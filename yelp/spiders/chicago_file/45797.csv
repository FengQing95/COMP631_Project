Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great for groups.  I'd definitely recommend reservations; every time I go, it seems to be busy and lively.  The service isn't always that great but I've always had a good time and thought that the tapas were tasty.  Some of my favorites: spicy potatoes, beef empanadas, mixed combo paella.
