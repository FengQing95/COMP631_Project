Little Goat Diner////My wife was in more of a lunch mood and ordered one of the sammiches, the Les Drowned: Braised beef with avocado, pickles, onion and spicy mayo served on a hoagie with jus for dipping. The portion was quite large and my wife (who has a hearty appetite) brought home half the sammich for later (if I do not get to it first; I snagged a couple of bites while at the diner and it was outstanding - the braised beef was literally bursting with flavor and the bread and fixings were fresh and delicious as well). She also ordered the smoked fries which were OK, but unlike the entrees nothing special and probably not worth the $5 surcharge. Â Beverage wise we opted for coffee which also was quite drinkable, but as with the fries nothing special; the staff did a great job keeping our mugs topped off throughout the meal. Also available are some interesting sounding house sodas, juices and teas but no adult beverages served.
