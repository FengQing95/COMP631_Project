Little Goat Diner////When I couldn't decide between a few things, our server strongly encouraged me to get the pork belly atop a green onion pancake with this crazy delicious slaw. And I hate slaw. I made zero modifications, and nervously awaited my food. Ordering this was legitimately one of the best ideas ever. It was so very delectable! I want to go back and try more things, but I don't know that I can not order this when it's right freaking there.
