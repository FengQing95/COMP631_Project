Little Goat Diner////Affiliated with Girl and the Goat, we felt that Little Goat would be worth checking out for brunch. We waited less than an hour for a table for 3 on a Friday morning (and it wasn't even a holiday!). There is a Starbucks just down the street if you're looking for a boost before the meal.
