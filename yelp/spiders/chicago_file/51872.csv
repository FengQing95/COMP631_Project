Smoque BBQ////I'm from Texas and have spent my fair share of time in Memphis as well. I can say that this place is legit. They have great dry rub ribs and moist brisket. The sides were every bit as impressive as the BBQ itself. I had the BBQ beans, which are a meal in themself, and the mac and cheese - both were awesome. I went in a large group of people and heard the same impressive feedback on the peach cobbler. Try Smoque, you will not be disappointed.
