Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I've been there several times, and it's okay. The biscuits and gravy are the best thing I've had- lots of sage, lots of flavor. I think the biggest problem is the syrup is of poor quality, and it downplays the pancakes. I'd choose to go 10 minutes up the street to the original pancake house, over coming here any day. Get there early, before 8, for no line.
