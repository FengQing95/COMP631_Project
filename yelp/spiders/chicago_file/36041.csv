Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////2) We ordered the baked goat cheese, dry-aged rib eye, mashed potatoes, and brussel sprouts. Let me talk about the baked goat cheese first. The baked goat cheese came out about 25 minutes after we were seated, so not super quick but not super slow either. It tasted great! Perfect balance of the rich goat cheese and the tangy tomato sauce that all paired well with the garlic bread. We were very excited for what was to come after tasting the baked goat cheese.
