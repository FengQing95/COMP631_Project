Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I am 100% OBSESSED with this restaurant. I am not one to go to the same place again and again unless I find it exquisite, which I do. First let me start with how you need to go on a day that they serve brunch. I can't go to ba ba eeba and not get one or two deviled eggs with crispy jamon serrano. They are out of this world!!! Second, do yourself a favor and get the passion fruit sangria. Amazing. You really can not go wrong with any of the tapas. If it is your first time I recommend getting the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, but again every tapa I have ordered I have thoroughly enjoyed.
