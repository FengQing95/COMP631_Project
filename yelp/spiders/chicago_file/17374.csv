Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've never been a deep dish fan.  For a long time I only wanted Stuffed from Giordano's.  I then evolved into a Home Run Inn guy; their frozen Ultra Thin is fantastic.  Lately I've tried Malnati's Deep Dish.  It is wonderful pizza.   And their lunch specials are a great deal.  Individual pizza, a very large salad, and a drink with free refills for $11.
