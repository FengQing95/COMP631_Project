Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This is our go to pizza place near where we live. We always get a half sausage half mushroom thin crust. It is consistently done well. The crust is flakey and buttery. The sauce is tangy and seasoned well. It's also not too liquify. It's a good consistency for pizza sauce. I wouldn't call it a true thin crust. It more like a tavern style but compared to the deep dish it's definitely thin.
