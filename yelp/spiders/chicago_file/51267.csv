Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We went with some friends for restaurant week and ordered every item on that tasting menu between the 4 of us! Everything was super tasty. The shrimp and grits were my favorite. Their Bloody Mary bar was awesome too because they had gazpacho as an option for your mixer! How cool is that?? This place is HUGE too! Our waiter was absolutely excellent. Overall a fantastic brunch experience.
