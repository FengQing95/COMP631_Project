Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food was pretty good, but it was served with dirty plates and silverware!  Our waitress was understanding when I sent back a stack of plates, but then even some of the replacements had stuck-on food (and most were wet- gross).  Same with the silverware.  There are plenty of other tapas restaurants that take a little more pride in their presentation and cleanliness.  I won't be back.
