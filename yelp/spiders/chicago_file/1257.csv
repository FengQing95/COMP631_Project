Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Thankfully, the service was excellent. My waitress was super nice; maybe she could tell I'd had a bad morning...damn train. The place was pretty empty but two of the customers around me were a pain in the a**. One old lady sent her pancakes back because she didn't like the taste (you ordered them, you eat them!), and this you-know-what woman sitting next to me made sure to tell her waitress that the extra $0.50 charge on her bill for a side of cream cheese should be added to the menu or future customers should be forewarned. Listen, I'm about as cheap as it gets, but 50 cents? Please, worry about more important things in life.
