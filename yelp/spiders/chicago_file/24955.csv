Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered the Malnati classic personal pizza, and for some reason what I got that day was not what I was expecting. The tomato sauce did not taste fresh, and the cheese wasn't exactly tantalizing either. The crust was crispy at least, but when the tomato/cheese/sausage are all subpar at best, I can only give two stars. I can't explain why it really just tasted as if the pizza ingredients all came from a can as I've had amazing pizza experiences at other locations in other parts of the city.
