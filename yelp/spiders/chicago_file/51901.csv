Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Bonus points for service... our most recent trip was to celebrate my fiance's birthday.  I merely left a simple note stating as such in our Open Table reservation and you would have thought my lady was a visiting dignitary from the service we received.  Our wonderful server-dude (gah I forget his name!) brought us out free pintxos to start the meal and a complimentary dessert platter with candle at the end.  I was blown away and very grateful for these thoughtful touches.
