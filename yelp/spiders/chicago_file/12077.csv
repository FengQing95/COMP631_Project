Art Institute of Chicago////We spent ~3 hours in here and ended up skipping a few sections of the museum as we realized we were running out of time. I did get to see all of the exhibits that I was most interested in, but for a really thorough exploration of the museum, you could stay here for the entire day! So much to see.
