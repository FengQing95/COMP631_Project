Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////There are these pork ribs that are some of the best I've ever had! They satisfy all of rib criteria: crispy shell WITH a glaze + a true fall-off-the-bone texture. These really dont need any tooth effort for separation. Someone could pass gas in your general direction and the force of that small current of pleasant air could send the meat FLYING off these bad boys.
