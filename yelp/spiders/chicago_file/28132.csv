Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Well, we went on a Saturday night around 8:30 pm with no reservation. So, yes there was a wait, but I really appreciated being able to place our order when we got there so it could start cooking while we waited for our table. We did wait, a long time, and it was super busy while we were eating, but the manager KATIE WENT WAY ABOVE AND BEYOND to make sure we were happy and satisfied, and she was an all-around pleasure to speak with as well.
