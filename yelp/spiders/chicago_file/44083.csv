Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My first tapas experience was at Ba Ba Reeba, and it's been the best I've found in Chicago so far. I've made reservations every time I've gone, and we've always gotten in a little early. If you plan on walking in, however, be aware that the place is pretty consistently packed. On weekends, you probably don't have a prayer to get in in under an hour. Waitstaff is quite friendly, though the hostesses are sometimes a bit snooty, and the place is always loud and boisterous without being too irritating.
