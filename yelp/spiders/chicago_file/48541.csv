Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been here on several occasions both on a date and group settings. This is an awesome venue for group outings where everyone dresses nicely and gets a little rowdy. However, please be advised that if you have a large group you have to plan very far in advance. I was totally bummed out when I couldn't reserve a table on my 24th birthday a couple of years ago and thought for sure I'd be able to get in with almost two weeks notice, but alas it's a super busy place and we ended up at a different venue. Â So if you're planning a large group outing, plan waaayyyy in advance!
