Little Goat Diner////Food:  Food was EXCELLENT.  Tried 3 dishes between the two of us. Los Drowned - the braised beef sandwich was awesome. Beef very tender. Peppers and onions added great texture and dipping sauce was right on point.  The Bull's Eye French Toast was out of this world. Egg baked into the middle of the french toast. Sauce was not too sweet but also a bit fruity/acidic at the same time. Loved the crispy chicken on top - cooked to perfection.  The pork belly pancake was also very good though I think the other two were better for my taste. Not that the pancake wasn't good. It was great but the other two for me offered more.
