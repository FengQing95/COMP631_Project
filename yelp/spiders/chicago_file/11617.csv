Art Institute of Chicago////To be honest, I'm not a big museum person, but we bought a Citypass and my friend wanted to check out the art institute. I have been before but probably not since 2009 or 2010. With the city pass you also get an audio guide gadget which was fun, you walk up to a piece that has a number on it and can type in that number on the gadget and listen to some commentary about it. I liked this much more than just walking up to the piece and reading about it. We only had about an hour or two between engagements, and we probably could've spent more time here. If you are not an Illinois resident, it will cost you about $25 to get in here ... The best time to go if you are a resident is on Thursdays because I believe it's free for residents that day.
