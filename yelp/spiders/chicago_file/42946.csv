Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Definitely save room for dessert. Upon mention of the occasion, our birthday girl was given a coconut flan and a toffee caramel bar. The flan was denser than any I'd had before, very smooth, and not too sweet. I loved the subtle coconut flavor. Two of the people I was with said the toffee bar was too sweet for them, but I thought its lightness balanced out its sweetness pretty well. The apple empanada was soft and warm and pillowy, and the mango sorbet was good enough to thoroughly enjoy during below-freezing temperatures.
