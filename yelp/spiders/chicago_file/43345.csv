Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ew....What happened to this place?!?!?! Â I've been coming here for years and had to stop for awhile because it was so nasty!!!! The food was coming within 3 minutes of ordering, it was not at all fresh and nothing tasted the same. I know it's really popular, but I still like to think my food is cooked to order, not ready to go like McDonald's.
