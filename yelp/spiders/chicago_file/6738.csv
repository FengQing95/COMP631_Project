The Purple Pig////The only disappointment was the latte, I think their espresso did not have a good quality, and therefore the coffee tasted badly. I guess people can't expect too much from a cup of dessert coffee that only costs $5, but if a restaurant like this has anything on the menu, they should consider about the quality .
