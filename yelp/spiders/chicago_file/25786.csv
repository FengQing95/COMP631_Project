Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I had dinner at Lou Malnati's Pizza on my first night in Chicago. I ordered a House Salad with their House Red Wine Viniagrette Dressing and the "Lou." It was EXCELLENT! The Deep Dish pizza was tasty, though it does take a while for them to cook it. The salad was alright, I had to ask for extra dressing because there was barely any on there. They also ask you to prepare for at least a 45 minute wait. The sever was attentive. Overall, I would definitely go back and I would absolutely recommend Lou Malnati's to anyone that wants authentic Chicago style deep dish pizza.
