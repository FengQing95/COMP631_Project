Art Institute of Chicago////A truly world-class art museum, and membership is an amazing deal for any student spending time in Chicago. A few hours let you speed through the "highlights," but I'm looking forward to more trips and quality time in pre-impressionist Europe, Asia, and seeing decorative arts.
