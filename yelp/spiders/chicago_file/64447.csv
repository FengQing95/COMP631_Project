Smoque BBQ////We came back for a lunch with the son and a couple of his college pals.  It was a first visit for them, and I think they would all agree with the rating -  at least they ate like they would agree.  The beef brisket was the usual unbelievably awesome good.  The ribs this time (half slab of each St Louis and baby back) were also more moist and better than we've had from here in the past.   We all liked the St Louis ribs better.  No waiting at 1pm on this weekday, but the queue to door would come and go sporadically.  As usual, the attendants found a spot for 5 of us with no trouble.  They seem to be able to do it no matter how crowded the place appears.  It's reaffirmed again - Smoque really is as good as it gets!
