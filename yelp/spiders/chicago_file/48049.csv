Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My bestie and I came here for a brunch outing. This turned out to be the perfect place. They didn't have any mimosas or Bellinis but they had a Bloody Mary bar and amazing sangria. I tried the blackberry sangria (or maybe it was black raspberry), it was refreshing and not too sweet and was made with real fruit, not syrup! We tried the vegetable eggs Benedict with patatas bravas, the berry buttermilk waffles, and the bacon Mac n cheese. Everything was outstanding. I'd highly recommend this place!
