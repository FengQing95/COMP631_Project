Little Goat Diner////The okonomiyaki, on the other hand, was a miss.  Traditional okonomiyaki consists of many ingredients inside and on top.  The Little Goat version lacked many of these ingredients, which made it a lot less substantial. Not to mention it was on the dry side.  I think Little Goat Diner is a good breakfast and brunch spot, but the okonomiyaki won't be on my list next time.
