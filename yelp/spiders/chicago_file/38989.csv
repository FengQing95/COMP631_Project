Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Since I was dining solo I only nibbled on a corner of the bread but oh my god, that was perfect too. Cultured butter. Warm, crusty, chewy bread. I am not much of a wine drinker, but the malbec was such a good choice. It complimented the meat so well. The corn- wow. Creamy, a slight chew, with the perfect amount of acidity. I can't really compare it to anything else because I haven't had anything quite like it. I think it was supposed to mirror elote loco? (I haven't had it yet).
