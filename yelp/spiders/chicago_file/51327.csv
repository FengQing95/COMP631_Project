Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Back in the mid to late 2000s, I used to come here and spend a lot of money on not a lot of food (although delicious).  Fast forward almost 10 years, and nothing has changed.  The plates are so small and light, you need to handle them with delicate hands.  If you've got the shakes, your food will go flying off your plate.  You've been warned!
