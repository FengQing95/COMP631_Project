Little Goat Diner////I have had paraths burrito, spanish omlette and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes and all of the them taste amazing. The egg in the paraths burrito is always perfectly cooked, the salad and the sauce to go with it taste amazing. Its just the perfect texture with the creamy sunny side up egg, cruncy salad, little bit of paratha with a bite and the tangy sauce... perfect bite! The spanish omlette was amazing too, and the chocolate chip pancakes - very rich, chocolate perfectly dark, pancakes just sweet to contrast the dark chocolate and those little chocolate pearls add some crunch to the bite.
