Little Goat Diner////This place has a fun atmosphere and the service was really wonderful. When we arrived there was a (relatively short) half hour wait, we were given menus while we waited, and received a text when our table was ready. Our server was very attentive & friendly throughout the meal. However, I felt the food just wasn't as great as I expected it would be. It was fine, don't get me wrong. The burger was okay but a bit undercooked... we could've asked to have it cooked further & I'm sure the staff would have been more than happy to accommodate us, we just didn't. And I wasn't a fan of the smoked fries; maybe they are an acquired taste. The hash browns and club sandwich were fine. Overall, if you're a fan of diner food especially this place is probably worth trying, even if it's just for the ambiance.
