The Purple Pig////Because it was a late lunch in the middle of the work week, there was no wait. Whew! I totally expected at least a 30 minute line. The four of us were seated at the high top communal table on the outdoor patio. Gorgeous Chicago weather, and perfect for hanging out on the patio, especially since it was covered.
