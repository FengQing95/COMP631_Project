Little Goat Diner////Bullseye French toast: what chicken and waffles should be. Soft, wonderful French toast with an egg in the middle. You cut into it, bright beautiful yolk creeps out onto the plate. After cutting a piece with egg, stabbing a strawberry and piece of chicken onto your fork and shoving it all into your mouth, you dance in your seat from all the complimentary flavors in your mouth and the crunch of the chicken but sweet and saltiness of the strawberry and egg. Really phenomenal dish. My boyfriend and I split it because we were told it was a lot, and that was the best decision we made all day.
