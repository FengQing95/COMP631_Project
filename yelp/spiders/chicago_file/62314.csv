Smoque BBQ////I loved the BBQ sauce as well, tangy and meshed well with the meat. Damn. I could swim in that sauce. The sides we ordered were the Mac & Cheese, Peach Cobbler, Coleslaw, and the Corn Bread. Where do I even start? The smalls were a bit too small, it's meant for one person but we ordered a lot of sides to share. I really enjoyed the Coleslaw because it wasn't your traditional Coleslaw - it's not made with mayo at all, instead it is made with a vinaigrette which helps to lighten up and balance the meal and the rest of the more heavier sides. Even the Mac & Chese wasn't that heavy though, just the right amount of cheese, not too much. No complaints about the Corn Bread. And lastly, the Peach Cobbler was the perfect ending to our meal. I don't even know how to describe it other than I've never had Peach Cobbler like that before.
