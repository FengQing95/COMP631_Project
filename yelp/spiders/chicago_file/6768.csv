Art Institute of Chicago////And can I just say, I'm happy to recommend this world-class art museum to any and all comers.  The meticulous attention to display in this museum rivals (and IMO exceeds) that of many of the most famous art museums in the world.  The collection is unparalleled, the special exhibits are exceptional, the programming is remarkable (AM yoga amidst the art?  Whoa.)   While the price of one-time admission may seem prohibitive, grit your teeth and spring for it.  You will be happy you did the minute you get inside.  And if you're a local, consider membership, especially if you live/work downtown.   There's nothing like having a world-class museum as your study/lounge/meditational hall/refuge, and as another reviewer mentioned, it gives you visiting privileges to your favorites - hello, Tadao Ando gallery! - whenever you want them, as well as the time to space your viewing out between visits.  That way you can linger in the medieval galleries one time, the Asian galleries another, and the new modern wing yet another.
