Smoque BBQ////The sauce at Smoque deserves its own paragraph, because barbecue sauce is the reason that I don't (or didn't) really like barbecue. Typically the sauce is too sweet or tastes like ketchup and I just think it's icky. However, the sauce at Smoque was tangy and peppery with a little bit of spicy heat. It was perfect. I wanted to drink it.
