Art Institute of Chicago////Art Institute of Chicago, simply beautiful. It is definitely expensive even as a Illinois Resident, but it is well worth it. If you are a student like myself, have your school ID with you so you can bump down the price of the ticket. Also, wear comfortable shoes because there is a TON of walking.
