The Purple Pig////Due to the touristy location I wasn't expecting to be blown away by this meal but I was. We ordered everything to be shared: raviollo, cauliflower, feta dip, and salmon. Â I wasn't a fan of the cauliflower dish for more then a bite or two but everything else was delicious. The Raviollo dish was hands down the best thing I ate in 2021 and would consider a quick trip to Chicago just to eat that again.
