The Purple Pig////It is a super fun date spot too because a lot of the portions/appetizers are perfect for sharing, meaning you can try a lot of new things together. It is also conveniently located in the heart of downtown, making it a fun place for dinner before a night of drinks. All in all, just amazing. Words were lost my first time going, and they still are! I now fully understand why it is on the Michelin guide.
