Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visiting from Boston and Lou Malnati's was recommended me by the hotel to be the best Chicago deep dish pizza, so I just had to go.  The wait for a table was less than 10 minutes and I sat outside.  The waitress was just awesome- very pleasant, great service, and I was really happy.  I ordered a small pizza for myself, which I thought i could handle, but it was actually too big!  Next time, I'd get the individual.  Delicious pizza and a great experience all around.
