Little Goat Diner////Atmosphere - You see the words Diner on its windows, but the Little Goat feels like a nice upscale restaurant.  But what you'll find is they've woven the diner theme all throughout the restaurant.  Look around and you'll see classic round barstools, tables with metal trim, plenty of booth space, and plenty of coffee cups.  It's a great concept that fits the breakfast all day theme perfectly.  1 Star.
