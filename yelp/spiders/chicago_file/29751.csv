Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Chocolate Chip Pizza, Individual Serving, $3.35 prior to tax- Not that I had much room for dessert, but I still wanted something sweet to end this meal. So my husband and I opted to share an individual serving. This serving really is perfect for 1 person (or 2 full people). The cookie and ice cream was a good match and would love to order the larger serving ($6.65 prior to tax, serves 2-3 people). By the way, if you want to order this dessert, let your server know ahead of time because it does take some time to make.
