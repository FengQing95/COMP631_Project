Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As a native New Yorker, you'd think I'd write a scathing, biased review. Guess again..though my preference is foldable my slice vs. a Chicago deep dish, food here was enjoyable. Service is courteous and tentative. My complaints were 1) too much going on with only two toppings (pepperoni and basil) and 2.) The amount of salt used in the marinara. It was overbearing. The consistency of the cheese was on point. I almost felt like a kid again playing with my food
