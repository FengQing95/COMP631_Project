Smoque BBQ////This had got to be one of the best kept secret's in Chicago. The ribs are terrific but the brisket of beef is to die for!  Our first visit yesterday and believe me we are already talking about our next trip back. We live on the Gold Coast and it is 123 on the expressway or LSD (OK assuming there's no traffic! ) but I'm telling you this is a real find. If you are looking for fancy, forgetaboutit!  This is neighborhood dining or great takeout with large portions, friendly staff and the best BBQ around.  Don't just take  my word and get over this place get's discovered and you can't get in the door!!!
