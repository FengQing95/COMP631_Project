Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////However, the total wait time was ONE AND A HALF HOURS from putting our name on the list to having pizza in front of us. Yes it is the most amazing deep dish pizza ever but I kind of think no food is worth that kind of wait so that is why I docked one point. I asked if it was an unusually busy night and they said it's always like this. I'd probably go back when I'm in Chicago next, but may be for a weekday lunch not Friday night dinner.
