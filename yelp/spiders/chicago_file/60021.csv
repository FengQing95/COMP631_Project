Smoque BBQ////That said, the ribs from Smoque are what I would describe as SOLID.  They were perfectly done and delicious.  Not very saucy, not particularly flavorful - the menu suggested St. Louis for the "authentic experience," but they were out and we got baby back.  It's a little pricey for what you get, and they charge extra for bread. It didn't capture my heart the way Uncle John's has, but it's close to my apartment, and no one in the neighborhood looks at me and assumes I'm there to buy drugs. It's not a friendly neighborhood joint  - the young lady who took my order didn't even look at me and none of the customers chat in line, but they were perfectly courteous.
