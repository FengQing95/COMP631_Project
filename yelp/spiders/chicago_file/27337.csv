Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Almost a 5. They were slammed so maybe the pizza sat for a little bit before it came out. But take a grain of salt with this review. I am a certified pizza snob from Chicago so I expect greatness. The pizza could have been a bit more juicy and fresh, imho. Great service and awesome crowd, cause...its CHICAGO!
