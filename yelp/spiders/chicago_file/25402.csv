Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Fresh ingredients on this deep dish!   This restaurant was recommended by a Chicago friend and it did not disappoint!  We ordered the sausage pizza and added more garlic, basil and tomatoes (not sundried). Delicious!  We had tried another local Chicago deep dish pizzeria and there is no comparison!  Lou Malnati's is a must for deep dish.  Be prepared to wait. TIP: They'll let you in advance,prior to getting your table, so your pizza will be baking while you wait!
