Art Institute of Chicago////On my last visit, one of the security guards was really mean when I accidentally took a picture of a piece of art I wasn't supposed to. It was my bad because I didn't see the small sign underneath the description and he was accusatory about it saying I did it on purpose. I deleted it to make him feel better (but I don't think he did). Usually at museums when that happens, they kindly remind you that pictures aren't allowed. It was a special exhibit though and when I asked him more about it, he said there were three paintings in the exhibit you couldn't take photos of but everything else you could. That could have been made more clear because usually you can take photos or you can't in an exhibit but it was mixed. I wonder if it was because it was an offensive painting but I will never know.
