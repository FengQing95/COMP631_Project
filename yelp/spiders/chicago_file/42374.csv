Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have a love/hate relationship with CBBR.  I love that its Lettuce so you know that the service is going to be great, which it is.  There are some definite stars, but the misses are big ones.  For example the simple things like olives are yummy.  The Spanish tortilla egg & potato dish is great.  The toasted bread with the tomato is simple and amazing.  The spicy potatoes with aioli is warm, toasty and yummy.  But then my boyfriend had the beef skewers and some of it was so tough that he couldn't chew it.  Other pieces were fine.  The sangria is just ok.  It seems like the pieces of apple are an afterthought and I know they don't use high quality wine for it, but it seems a little Boone's Farm-ish to me.
