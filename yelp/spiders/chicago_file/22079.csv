Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I came by Lou Malnati's on a Monday night in hopes of a quick bite. Unfortunately, the place was full, but I was determined to try my first deep-dish pizza. When I came back a few days later, I was able to get food and was pleasantly surprised. The pie wasn't as heavy as I had anticipated but was just enough to satisfy me. The tomato sauce and cheese were well balanced and didn't overwhelm the thick crust.
