Little Goat Diner////Yum!! Such an amazing veggie burger. I know its weird for me to write a review of a place that is known for being a diner and known for pork, but the veggie burger was delicious!! The fried pickles were amazing too!! I am sure if you love pork you will love this place, but I am also sure if you hate pork you will too! OINK!
