Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This was my first time here and overall this place succeeds with tapas. I was part of a large group for a friend's birthday and we ordered a ton of food. Some plates that I enjoyed included: grilled skewer of marinated pork belly and pork loin, beef tenderloin and blue cheese, grilled hangar steak with mojo picon, spicy potatoes with tomato alioli, goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, roasted dates with bacon and apple vinaigrette, garlic potato salad, catalan bread with ripe tomato and the chef's artisanal cheese selection. I was quite full after sampling everything mentioned above. The white peach sangria washed everything down quite nicely.
