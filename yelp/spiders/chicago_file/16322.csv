Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I guess it is true when people say, " It is all about the deep dish in Chicago". The deep dish pizza was one of many reasons why we decided to visit the Windy City. Once again, because of Yelp and the Food Network; hubby did some research and decided Lou Malnati's is the place to go for deep dish. He compared several main ones around the Chicago area and decided Lou Malnati's was the one we needed to eat at.
