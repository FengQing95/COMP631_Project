Little Goat Diner////Almost a year later and the place was packed on this Sunday morning! What a great sign! Waiting for a table was definitely worth it. I started off with a goat milk latte which was good, the coffee bar in the adjacent room really makes you want to give away Starbucks forever. I also had the smoked pork and toffee milkshake which was amazing. For breakfast I ordered the Fat Elvis Waffles and they were extremely good, especially the peanut butter-butter, I also had some of the French toast with chicken and that was pretty good as well although very different, and it caught me by surprise with all of the different tastes I got from one bite. My favorite however without any doubt were the smoked maple sausage links! They were so smokey and delicious, I could go there just for that day to day. Best sausage I've ever had.
