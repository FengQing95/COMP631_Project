Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The tapas were good, not knock your socks off, but good. I'm a particular fan of the garlic potato salad, the cheese plate and the beef with caramelized onions. My last time there I ordered the paella and had to give it big thumbs down...my first time having paella was in Valencia, so I'm likely really over-spoiled in this instance. The rice was mushy and it was extremely oily.
