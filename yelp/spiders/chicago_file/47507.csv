Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went in on a very busy Sunday evening. Place was full and we were seated in back. I was a little worried that we would get forgotten back there but I was wrong about that. Unlike the last time, our waiter was outstanding. Wish I remembered his name. Tall skinny white guy. He never left us too long but didn't over do it either. The bus boys were on it too: Waters always full and plates always quickly cleaned. Full water is something I am soooooo picky about.
