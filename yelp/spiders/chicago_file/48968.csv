Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Luckily I got a free redemption of stuffed mushrooms on my FB check in or else we would of still been hungry! The stuffed mushrooms and short ribs were very good. The scallops with concus and chicken empanada were okay. The shrimp and scallop paella wasn't good. It had some slimy tangy, extremely salty mixture with huge peapods and not enough shrimp or scallops. Bleh.
