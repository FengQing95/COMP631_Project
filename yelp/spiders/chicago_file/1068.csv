Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////We went on a Satruday in June -- Hint -- go early.  We arrived around 9 am and were proptly seated.  When we left the line was aroung the block!  Def try one of the sizziling skillets!  The eggs, hashbrowns and toppings are cooked excellently.  Service was prompt, bright and cheery.  Pancakes were good.  Note that the fruit ones are served with a fruit sauce -- fruit isn't cooked in the batter.  But they were tasty!
