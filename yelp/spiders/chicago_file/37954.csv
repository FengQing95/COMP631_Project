Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Double Bone Berkshire Pork Chop: served with herb jus and lemon.  This was my sister's entrée.  She really enjoyed everything about this pork chop.  She stated that it was really tender and juicy.  The herb jus and lemon was the perfect topping to enhance the natural flavors of the pork.
