Smoque BBQ////Pulled pork itself was fine, but the sauce? Weird, thin, and way too tomato-based which I guess is "another kind of bbq" as opposed to what I'm used to (I don't pay enough attention to the bbq Nazi shows on Food Network where people argue about what's "right" about bbq sauce). Cole slaw wasn't bad.
