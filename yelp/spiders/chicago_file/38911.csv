Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////One of my favorite restaurants in the country and it's still as good as the first time I came five years ago. The atmosphere upstairs is that of a speak-easy. Drinks are on point. Downstairs is darker and super chill with couches, wrap around booths and some tables. The music couldn't be any better or more appropriate- along the lines of older Tribe Called Quest and The Roots.
