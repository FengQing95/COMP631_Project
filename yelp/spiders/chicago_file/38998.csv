Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////While waiting to order food, they start you off with this incredibly soft sourdough bread. Be careful not to fill up too much on this! We ordered the crab cake appetizer and it was seriously one of the best crab cakes i have ever had. The outside had a nice crunch and the crab was fresh and juicy. I could eat this every day!
