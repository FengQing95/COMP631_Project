Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Best Chicago deep dish pizza I've tried in the area. I've tried deep dish pizzas from other restaurants as well, but their butter crust ones are still the most delicious. I have ordered takeout from them multiple times, and I've dined in as well. I've enjoyed my pizza every single time. Definitely worth the wait.
