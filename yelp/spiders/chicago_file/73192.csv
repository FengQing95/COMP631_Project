Little Goat Diner////Next my girlfriend's Smoked Corn Beef Hash with Two Eggs arrived. The best part of this dish was the texture of the hash. Loved that the potato was shredded nice and thin, almost like little strings. Coupled with the smoked corn beef, and the fatty yolk... It definitely was a forkful of heaven.
