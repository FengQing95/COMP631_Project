Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Delicious pizza! We were told to go there by a local so that's always a good sign. Call ahead or be prepared to wait as there is a line. Pick up was 35 minutes and to eat in an hour and a half. They do have a few tables outside so we were lucky enough to get one. So we stood there and waited for pizza and drink a beer. When our food is ready we just eat it there. We ordered the Lou pizza and it was fantastic. First time trying Chicago style pizza.
