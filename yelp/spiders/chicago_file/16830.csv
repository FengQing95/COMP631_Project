Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Deep dish sausage, garlic, green pepper is always worth the wait and the drive.  Born in Chicago and been here most of my life.  This is somewhere I take my friends from out of state.  Never disappointed.  Great at staying organized with large crowds/lines out the door.  You can always get a drink at the bar while you wait.  I don't do fungus, the I'd eat "The Lou" pizza.  Spinach salad was aight... I'm just not into goat cheese.  I'll see if I can get a different cheese next time... Still one of my favorite pizza places!!!!!
