Art Institute of Chicago////The staff is very protective of the precious pieces here, so please respect their positions. I was impressed with how they do cover all the areas to make sure no tampering is going on. The institute is very well organized by timeline, artists, and genres. There is definitely WAY TOO MUCH to see here, so be sure to plan your day accordingly. You can most likely hang out here for about 3-4 hours especially if you love art, maybe hang out longer.
