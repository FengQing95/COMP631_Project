Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The bruschetta was incredible -- best I've ever had!  The deep dish pizza (get the butter crust) was amazing.  Calamari was very good. The only drawback was it was packed and the wait was one and a half hours. That was rough.  We were famished.  Definitely call ahead.  Great service.  Would come back no doubt!  As good as they say.
