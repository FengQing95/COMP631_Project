Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////All of the food was delicious! Â My friends and I ordered 2-3 tapas each and then got the paella to split and it was more than enough food. Everything was so good. The sangria was great too. Great service too, our waitress Katherine was so helpful explaining the menu and being patient with our party. She made our experience great!
