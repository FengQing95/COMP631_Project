Little Goat Diner////We loved this dish! It was the perfect appetizer to share and was a great take on the traditional shrimp cocktail; crispy shrimp wrapped in fried somen noodles with a dollop of creamy sauce on top of bibb lettuce wraps that were then dipped in cocktail sauce. This dish was equally creative and delicious. This is something we look forward to having again!
