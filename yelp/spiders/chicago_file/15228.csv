Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Making a deep dish pizza usually takes about 40 minutes, so there is a wait, as long as you order an appetizer though you're all set.  Our waiter stopped by our table a number of times to tell us how the progress on the pizza was going which was really nice.  When we did get it though, it was delicious, (especially cause we were asked if we wanted butter on the crust!).  It was a simple pizza with peppers and onions, and was awesome, I would recommend this place to anybody from or visiting Chicago!
