Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Deep dish pizza at its finest. I typically don't do chain restaurants but after seeing this place recommended by the best of chefs on the food network, I had to try it. The only downfall is that it takes about 30-40 minutes to cook your pizza so I would recommend getting an appetizer or salad to start but it was definitely worth the wait. It is without a doubt not NY style pizza but that doesn't make it any less fantastic.
