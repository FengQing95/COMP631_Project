Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////simply better than pizzeria due! one slice really does go a LONG way. it does take approx. 30 for the pizza to be made, so sit back and munch on some spinach stuffed cheese bread while you wait. there is no need for a meal before and after since it is quite fulfilling. they do have healthier options on the menu, but enjoy and try the pizza once!
