The Purple Pig////Wine Swine and Dine is exactly what I did here. This place is packed ALL THE TIME. Luckily hopped in on a Friday evening around 3pm (do not take reservations) and had a few tables but opted to sit at the bar. Great choice because the wait staff is phenomenal. They know there wine and helped me taste and pick which suited my taste buds.
