Smoque BBQ////This place is amazing! Why there aren't more Smoque's around, I don't know?!? Wish I could give it 10 whopping stars!!! This gem should not be held a secret especially with the great staff and owners like Allen! I was treated like a star from the moment I walked in to the moment I walked out. I was treated to a great selection of different sauces by Allen. Honestly guys if you haven't been to Smoque by now, you have not lived a day in your life. I would go as far to say that you are not a true Chicagoan if you have not paid Smoque a visit! 'Nuff said!
