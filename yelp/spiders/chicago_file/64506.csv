Smoque BBQ////This place was awesome. I love bbq and trying new places, Smoque BBQ did not disappoint. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with Cole slaw and Mac and cheese. They serve the sandwich with two different sides of bbq sauce (both delicious). The Mac and cheese was hands down the best I've ever had at any restaurant. Staff was attentive and friendly. And to top it off, the place is BYOB
