Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our server was very helpful, he offered us some suggestions to help us narrow down our choices from the HUGE menu (~70 different tapas choices). We decided to go with the stuffed mushrooms, spanish sausage plate, fried chicken thighs with peri-peri, hanger steak, and the garlic shrimp. Everything came out quickly after we ordered, so if you're looking for a slower paced meal, I would recommend ordering as you go. Oh! We also got the seasonal sangria (a pitcher, about 6 glasses, was $30 versus $10 per glass normally) which was a spiced apple and white wine version - delish and perfect for fall! Anyways, the food was all very tasty and reasonably sized portions for the price - perfect for splitting between 3-4 people. Our favorites were the hanger steak and the spanish sausages.
