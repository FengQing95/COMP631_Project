Smoque BBQ////Amazing food! The brisket is sent from heaven above, and the coleslaw - UNREAL. The side salad is a nice accompaniment to the meat, and byob is always appreciated. Great service and staff - will be back. Next time I will remember that you can't byob and eat outside. We had to move inside after popping open the wine, but the atmosphere inside was just as nice.
