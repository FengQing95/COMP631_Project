Art Institute of Chicago////I can't say enough good about the Art Institute experience: simply a marvelous & magical expedition upon each visit. Most docents are wonderfully warm & welcoming. Accessibility for differently abled guests are comprehensive. And the special exhibits are unique, fascinating, and meticulously curated. KUDOS all around!
