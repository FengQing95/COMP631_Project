Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Hubby brought the pizza back to our hotel room.  Packaging of the pie was perfect, with a thin plastic covering protecting the tomato sauce from the cardboard box top.  The little Parmesan side was slightly less than what we needed for our taste, so if you like Parmesan ask for extra!
