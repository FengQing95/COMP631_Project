Art Institute of Chicago////True story: took my 6yo last year. I insisted we check out at least one we collection for him. We walk up to a Jackson Pollack where a number of people are intently examining it. He exclaims (very loudly) "This is NOT art" and walks away. Couldn't agree more little dude :)
