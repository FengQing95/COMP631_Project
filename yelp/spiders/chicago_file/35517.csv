Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////* Peppered Duck & Goat Cheese Terrine. Sounds really good. Looks less than incredibly good. Tastes overrated. I thought this sounded like a sure winner but in the end, no such luck. The meat was pressed with the goat cheese in the middle and an apricot marmalade and some bread to go with it. The combination really didn't work that well for me. But the real issue was that the terrine patty simply did not have a whole lot of flavor. And the goat cheese really did not stand out. Not sure what they did to this, but the dish was bland and uneventful.
