Little Goat Diner////Service: These folks were firing on all cylinders. Their e-ticket system went down while we were there but you would not know it. Helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. My buddy recognized the owner/ chef (Top Chef winner from season 4) as she stood in front of us at the counter but he was a bit too shy to say anything...so I did. Chef Stephanie Izard was gracious and warm. It topped off the evening.
