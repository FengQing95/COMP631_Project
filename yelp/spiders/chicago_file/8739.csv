Art Institute of Chicago////I love the Art Institute! It's a beautiful space, great for people watching, and overall a fantastic way to spend the day. The only down side is the price- although, I'll admit, I live in DC where everything is free so I'm definitely spoiled. I don't like that it's the same price all day- wouldn't it make more sense to have a sliding scale of prices so if you come in around 2 or 3 maybe you pay half? Not everyone can take a whole day at the museum! Overall, though, this is definitely a great spot to add to your Chicago travels or to rediscover if you're a local and haven't been in a while.
