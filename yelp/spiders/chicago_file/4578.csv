The Purple Pig////I have lived in Chicago for 2.5 years and have heard really good things about the purple pig. It's one of those restaurants that tourists always try to eat at when they come visit Chicago (along with girl & the goat, publican, wild berry, au cheval, etc). So I thought I'd finally give it a try. My boyfriend and I opted for an early dinner and came at 5pm on a Sunday night because we really did not want to have to wait for a table. They had a table for two inside but we decided to sit outside since it was a milder winter evening (upper 30s). They do have heat lamps outside. Still chilly but we kept our coats on. It was much more peaceful outside. The small inside space makes it really loud and hard to have conversation. Service was good.
