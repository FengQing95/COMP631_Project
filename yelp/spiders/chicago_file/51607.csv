Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is one of my go-to's in Chicago. I've come here multiple times with a group of girlfriends, and Baba never seems to disappoint. Their tapas are delicious and the ambiance is light and fun. I always start with a pitcher of the sangria(all of the flavors are good!) and a mini pinxtos plate. I love that you can get a mini sample of many things at once!
