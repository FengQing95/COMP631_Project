Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute is one of most prominent Chicago attractions for everyone who loves art. It is mostly known for the impressionist paintings.  However,  besides the fabulous impressionists collection, I  also really like their modern art, ancient Greek/Roman section, and the Miniature Room collections. Every time I visit, I spend hours wandering through different rooms and reading  about people depicted in the paintings. My When I get hungry and tired,  I make my way to a cafe downstairs and sit by a fountain in a courtyard.  Afterward I  am energized and ready to explore the Art Institute again.
