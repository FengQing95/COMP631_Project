Little Goat Diner////The menu is a la carte/small-plates style, but in a diner atmosphere, which is confusing.  Basically instead of ordering a burger w/fries, you pay $14 for your burger + $4 for your fries.  You could also choose a different side dish.  Part of the reason I go to nicer places is that I trust the chefs and their experienced palates to pair foods in an interesting and inventive way for me.  Having the responsibility myself always worries me that I'll put two clashing dishes together.  That said, the risk seems mitigated at Little Goat because the menu is fairly cohesive: American comfort foods with a gentle Korean twist.
