Smoque BBQ////The place is always packed, so you may be standing in a small to rather large line.  One time, we had called in an order to pick up at 5:30pm, but they told us it wouldn't be ready till 7pm.  When we got there, the line was out the door and around the side of the building.  I was so glad we called for take out, but I would have stood in line for this barbecue.
