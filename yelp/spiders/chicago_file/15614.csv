Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Great service. Excellent chicago deep dish. We ordered one pizza and shared it between four ravenous girls. Half of us weren't able to finish our slices because they were so big. However, I must note that the slices weren't as big or thick as the ones offered at Pizzeria Uno. Despite that, I liked Lou Malnati's better in comparison to taste.
