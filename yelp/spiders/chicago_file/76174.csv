Little Goat Diner////At first glance the line/wait may be off putting, but to say it's worth it would be an understatement. They do take reservations so you can always plan ahead and avoid the wait. The food is a wide selection of combinations that you wouldn't think of. Surprisingly enough they work. From paratha burritos to a breakfast spaghetti that has clams.
