Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The setting was beautiful. Dimly lit with gorgeous fixtures, exposed brick walls, a huge bar, lots of different types of seating and great music.  Our friends joined us and we were sat at a small round table in the center of the place.  I wish it was a larger more comfortable booth but we enjoyed the setting.
