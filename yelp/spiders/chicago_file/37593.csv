Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My bf took me here on an impromptu date night. Wasn't bad actually! I ordered the salmon and he ordered the filet. We ordered the mash potatoes to share. So you know all sides and apps are of shareable size. Both menu items were pretty good, I guess I just expected more. Maybe I should've ordered something else? It also doesn't help that we had maestros just last week. Maybe I was doing to much comparing? Well... The service and ambience were also great. I'd probably give them another chance in the future.
