Art Institute of Chicago////As someone who isn't into art too much or know too much about it, I enjoyed some of the interactive modern art and the medieval armory. Also, they have art work and photographs of the revolutionary period that took place in Japan in the 60's and I thought that was incredible to see the struggle that not only too place in the US but around the world. (I'm more of a history facts person).
