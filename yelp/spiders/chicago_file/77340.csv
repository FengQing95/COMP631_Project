Little Goat Diner////We waited awhile for our server to greet us, she never shared her name (we had to ask later when trying to flag her down). Our table was set up incompletely: 6 of us and only 2 had forks and only 4 had side plates. We ordered and then things just went downhill. First 3 of the kids meals came out, then it took over 5 minutes for an adult meal and the other kids meal, then OVER 5 minutes for the final adult meal to come out. Kids were done! We had also asked the guy who dropped off the first round for the forks we were missing, he said okay and then walked right off to the kitchen and started running food again!
