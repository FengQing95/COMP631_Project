Little Goat Diner////I've been to Little Goat a handfull of times, and it's unforuntate that I waited to have a bad experience before writing a review.  Past experiences have been hit or miss, but overall the food quality was good.  My fiance and I went again last Saturday, and it seemed like the "B-Team" was working.  Service was very slow, customer service was poor, and the food was a disaster.  I ordered the beef ravioli, which (along with everything else) has a sparse description.  What came to the table was a goopy, soggy, unfortunate looking mess of a meal.  After attempting to eat the food for a few minutes, I decided to send it back and request something simpler (more standard).  Despite being painfully slow, our waitress was polite and exhanged out the meals.
