Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We tried the peppered duck and goat cheese terrine (very unique taste and highly recommend trying), crab stuffed avocado (a plentiful and very tasty grade of crab served in and avocado next to a bed of butter leaf lettuce) and 6 oz filet mignon (cooked to perfection) with a herb butter sauce that makes everything in life better.  Our waiter was a diva, and I absolutely loved him.  It was clear that he was passionate about the food and the venue itself, which sold us on his outstanding recommendations.  AND he told my boyfriend "happy birthday" right off the bat, establishing from the very beginning that he was attentive to our party :)
