Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Paella: the paella came out right on time, shortly after we finished all the tapas and had a few minutes to digest the food a bit. It is a minimum of two orders and it was just enough to split between five people. I likd the paella but I was a bit full towards the end so I didn't enjoy it as much as I could have.
