Little Goat Diner////I love Stephanie and I love Top Chef but my sammich left much to be desired. I got the Los Drowned and thought it would be made with braised beef but it wasn't. It was difficult to eat and the big hunks of beef, although good, weren't very flavorful. My friend got the fish tostadas and they were delicious. So maybe I just made a bad choice. When I go to visit my friends again, I'll give it a second chance and order something else. The decor is gorgeous and it's bright and airy.
