Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////It's been years since I've been back. What a great experience. Delicious food and a very engaging staff. The place was hopping. We got seated and quickly had cocktails and the first of many courses started to arrive. Brussels Sprouts salad, cheese board, spicy garlic shrimp, roasted potatoes, chicken and sausage, roasted salmon and many more wonderful dishes. We finished with raspberry sorbet, chocolate cake, a salted caramel brownie and a butterscotch custard that was amazing. Loved every bit of it!
