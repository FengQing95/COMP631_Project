Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I ALWAYS get the potatas bravas. However, over the years, the portion has gotten smaller. They're still tasty. My friend got the seared salmon in a romescu sauce. It was so good. The bacon wrapped date and ib√©rico chorizo pinxtos were perfect. The pinxto allows you to order by piece, which isn't bad if you're the only one who wants that particular dish. Smaller portion for a smaller price. I got the garlic shrimp...which is an always for me. They're always so good. We finished this off with a pitcher of peach sangria. It was yummy! Just too much ice. I wish we could've ordered a couple of more dishes but my friend didn't really understand the concept of tapas.
