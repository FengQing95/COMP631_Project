Smoque BBQ////Very very good barbecue!!! the brisket is just amazing! moist, crispy outside. the best part of this place is that the food is lean!!! the plate stays clean, not full of oul and still the meat is tender. plus, the cole slaw is perhaps the best I ever had. Ribs are good but nothing crazy. And they give you plenty of gooood fries!!!
