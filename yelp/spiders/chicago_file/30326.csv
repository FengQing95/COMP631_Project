Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The Lou which I had last time wasn't great, but I had with crustless and personal size, so I was hoping this time was better, but no. It was the same. I didn't like it. On the other hand, The Malnati Chicago Classis tasted good which was good surprise. I wish I knew that at the first time. It had chunk of tomatoes and very flavorful.
