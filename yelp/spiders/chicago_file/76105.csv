Little Goat Diner////Service/Atmosphere: The Little Goat decor takes quintessential American diner items and decor and gives them a serious upgrade. While still casual, the place is clean, modern, and full of natural lighting during the day. During the summer they also have outdoor seating. The service here is consistently top-notch: fast, attentive, and very friendly. As a bonus, they also have a gluten-free menu and do their best to accommodate food allergies or restrictions.
