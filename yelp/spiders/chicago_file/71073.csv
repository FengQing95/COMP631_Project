Little Goat Diner////The little goat is as amazing as everyone says it is! We came here for brunch and had about a 30 min wait on a Sunday at 10:30am. Our waitress was extremely nice and smiley- great way to start a Sunday morning after a long Saturday night. We ordered the paratha burrito, crispy fish tostadoas, and the cheesy garlic bread. I so ordered the wildflower cocktail. The fish tostadas were definitely the winner, and the drink looked cute but sure was strong- another winner! Highly recommend this place for brunch!
