Art Institute of Chicago////While I didn't have a lot of time to peruse the entire grounds or their full collection, I really like that it was a well-organized venue with helpful staff. I interned at some museums while I was in college and the thing that is the bane of my existence when visiting others is a staff member that doesn't know shit about important things like where the bathroom is or where a certain exhibit is located.
