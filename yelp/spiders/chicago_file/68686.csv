Little Goat Diner////We arrived for brunch around 10:30 on Sunday morning - just in time to miss the crowds - and were seated immediately at the bar. Not sure if it's the best or worst seat in the house as you have the opportunity to see every amazing entree that comes out and second guess your order the entire time.
