Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Get the steak. I say this because we were swayed by all these phenomenal reviews of non-steak things, and were honestly disappointed. The baked goat cheese was fine, but overpriced for what was basically marinara and Texas toast. The bacon had great flavor but bordered on undercooked for me. The prime rib sandwich was a bit bland and a little disappointing.
