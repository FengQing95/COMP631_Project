Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came with a buddy while visiting Chicago, couldnt leave without trying Chicago style pizza. Got recommended this place by multiple people. Upon arriving, we see a long line out the door and at least 20 people waiting. We made a reservation for 2 and made our way to the full bar to order a drink while waiting. Within 5 minutes, a couple left and we took their spots. We took our name off of the waiitng list and ordered at the bar. The pizza takes about 40 minutes to cook so if your dining in, they suggest preordering it so you don't have to wait as long. We ordered garlic bread and a small (for 2 people) Chicago deep dish classic pizza. About 40 minutes later we see what seemed like a rather small pizza in front of us that we imagined would be bigger. It was not a problem as I did not finish my half. The pizza was excellent and the service was 2nd to none. Glad we stopped in and can say we had chicago style pizza, and come back if ever in chicago again!
