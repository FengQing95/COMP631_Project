Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ordered the lunch special which was a personal deep dish (sausage) pizza and a side salad for total $11.10. I thought it was plenty of food- I couldn't even finish it. My first thought was that the pizza is very small, but don't let your eyes deceive you- remember that it is deep dish and there is some body to that pizza. Â
