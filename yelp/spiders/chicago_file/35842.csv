Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bacon tomato salad.   This was good but we agreed to was about a 6 on a scale of 10 being the best.  The bacon on this was unbelievable.  We split two salads four ways and trust me we made sure the bacon split was perfectly even. .  The wedge salad which could be boring was absolutely awesome. Best ever. 10 all the way!
