The Purple Pig////This time we actually had reservations for a different restaurant and just dropped in for a drink. Â The bartender was super helpful and we both enjoyed our choices. My sister had a cocktail and I enjoyed a smooth Malbec from Argentina. I always end up striking up conversations with other patrons here because the food is so interesting, so everyone wants to share and discuss.
