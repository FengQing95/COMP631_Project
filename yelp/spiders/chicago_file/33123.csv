Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great hip place very busy. I was in downstairs bar at the bar. Great drinks Chicago cut ribeye somewhat disappointing too much fat but tasty! The bacon appetizer was not good at all.  The shrimp appetizer well worth it and outstanding. I would go back can't always be perfect for everyone.  Went before hawks game on a Friday night.
