Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I keep hearing all about this place so I figured I had to try it!  The only other time I've had tapas was in Spain, so I guess my expectations were pretty high.   We had a reservation and were seated right away... only after we had a seat did we realize we were outside (yea it's December..) I guess they use their patio all year long with covers and heaters... but it was still pretty cold and I was sad I checked my coat.  The patio is probably really nice in the summer but if you have a choice, try to dine inside during the cold months!  There was just 2 of us so our waiter suggested we order 5 small plates which was a pretty good amount.  The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't remarkable.  As for the Sangria, we thought it tasted a little bit like Boones Farm!  Not at all comparable to the real Spanish Sangria!  Also I should mention this place was CRAZY loud and there were a lot of large groups.  Not really a great date place, especially if you're freezing outside!  I might come back here with a group but it wasn't anything special.  I guess for authentic tapas I should go back  to Barcelona...
