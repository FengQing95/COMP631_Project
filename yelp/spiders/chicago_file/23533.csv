Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I understand this is a touristy place so that's probably why I am getting this vibe.  One thing I didn't like though was that service seemed very very rushed.  As soon as we had served the last slice of pizza, out waitress seemed to want us to leave soon.  All in all, I enjoyed my experience but this isn't a place I would suggest making a special trip for.
