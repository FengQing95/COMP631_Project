Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The tapas menu is delightfully mixed with hot and cold, sea and land creatures and even some vegetarian (for those so inclined).  The sangria is bright and cheerful (I recommend the classic red).  Highlights:  Goat Cheese Dip, BACON WRAPPED DATES, Fried Calamari and any everything else.
