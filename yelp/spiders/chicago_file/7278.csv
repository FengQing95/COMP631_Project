Art Institute of Chicago////Grab a visitor guide and do the "one hour tour" on the back. It'll give you a look at several of the must-see pieces in the museum (American gothic, A Sunday on la grande jatte, seated Buddha) without having to wander aimlessly and miss them. I also recommend Van Gogh, Monet, and Degas!
