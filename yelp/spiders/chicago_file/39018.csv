Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We ordered a bone-in filet mignon and (42 day) dry rub NY Strip as our entrees, along with some buttery mashed potatoes and broccoli as our shareable sides. To say those steaks were perfection on a plate just doesn't do them justice.  I kid you not...when the main course arrived, I don't think we said a word to each other in a solid 5 minutes...both of us reveling in the amazing flavors that were rocking our palates (is that spelled right?). John had suggested a Scherrer Pinot Noir to go with our entrees, told us the story of the winery and offered a sample prior to ordering...it was absolutely delicious and perfectly matched our steaks.  They even provide the rock salt in a separate tin so you can put as much as you want on to bring out the flavor but not over do it..and those potatoes, sigh, just wow!
