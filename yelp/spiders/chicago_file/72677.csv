Little Goat Diner////Was busy on a Saturday night at 10pm. Had to wait just 15 minutes for a table. Really neat decor-a step up from your typical diner and almost set back in the seventies but reminds you of your local diner at the same time. Seemed like they were a little understaffed but the waiter was nice and food was fantastic! Delicious and satisfying and a fun good experience.
