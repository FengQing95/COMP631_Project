Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Hands down my favorite place to eat in Chicago. Service is stellar which is impressive considering its size. Bread is 100% out of this world and the olive oil is clearly of high quality. I could eat that alone and be happy. Great alioli as well. I've been several times now and most stuff on the menu is delicious. The presa ib√©rica is a must.
