Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We are visiting from out of town and heard this place is a local favorite so we were excited to try. When we walked in, we're weren't really greeted which is fine I guess.. No "hi" or "welcome" not even a smile LOL. So We asked to order take out and the host/cashier said it was going to be about 30-35 minutes which was fine with us. After 35 minutes I asked if our pizza was almost ready and the host said "10 more minutes" so we waited another 10 minutes so I asked again and a different worker came out and said it's gonna be about 25 more minutes.. we were there for almost an hour waiting for a pizza, and mind you it was not busy at all. I'm not sure what was going on that day but no one really helped us out. The host/cashier was rude, I don't know if she was having a bad day or what but she didn't even apologize or acknowledge that they messed something up. And as for the pizza, it was good, nothing great.
