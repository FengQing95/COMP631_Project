Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Went in on a Sunday morning and got right through the 45-60 min wait by using the app. Very convenient especially on a cold day. Friendly staff and quick service is what I loved. Last thing you want to do in the morning is wait a long time to be helped and served your breakfast. Had the chocolate chip pancakes and the Denver skillet. Denver skillet was great and the pancakes were just good, nothing special. (Walks Bros. Chocolate Pancakes can't be beat) Will try different pancakes next time. Parking around was pricey, $7 per 1 hour of metered parking...
