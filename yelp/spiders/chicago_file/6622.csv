The Purple Pig////The next dish was the Roasted Bone Marrow ($15). I've never had bone marrow like this before; the wait staff instructs you to spread it in the bread, sprinkle on some salt, and finally top it with the parsley and capers. The bone marrow is like a less attractive looking butter; nothing about this dish stood out. It would have been better if this dish came out first since it's more like an appetizer than the first dish.
