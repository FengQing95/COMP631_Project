Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Yup, I think this is my favorite Chicago pizza spot.  Came here for lunch and they have a great deal, personal pizza with a salad, can be in and out of there in less than thirty minutes if you want for under $10.  And yes, you leave full with that $10 meal....which makes me think about how unhealthy that pizza is, but that's a different conversation...ha.
