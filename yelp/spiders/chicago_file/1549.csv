Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Perfect satisfying brunch after red eye flight and long nap! Not too rich or heavy, just right dose of comfort brunch for health conscious folks. I had their veggie omelette, fruit salad, fresh squeezed orange juice, and berrycious pancake. Yum!! I also sampled my son's Oreo s'mores pancake and mango shake. It's perfect! What a treat!
