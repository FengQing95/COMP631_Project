Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My favorite brunch place in Chicago!! I try bringing all my out of town visitors here if I can! I love their menu, its fresh and unique! I like that it's a tapas, it's perfect to come here with a group of people and try out different things. I love their baked egg and cute French toast on a stick. Great mimosas and sangrias as well!
