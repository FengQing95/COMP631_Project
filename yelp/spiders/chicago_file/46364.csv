Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ba-ba-reeba was once my go-to for special occasions.  Thankfully, since Yelp entered my restaurant-sheltered life,  I realize there are many more NEW places perfect for birthdays, girls' nights out and let's get tipsy Tuesdays!  In a way, I have outgrown my Ba-Ba-Reeba days.  However, I will never turn down one of their a bacon-wrapped dates.  Just the thought makes me salivate.
