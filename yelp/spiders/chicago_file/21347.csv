Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We heard this was one of the best or known pizza places in Chicago and so I just had to come here since I'm a pizza lover. We ordered "The Lou" which is pretty much a veggie deepdish pizza. All of their deepdish pizza comes with a buttercrust which was very scrumptious, especially if you love bread like me! We also got a dessert coupon from our hotel (Hyatt in magnificent mile) and so we decided to get the Chocolate Chip Pizza. It's pretty much the exact same thing as the pazookie from BJ's--it's a chocolate chip cookie in a deepdish pan (served warm) and has vanilla icecream on top of it. I also heard The Original Gino's East was really good. That was right by our hotel and we passed it all the time when walking around, and there was always a long line at night which is a good sign? I definitely want to try there as well next time.
