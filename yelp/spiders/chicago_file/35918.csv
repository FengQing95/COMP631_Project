Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've been here twice and each time LOVED it. I believe both times I started with their oysters and then moved on to a steak (of course). My medium rare filet has always been cooked perfectly, and the bread they bring with the meal is so fresh and delicious. But the real winner was the brussels sprouts. These are easily the best brussels sprouts I've EVER had. Â I could eat them with every meal. Perfect texture and char, and dusted with Parmesan (I believe), these brussels sprouts had me dreaming of them for a week after I was last here. And I actually just dreamt of them last night which is the reason I'm writing this review...
