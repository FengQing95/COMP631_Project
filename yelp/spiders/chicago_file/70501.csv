Little Goat Diner////I came here last night with a girlfriend and we really enjoyed our time.  We each ordered a cocktail off the drink list- my friend ordered the "In a Pickle" cocktail and I ordered "King & Rye".  The drinks were good, strong enough for the price so I was satisfied.  We ordered the tempura mashed potatoes to share and they were good just a small portion for what you get.  Everything is a la carte so your bill runs up quickly.  I ordered the Los Drowned sandwich and it was good (idk if it was $14 good...) and my friend ordered the Tonkatsu sandwich.  We each got the Little Goat latte for dessert and our bill came to nearly $80.  I think they can probably get away with charging $14/sandwich with no side because they're in the west loop and are affiliated with The Girl & the Goat but I feel like for diner food, it's a bit expensive for what you actually get.  Iffy about going back when you can get a better sandwich for less money elsewhere.
