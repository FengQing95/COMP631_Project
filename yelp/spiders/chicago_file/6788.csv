Art Institute of Chicago////I just read Gourmet Guru's outstanding review of the Art Institute of Chicago and can't believe I forgot to review it until now!  Chicago was my hometown for almost half a century.  I have been to the Art Institute more times than I could ever count.  I took kiddie art classes there when I was six, for which I got to ride the train 'downtown' from the 'burbs with my Mom every Saturday.  I felt so important - I think that was part of the plan!  One ongoing assignment for the kiddie class was to carry a little sketchbook with us at all times and fill it up.  I remember sitting on the front steps of the magnificent building that houses the Museum, sketching the famous bronze lions (the two are the most photographed sculptures in metropolitan Chicago).  I still have the sketchbooks.  I loved when they put wreaths around the lions' necks at Christmastime.  I very nearly attended the School of the Art Institute for college on scholarship (fine art major), but didn't want to get stuck living at home, so ended up going out of state instead.  Another great memory I have is my annual trek to the Museum's gift shop to buy my Holiday cards.  And.....whenever I would meet friends in the city, it would usually be on the steps of the Art Institute, which was across the street from my train station.  Who would think that an art museum could be such an important part of someone's life and hold such treasured personal memories?
