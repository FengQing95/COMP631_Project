Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Probably the best pizza I have ever had!! I am from LA and my God Lou Malnati's isthe best. My buddy and I took a trip to Chicago recently and Lou Malnati's was on our list. We tried it on our second night being in the city. It was our second time trying Chicago deep dish and this was the best we had. We liked the whole concept of ordering when you get to the restaurant and having your order ready when you take a seat. The wait was definitely worth it!! The cheese on the pizza was probably the greatest cheese a pizza can have. If youre headed to Chicago, Lou Malnati's is a must try!!
