Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////had a really fun brunch here! I loooove tapas! the restaurant is in a great little location with lots of street parking around. we had a reservation, but probably would have been seated fairly quickly even without one. service was super friendly! the waitress had a lot of good suggestions as the menu looks so scrumptious, you'll want to order it all if you don't narrow it down! the basket of bread and olive oil on the table upon arrival was a nice touch. the almond nutella is verrrrry good as are the baked eggs! they have a make your own bloody mary bar which friends at the table enjoyed. I, on the other hand, stuck to the fresh squeezed juice which was quite tasty even though it's not made in house. definitely looking forward to visiting here again as there are ton of items I'd still like to try!
