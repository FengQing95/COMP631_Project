Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is definitely good but WOW, everyone is salivating over it. I feel like people are excited to give it 4 stars before even taking their first bite. A bit overhyped? I thought the fish here was fresh and delicious. The sangria? Alright. The stuffed mushrooms? Oh my God, people, these are stuffed mushrooms! I feel like the 8 year old I babysat for could make them! They were good but nothing to run home and tell mom about! I honestly prefer Avec over this place, if they are comparable in any way. I know Avec isn't just tapas, however.
