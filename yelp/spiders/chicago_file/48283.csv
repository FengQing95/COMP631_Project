Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My husband and I always end up here for date night although we have a list of places we've been wanting to try. I work in the food/service industry so I like good service and amazing delicious food which we always get here. We usually walk in and get a spot at the bar instead of waiting for a table. The service at the bar is very...good! Victor and Fernando are on top of things there. The great service and food just keeps us coming back!
