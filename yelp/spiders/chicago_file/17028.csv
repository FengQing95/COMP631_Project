Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I am a Chicago native and we take our pizza seriously.  Just like you have to choose between the Cubs & Sox, you have to choose a pizza.  Lou Malnati's is my family's pizza and always will be.  I've been going there since I was a little girl and I see no reason to stop any time soon.  They are the best.
