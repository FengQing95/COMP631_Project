Little Goat Diner////Really artsy inside the restaurant. My gf wanted to go because was impressed with all the reviews. I had the banh mi burger I loved the idea but I didn't really enjoy it. My gf had biscuit and gravy & shrimp/grits which she enjoyed for the most part. The menu has a ton of uniques I will definitely be back when I go back to Chicago.
