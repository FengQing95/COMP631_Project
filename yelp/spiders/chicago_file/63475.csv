Smoque BBQ////I love this place ! I have been here twice! Once in 2010! Another visit was today September, 19, 2015 ! I went with my dad for an early dinner. He had the baby back ribs platter with beans, brisket chili, and slaw ! I had the pulled pork platter with Mac n cheese, beans, and slaw! Everything was delicious !! We ordered some peach cobbler and a couple pieces of cornbread for the trip home ! We were even able to meet one of the owners Barry and got a picture with Barry and "Guy" from Triple D in the background ! If you are ever in Chicago, I recommend you stop here for some great bbq! This place has legit yummy bbq!
