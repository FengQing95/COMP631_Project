Smoque BBQ////I had the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich platter.  1/2 pulled pork and 1/2 chopped brisket with beans and slaw.  The meat was dry.  Both of them.  Either they were cooked to death or they sat in a warming tray for a long time and we got the end of lunch service.  The beans were really tasty.  The slaw was good, vinegar style, I like it.  My friend had the 1/2 and 1/2 ribs.  1/2 St. Louis and 1/2 Baby Back.  They were okay.  I liked that they weren't cooked to death and falling off the bone, they still had some structure to them.  They were tasty, but I've had way better.  He had beans, slaw and mac & cheese.  The mac and cheese was ok, but not my fave.
