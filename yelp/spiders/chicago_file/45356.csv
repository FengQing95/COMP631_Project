Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love this place. I love any excuse to go here. My favorite part? The sangria. My favorite place to sit? One of the 3 tables by the window/bar area. I haven't eaten anything that I didn't thoroughly enjoy. And what's nice is if each person at the table orders one tapas dish, you all share a pitcher of sangria that could possibly be all you really need. There are times when you might decide to order an extra dish or so but they give you tons of bread and olive oil you can really get away with just ordering one tapas dish each. This is definately a place you don't want to go to by yourself. Unless you sit at the bar and drink the sangria. Mmm...
