Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Could be the best steak I have ever had, huge 22 oz thick juicy cut - Classic Ribeye Chicago Cut. Did not need and steak sauce or condiments, it was great by itself. Shared the Thick Cut Bacon and Pomme Frites. The Thick Cit Bacon was probably the best bacon I have ever had, it had a sweet crispy taste. The Pommes Frites with the garlic mayo was like eating garlic fries without them getting soggy. Could not be more pleased with this extraordinary food feast experience. Your loss if you do not go, make reservations.
