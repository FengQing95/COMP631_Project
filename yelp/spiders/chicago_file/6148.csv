The Purple Pig////Regrettably, I did not continue my meal after ordering a sangria (that was sadly watered down) and for the fact that the waiter, Heriberto did not seem too fond of me inquiring about the drink selection. Instead of receiving a suggestion he was cold and dismissive. It made me feel uncomfortable/uneasy, so the next time he came to get my order I asked for the check and left.
