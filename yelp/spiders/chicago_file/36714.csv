Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavettes was amazing in both service and in food!  I don't eat meat on a regular basis but Bavettes steak has made me a convert!! The meal started with fresh soft bread.  We ordered the filet mignion, beef short rib pasta & 3 sides : brusssel sprouts, creamed spinach & Mac and cheese.
