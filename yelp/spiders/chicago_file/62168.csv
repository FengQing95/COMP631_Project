Smoque BBQ////A coworker of mine offered to pick up Smoque for lunch one day. Even with the drive over to Lakeview the food was still warm and so unbelievably delicious. I mean this was a few weeks ago and I just had a daydream about it. Do yourself a solid and go. Order the brisket. Eat as much as you can. It's orgasmic.
