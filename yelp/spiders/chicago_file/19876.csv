Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Chicago's best pizza? Just might be! Service was quick and attentive. Since deep dish takes some time to cook, we were able to order our pizza ahead of time while we waited for a table. We started with Calamari and both the BuffaLou Â and Bar-B-Lou Wings. The Calamari was fried perfectly with a tasty Marinara sauce and the wings were plump and juicy. Just a perfect amount of sauce to not make it too messy to eat! Then out came the star of the meal....The Malnati Chicago Classic. The Buttercrust makes the pizza, along with the sausage, extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce. No room for dessert here! Make this the fist pizza place you checkout in Chicago!
