Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love this place! It is one of the only tapas places that I have been that I find filling and reasonably priced. The variety of plate options is great for different diets and the drinks are unique and tasty. We attended one of their Flamenco dinners and it was awesome. The dancers and music was great and we loved the entertainment to go along with our delicious food and drinks. I highly recommend the potatoes bravos!
