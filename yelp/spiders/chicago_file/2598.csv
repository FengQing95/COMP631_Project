The Purple Pig////As far as food, we went with the roasted bone marrow (spread), the broccoli antipasti, the clam and cuttlefish brodetto, and the milk braised pork shoulder. Each was delicious and flavorful in its own way. The bone marrow was essentially meat butter and was a tasty spread for their perfectly toasted bread. Topped with some sea salt and salad, each bite was so well balanced in flavor and texture. The brodetto was served like a black pot pie and its cool appearance drew the attention of others sharing our table.The broth was terrific (although very hot, like magma hot), especially when soaked up by the octopus ink pita bread. My favorite dish was the tender and juicy pork shoulder, which was a much bigger portion than I expected. It should come as no surprise given the restaurant's name, but they do pork really well. My friend's favorite was the broccoli, which was crispy, fresh and loaded with roasted garlic flavor, then topped with toasted bread crumbs for an extra crunch.
