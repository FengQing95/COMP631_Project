Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Wildberry Cafe is packed and we have to wait for a table.  There are loads of business people and families out for the day.  After we finally get seated, our server Emma, a very friendly and sweet young girl stops over to take our orders.  My daughter starts by ordering an Omelet at $8.95 with a side of hash browns.  She also gets a coffee for $2.50 that Emma refills at least three times.  My daughter loved her omelet and hash browns and her order was so huge that she had plenty to take home for another meal.  I ordered the Havarti and Bacon Burger for $10.95 that came with some extremely tasty fries.  They were thin cut and seasoned just right.  The burger was great, a bit on the greasy side, I don't know if that was the cheese or the grilled onions on the burger but it was really good.  As long time readers you know I just LOVE my bacon and Havarti is just the best cheese out there.  It is so smooth, light and fresh tasting.  I also ordered a side of their famous Corn Beef Hash at $4.25 and oh man was the corn beef hash sooo good.  It truly tasted like there was freshly made corn beef in the hash and not that processed stuff.  It probably was some of the best corn beef hash I have ever had at a restaurant.  I also took home about half my meal as I was just so full.
