Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This last time (a very slow monday at 5ish) we got there at the quoted time & proceeded to wait & wait for our order. We ordered 2 gluten free pizzas & a house salad with house dressing on the side. Yes I know it is a mockery of a true butter crust pizza; but gluten hurts my Palindrome's belly so gluten free it is. They are actually not bad. So we got our usual mushrooms with spinach that has the onions, garlic & basil.
