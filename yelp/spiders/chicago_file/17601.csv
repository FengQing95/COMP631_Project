Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It doesn't help that the waiter just comes back to our table to ask my girlfriend and I if we were doing okay every 10minutes while he sure as hell know that we're just waiting and wondering when the hell we will get to eat. Mind you, my girlfriend's vegan so she can't even have the mozzarella sticks (and don't dare say the dough isn't vegan, we had believed it was...let us live that lie).
