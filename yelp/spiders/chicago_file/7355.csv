Art Institute of Chicago////The only reason why I don't give all 5 stars this: the artwork of the American Southwest is my favorite section.  It was downstairs, by the American Colonial artwork.  One day, it was completely blocked off - I couldn't go in to admire the artwork in there.  I asked two information desks what had happened and neither of them knew what I was talking about.  I sent two emails and never got any replies.  It was very disappointing to have lost that section, not knowing why or when it'd return.
