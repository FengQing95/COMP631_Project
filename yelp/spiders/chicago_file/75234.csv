Little Goat Diner////The price was right for us, which was great (about $30 for both of our meals). As I've already mentioned a few times in this review, I do intend to come back to Little Goat to try more. I would be interested in trying one of the drinks as well as one of the drinks next time, too. We just couldn't possibly fit in any more on this particular visit. We were already back at the apartment and thinking about going to bed by the time we got the "your table is now ready" text from Au Cheval. Little Goat was an excellent alternative and I suggest you do the same if you're trying to get into another restaurant with a long wait. Little Goat is definitely a destination worth its own separate visit.
