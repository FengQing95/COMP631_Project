Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Overall, the pancake selection here looks pretty unique. I would recommend trying the berry bliss. However, I expect breakfast places to know how to cook an egg well, and Wildberry got it wrong twice. This place was average in my book, and not a place I plan on trying again.
