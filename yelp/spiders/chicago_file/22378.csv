Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Place our order for the kids menu, because of course they ask you to pre-order your pizza for faster service...nope, still a half an hour after seating did we get the Medium, thin crust, half pepperoni and half basil/onion...Yes, not the deep dish, but a pretty basic and general pizza, why did it take so long???!!!! Best part is when that pizza arrived...
