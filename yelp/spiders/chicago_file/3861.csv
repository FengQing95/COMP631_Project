The Purple Pig////What a great way to start the trip with a great meal at the Purple pig! Love the ambiance and the food. The place was really busy and a great local place to hang out. They have amazing selection of wines/drinks. We tried about 5 different appetizers and our favorites were the bone marrow, squid and octopus.
