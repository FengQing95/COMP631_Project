Art Institute of Chicago////Since it was vacation week for most schools around the country, there were some little monsters who did not know how to behave in an art museum and should have been over at the Shedd Aquarium instead. That one qualm cannot be held against the Art Institute as the monsters' parents are obviously at fault since they are the ones who could not care less about anyone other than themselves.
