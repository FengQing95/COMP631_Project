Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Got off the Plane checked into the hotel and went straight to Lou Malnati's Pizzeria Oh My what a treat. We started off with the brochette it was Amazing a must try. Then we had the Chicago classic I would eat here at least once a week if I lived here. We came to town to watch the San Francisco Giants play the Cubs we were overly impressed with the City of Chicago and the people.
