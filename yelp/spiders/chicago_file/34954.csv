Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our steaks were perfect and we loved the sides -- sugar snap peas with ricotta and mint were a fun, fresh surprise that offset the richness of our meal.  Had to have the corn after reading all the Yep reviews, and yup - it was great!  The only thing I didn't care for was the marrow I added to my steak - personally I would have rendered the fat out of that much longer.  I love marrow but not with 100% of the fat still there too.
