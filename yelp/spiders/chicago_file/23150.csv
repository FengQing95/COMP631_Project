Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////However, once I pulled out a slice..I noticed that there was TONS of cheese just oozing out of it.  Normally, this would be very exciting to me since I'm  a little obsessed with cheese.  BUT, there was just WAY too much cheese in here.  It was like bread and melted cheese.  It was too much.  We actually couldn't even finish one small pizza.  I was totally bummed.
