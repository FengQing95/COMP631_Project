Art Institute of Chicago////This is an awesome Art Institute. It's HUGE and overlooks the park/city so it has beautiful views. The program is laid out so well and organized. We were pressed for time so we referred to the program's "must see" art. It was like a fun scavenger hunt, but we also managed to look at a few things here and there. We went at 1pm on a Saturday. The line for tickets were out the door, but moved very fast. $18 per adult. You can get in for free if you have a annual membership.
