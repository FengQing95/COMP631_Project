Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Got a thin crust pizza delivered and had to cut it myself because the COLD pie had fused back together. The spinach bread was hot and awesome but I asked for parmesan cheese for two people and got nowhere near enough for one child. So start to preheat your oven about an hour into your wait and tell them its for 35 or 40 people to get enough parmesan cheese for two. Â Tastes great. Service is awful.
