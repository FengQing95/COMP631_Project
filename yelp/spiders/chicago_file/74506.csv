Little Goat Diner////I hear great things about the Bulls-Eye French Toast but didn't want sweet so I got This Little Piggy Went to China.  My BF had to be a basic b**ch and got the corned beef has.  WHY AM I WITH HIM.  Anyways, the food came out in a reasonable amount of time.  The piggy was delicious! The sauce has so much flavors & it was STRONG.  The kind where it'll linger on your tongue for a while.  I do recommend you share this dish with someone & share the bulls-eye maybe because it's too much.  Our friend couldn't finish it because it was that strong.  The corned beef hash was meh.  I would say to skip it! As for the Blood Mary's, those weren't crazy good but it was pleasant.
