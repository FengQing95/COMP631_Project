Art Institute of Chicago////Wonderful collection. The miniature gallery is adorable. They have quite a big collection of John Singer Sargent's work. Hopper's Nighthawk is not on display, and the security lady told me that it's almost always gone somewhere else.. but they have so much more to see anyway. The Museum shop is amazing, I would say that it's even better than the one in National Gallery of Art in Washington DC!
