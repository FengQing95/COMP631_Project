Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For my first time in Chicago, I wanted to try a deep dish pizza! Many people and articles recommend Lou's. My experience was good. Customer service was amazing. Everyone was really friendly and helpful. I was seated immediately. They get 5 stars for customer service. Their food is what made me rate it 3 stars. It's OK. The classic deep dish pizza itself was underwhelming. There was a lack of flavor that was being overcompensated with a massive amount of cheese.
