Little Goat Diner////The service is ON POINT! Our waitress was extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and most importantly, came by to check on us throughout the dinner (our glasses were NEVER empty!). We came by on a weekday around 5:30pm and were very lucky to find free street parking on a side street and were seated without a wait.
