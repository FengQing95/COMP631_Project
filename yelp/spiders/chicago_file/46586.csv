Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Vegetarian review--We didn't get the paella, so if I had maybe I'd have been happier. We weren't too impressed. And I was disappointed because it's been around so long and I felt like the only one left who hadn't been there yet. I have to say, when I ordered the roasted peppers I Â didn't expect to just get literally 8 little peppers, roasted. That's it. $6. Seriously. No sauce or even 1 other thing on the plate. That was a condiment, not a dish. The garlic potato salad was ok, but isn't that American grocery store stuff? I only ordered it because I ran out of choices. Didn't say "Spain" to me. The waiter said paella takes 45 minutes...so after the first round its too late for that. Wish i knew that...45 minutes!!! Really? So people wait 45 minutes for a meal here? I was starving still after about 5 shared dishes that were sooo small, so I ordered the omlet. Two of them. They were huge and it was toward the end of the meal...I didn't want an omlet for dinner, but after trying pretty much the whole veggie section, they were they same price as the meat items and there was not enough food. Why on earth would there be an omlet on the dinner menu? Chick pea stew was pretty good and a decent size. They need to get something with some substance on the veggie menu. And get rid of the omlet, it wasnt even very good. But at least it made me full. The good: spicy potatoes, the mushrooms and chick pea stew. The bad: roasted peppers, potato salad, omlet, brussel sprouts salad (no taste). The ugly: $50 each with tip and only getting full because of the omlet. Now, I've been to other tapas places, and they were amazing. This place IMO, is not much, at least for a vegetarian.
