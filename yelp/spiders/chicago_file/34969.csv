Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Juan and Raul took care of us like I was a celeb. Our water was never half empty, they were at our table ever 5 minutes just checking in to make sure we didn't need or want anything and we're friendly and kind enough to answer any question.  If I opened a  steak house I'd first try to steal employees from here. Just top notch and top class.
