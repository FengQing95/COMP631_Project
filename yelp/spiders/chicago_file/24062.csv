Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After finally trying Pequod's and Giordano's, I think Lou Malnati's is by far a step above. Easily the best deep dish pizza I've ever had, and up there as one of my favorite pizza joints overall. Crust, toppings, cheese...it's a perfect balance all around. A must try for anyone visiting Chicago wanting to try a traditional deep dish style pizza.
