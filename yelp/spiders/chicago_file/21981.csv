Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Getting in the place wasn't a hassle. We were sitting down in 5 mins. The server was very courteous and helpful with the menu. Â Don't be surprised by the wait, it's worth it! Chicago style is the way to go. It could've tasted as fantastic as any great pizzeria in the country. What makes it fabulous is the superb butter crust!
