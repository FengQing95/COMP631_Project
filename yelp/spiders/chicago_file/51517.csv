Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////A group of 5 friends and I wanted to get together and catch up so a reservation was made for 8:30 Tuesday evening. When we arrived it was quite busy and the woman at the front explained that there were no tables available at the moment but we would be seated shortly. Totally fine, so we stood near the bar and were immediately offered drinks or anything else while we waited. We had no issue waiting but about 15 minutes after our reservation time, the host was very apologetic and let us know they had not forgotten about us but were waiting one some tables, who had already paid, to leave. We understood, and her sincere apologies and acknowledgement of us was great service in my opinion. She let us know as soon as the table was being prepared for us and said they would take good care of us!
