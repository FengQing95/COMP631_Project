Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Everything a traditional steak house should be! Very nice traditional decor with intimate lighting... maybe a little to dark though for me. First they have the perfect bread assortment sour dough to sweet raisin!. Lets get right down to it the dry aged ribeye has serious flavor!!!!! In every bite steak was cooked perfect and very tender! The bone marrow enhancement i ordered with it wish I would of ordered one of the other "enhancements" they have to offer because it was ok at best. They definitely know what they are doing with steak. Was not a fan of the creamed spinach they do their's different from most places just didnt make my taste buds happy wasn't feeling the onion or seasoning choice... didn't work well together. Overall i give Â a 4 1/2 they have a great service team! i like how its a collective effort from the staff waiting on your table so you get the best service no matter how busy they're. Can't wait to get back!
