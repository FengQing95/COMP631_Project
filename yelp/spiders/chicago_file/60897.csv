Smoque BBQ////First thing I noticed, man was it loud. I felt like I was entering my high school cafeteria, and it was a bit more than half full. I'd hate to hear it at dinner time. I do take it for what it is, while not expecting a candle lit mood, it is a BBQ place, however some art with canvass would help.
