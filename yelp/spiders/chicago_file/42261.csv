Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is my second favorite tapas place!  This place is only out-ranked by Cafe Iberico because I'm slightly biased towards it not being owned by a private owner.  It's great for a group of people.  There have been quite a few happy hours after work at this spot.  They do a 4-6pm Happy Hour that consists of $3 tapas.  They also have a Happy Hour on Saturday and Sunday for a couple of hours as well, but I can't remember the time.  You must get the bacon wrapped dates here and the skirt steak with the potatoes.  The Truffle Chocolate dessert is incredibly rich.  The short ribs are really salty and have a lot of fat.  The service is excellent.  Bear's coach Lovie Smith was also here once, and I'm sure he was quite amused as I turned to look at him 5 times without saying something as he was standing out waiting for his car to be brought to him from the valet service.  It may seem contradictory, but even with the food tasting great, it's missing something that I would deem excellent that Cafe Iberico has.
