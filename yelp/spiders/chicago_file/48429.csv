Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Really enjoyed a romantic dinner for two at Ba-Ba-Reeba. Between the two of us we ordered about ten plates, all of which were great. We especially loved both of the stuffed date dishes (yes, we got stuffed dates twice) and the sangrias. Perfect place for a date, dinner with friends, or if you want to try a little bit of everything.
