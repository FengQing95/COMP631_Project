Smoque BBQ////I ordered the half order of brisket sandwich with a side of slaw and baked beans.  The brisket was fantastic!  Very moist and tasty!  The sauce was good, but seemed like it lacked something that would really give it a good kick.  The slaw was bland and the beans were runny and a little under cooked.  Dissapointing.
