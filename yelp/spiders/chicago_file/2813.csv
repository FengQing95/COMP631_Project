The Purple Pig////Was finally able to secure seating at the bar - had attempt twice before  in the recent past at the new location, but it's still as popular as ever and the space fills quickly in the evening hours, especially weekends. Late lunch, about 2 or so seems to be the best time for experiencing the cuisine and vibrant   atmosphere.
