Smoque BBQ////I ordered the chicken, mac' n cheese, french fries and a corbread muffin.  Holy lord it was amazing.  The rub on the chicken paired with the sauce was perfect and tender.  The mac was a great flavor.  A huge bag of hand-cut french fries were awesome.  And, then the cornbread muffin, mmmmmmmmm, my god.
