Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////This place is hands down my favorite brunch place!!  I don't think I've ever been to a restaurant here in Chicago where I am confident enough to get something new off the menu each time I go and am completely satisfied with the quality (and quantity!) of food.  I've had the Florence Benedict, Mexicana Skillet, and more recently, their Biscuits and Gravy.  It was delish with its fluffy biscuits smothered in their equally yummy sausage gravy.  I always end off the meal with their Honey Toffee Nut Latte to go!
