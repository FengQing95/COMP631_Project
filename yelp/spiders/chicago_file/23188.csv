Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Coming from out of town and was told this is the place to go over the other deep dish places. Servers/Staff was super friendly called ahead to put my name on the list pre-ordered our pizza so we didn't have to wait long, was seated in under 10mins for two ( so maybe call to put your name on the list). We ordered the buffalo wings for an appetizer and OMG the sauce was unlike any buffalo I've tasted and I'm like the Hot sauce queen ! Wasn't too hot but was a mix of hot and mild I can't even explain it just go try for yourself ! The deep dish is what we came for we liked it but not love I think maybe it's just a Chicago thing don't get me wrong it was some good pizza but I think our hopes were high for lots of things we thought it might have been like really deep (and wasn't) the crust was like extra crunchy because of baking in the dish so it was good just not something we "southerners"( me and my partner) were really raving over ! Try this place if your in town visiting
