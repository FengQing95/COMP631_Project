Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This was our first time visiting Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, and we were very excited to try tapas during happy hour. We made a reservation ahead of time as the reviews stated that they are always super busy. When we arrived, we were seated in the dining room. When we asked the server for the happy hour menu, he seemed annoyed and told us very rudely that happy hour is only in the bar and that we had to move. You could tell he was just upset because he was going to lose a table and it was very uncomfortable. Once in the bar area, our server was very friendly and helpful. However, I was not too impressed by the food on the happy hour menu. It was just okay. Next time we will try the paella.
