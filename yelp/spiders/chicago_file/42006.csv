Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our server was awesome........he was on the ball always coming to the table!  Over all, another great experience.  I have never had a bad time here.  It was just the 2 of us but next time I think we'll bring a group and really turn it up a notch!  If you have dinner......and drink your wine.... and you leave not feeling buzzed...........it's your own fault!
