Little Goat Diner////A lot of restaurants that are touted as buzz-worthy tend to be a let down to me; I think a lot of people hype it up because everyone else is and it's trendy.  Little Goat is an absolute exclusion to that--I've never had anything bad here:  service, food, beverages--100% spot-on every single time.  My favorite is the Parathas Burrito, which I crave more than I care to admit.  Also outstanding is the daily bread and soup.  I first tried this bread at Girl & the Goat and swore I never knew bread could be so amazing.  The same bread artisan bakes daily special flavors that are usually paired with 2 amazing toppings--a butter and something else special.  If you think I'm kidding that I have dreams about the bread, well, go see for yourself.  You won't be mad that I dared you.
