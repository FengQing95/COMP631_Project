Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The spinach bread came with a cup of home-made marinara.  It was a good sized individual loaf, with a good amount of melted cheese and spinach inside of a crisp, delicious crust.  A biteful with sauce... YAHHH!!!  Sensory satisfaction!  I ate that slowly, initially thought I'd save some to go, but nope!  It was too good.
