Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The service is always wonderful. The servers are very helpful if you need help navigating the menu. One server even gave us a pro tip when we couldn't decide between sides. He told us that instead of choosing between the truffle mac & cheese and the thick cut bacon, we could get the truffle mac & cheese topped with pieces of bacon! Seriously, great servers.
