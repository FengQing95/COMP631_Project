Smoque BBQ////Went of the sandwich first. Brisket was tasty and juicy, nice smokey flavor with a good spice rub. The sauce was tangy and delicious. Scarfed it all down and moved onto the ribs. The ribs fell apart as I touched them, came right off the bone. You could see a good smoke ring and the spices formed a really nice crust on the outside. Juicy, tender and flavorful. Mac n cheese wasn't very special. Good but not life changing. Cole slaw was really good though. Seemed to have less mayo than normal and more of a vinegary tang.
