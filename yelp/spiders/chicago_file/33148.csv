Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////All in all, this place is a little more pricey and fancy and luxe than Gilt Bar. Ironically, despite the higher prices and finer food, the feel and setup of the place is like a bar with nice booth seating. i.e. Gilt Bar actually has a more proper "dining room" area than this palce.
