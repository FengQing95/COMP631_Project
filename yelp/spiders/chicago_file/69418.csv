Little Goat Diner////The food is greasy diner bliss with fresh ingredients snuck inside. The perfect example is the Los Drowned, which is like a French Dip (served with a side of jus) but with purple onions and what looks like a pickle slaw of sorts. I've also had the patty melt with a goat patty and you can barely tell you're not eating beef because its smothered in excellence. The portions are large and worth the price, even a la carte. You won't want to save your money when you come here anyway because it all sounds so good. You'll be looking left and right wondering what your neighbors are eating.
