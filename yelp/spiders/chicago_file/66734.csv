Little Goat Diner////After our third attempt of trying Little Goat, we finally were able to get a table in a reasonable amount of time. We had the Pork Belly Pancake and Blue Plate Special, which was beef heart with kale and cucumbers in tzatziki sauce on naan. Everything was sooo SALTY. I tried to eat as much as I could, but after a few bites, I was getting full just on chugging water. I decided to try their bakery to balance out the salty meal I had and ordered a Lemon Chocolate scone to go. Unfortunately, the baker must have been taught how to season like the cooks in the diner because the scone was topped with SALT! It was a basically salt scone with a hint of lemon and chocolate. So disappointing, but so glad we didn't wait more than five minutes just to experience this.
