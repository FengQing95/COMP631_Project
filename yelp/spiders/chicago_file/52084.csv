Smoque BBQ////Super, great, awesome, that is how I describe it.  I had the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich.  The BBQ sauce included was great!  Plus a $4 add on of St. Louis Style Ribs.  The ribs were smoked perfectly, and included another BBQ sauce...mmmm....good stuff!  The cornbread wasn't anything to write home about, but everything else was.
