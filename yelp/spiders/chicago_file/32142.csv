Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I am giving Lou Malnati's Pizzeria a 3 Star, and think it's generous. My wife and I were told by friends to try this restaurant while visiting Chicago. We were warned that the pizza takes a LONG TIME to cook and they weren't kidding. We were told to pre-order the pizza when you put your name on the waiting list, which we did. My wife and I pre-ordered our deep dish SMALL pepperoni pizza. We then waited in the bar for 45 minutes before we got seated. We then waited 45 minutes at our table before we got our pizza. While eating our pizza we ordered a small salad (mistake), that took almost 30 minutes to get out to our table. I asked our waitress were our salad was and we were told we didn't pre-order the salad it so it takes awhile. I thought the pizza was good, but by the time we waited to get the pizza we were starving so I'm undecided....Not sure I would go back.
