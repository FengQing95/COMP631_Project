Little Goat Diner////Me and my coworker felt something when we first entered little Goat; something off. We came to the conclusion that it was simply the fact that this place comes across as trying to hard. Hard to buy into a traditional diner experience when the spinning goat on top of the restaurant literally cost as much as the restaurant itself.
