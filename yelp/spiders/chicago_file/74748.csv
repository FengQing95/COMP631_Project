Little Goat Diner////The food... Well. I'm still not sure if I had too high of expectations coming in. We were starving from a small lunch, so we ordered 2 breakfasts and an entree, and a burger. While everything was ...good, nothing we had (shrimp and grits, asian pancake breakfast tasty thingy, korean burger with beef patty, pork belly pancake) was super exciting. Everything seemed kind of one dimensional, actually. I was expecting all these unique dishes to be very interesting. Memorable. Something was missing here that is very distinctly present across the street.
