Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////After the salads, we ordered the entrees.  Since I am not a steak fan, I ordered the roasted chicken with a side of mashed potatoes and my bf ordered the 22 oz. dry aged rib-eye with the creamed spinach.  The potatoes were okay and my bf said the spinach was overwhelmed with the taste of blue cheese, but that didn't stop him from eating the whole thing pretty much.  I enjoyed my chicken.  The portion was large and well priced although I did think my chicken came out cold.  You could taste hints of lemon and the skin was crispy.  My bf said the rib-eye was melt in your mouth and buttery, one of the best he has ever had.  Our dog thought so too since he got to enjoy the left over bone after.
