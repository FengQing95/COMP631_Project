Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Great steak and great drinks. I really think you can go to most of the famous chicago steak houses and get a great steak (Gibson's, smith and wolinski's, david burke, etc). But if you want to get a great steak and eat it in a restaurant that looks like it came out of the most recent episode of mad men, then this is your place. This place is really cool!
