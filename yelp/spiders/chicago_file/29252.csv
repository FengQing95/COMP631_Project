Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When I touched foot in Chicago this was the first deep dish pizza place I tried and I was expecting the crust to be extremely thick, but it wasn't as thick as I thought which was nice.  I love pizza so I eat the entire pizza and the crust wasn't bad.  I tried the pepperoni and cheese and the Chicago classic.  Both pizzas were good, but I really liked the Chicago classic.  I loved the different toppings especially the sausage.
