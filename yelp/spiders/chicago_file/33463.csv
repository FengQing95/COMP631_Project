Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Let me make this clear. I am a steak lover, fanatic, connossieur of sorts you may say. I've been to all of the top steakhouses in New York, which are some of the best anywhere. My standards are extremely high when it comes to beef. After getting a tip from a friend that I hold in very high regard concerning matters of food, I was told this is the best to get the best steak in the city. After eating it, I am hard pressed and happy to say this is one of the best steaks in the country and one of the best I've ever had.
