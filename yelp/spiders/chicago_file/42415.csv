Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////In terms of food - I don't think you can call something "Bacon Mac & Cheese" when it's just a plate of mac & cheese with a slice of bacon on top. Also, is the brick egg supposed to come with a raw egg? When my friend cut through the fried outer layer of his dish, the entire egg was runny, from the whites to the yolk. It was disgusting. And the waiter, while polite and gracious in getting my friend's replacement order, never apologized for an obviously undercooked dish - he seemed to brush it off as typical. My dish (chorizo, manchego, and vegetable omelet) was good enough though. The waffle-battered chicken stick was not impressive - it looked and tasted like a stunted corndog. I would save my $2 for another novelty. My friends who'd been here for dinner couldn't even remembered they'd been here before, and once they did recall that meal, they shook their heads and said we should have picked another restaurant.
