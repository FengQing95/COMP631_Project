Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Nothing is better than Free Food!!! Don't get too excited only free because we had a work breakfast here, which I am always pumped about. We had a group of 6 that went at about 8:30 am and we were able to get right in and sit down immediately, which seems to be a rarity for prime breakfast hour around here. Food was great and came out in about 10 minutes flat. I had the Espanola Omelette, basically a Mexican/TexMex omelette loaded with Chorizo, Chihuahua cheese, jalapenos, cilantro, etc. IT was a gigantic omelette made with farm fresh eggs which make a world of difference. Around the table everyone stuck with skillets or omelettes, will be trying a skillet next time since it is served in a container about the size of a bucket. Great place if you are looking for some great breakfast food that is served fast!
