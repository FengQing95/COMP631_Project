Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My experience started waiting at the bar.  i asked the bar keep for a bourbon drink - just so happens that he was from Kentucky and he "made up" a great drink for me.  Think of a mint julep but without the mint (best way i could describe it).  So good.  We then sat down and were immediately greeted by our service that we so helpful and patient (we had a lively party of 6).  Everything that he described and recommended came thru.  We started with a huge seafood tower (maude tower i think it was called) that had oysters (with East and West coast), lobster, shrimp, and crab legs.  So good and very easy to eat (lobster and crab legs were chopped in small pieces put inside their shells).  I then ordered the 20 dry aged rib eye - wow, a perfect medium rare.  Seared so nice with bits of char and so tender in the middle.  It was a lot of meat but would def order again.  We then shared an array of plates - roasted heirloom tomatoes, mexican fair corn, and seared broccoli.  I really loved the mexican corn but the surprise hit was the simply roasted heirloom tomatoes with herbs.  I could eat all day.
