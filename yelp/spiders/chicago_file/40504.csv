Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It was dark and cozy - super cool ambiance. Blu and Exile were playing overhead. The bartender who waited on me was great. She was tatted up and dressed just right for the setting. She made me a couple of great old fashions, I ordered a crabcake which was all crab, no filler. I couldn't even figure out how it was held together. I had a bone in filet mignon and an order of mac & cheese. All told, including tip, it was about $210.00. Worth every penny!
