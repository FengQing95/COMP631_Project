Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Overall it was an expensive experience that we wouldn't have again. The steak was to die for but that js certainly not enough for us to ever go back. It's funny because they whole time we both were kicking ourselves in the head because gilt bar is right next door and always a far superior experience... Steak isn't as great but the time is always well spent and the staff always makes sure we are comfortable
