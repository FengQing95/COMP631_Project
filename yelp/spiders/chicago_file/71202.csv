Little Goat Diner////Wonderful! My boyfriend and I went here for brunch on a Friday while vacationing in Chicago and liked it so much, we went back for dinner the next night. We arrived around 11 a.m. on Friday and were seated at the counter right away. Saturday night, we'd made a reservation for 10 p.m., but they were able to accommodate us when we arrived at 9. The hostesses both times we went were so genuinely nice.
