Art Institute of Chicago//// Last time I was here, a planned extension abutting Millennium Park by starchitect Renzo Piano had not yet been completed, but renderings look fantastic and feature glass and ceiling panels, and an extending magic carpet floating roof. I'm not sure if it's completed yet (I am lazy to do a quick Google search) but if so, it should be another architectural gem in the Chicago cityscape.
