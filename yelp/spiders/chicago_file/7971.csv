Art Institute of Chicago////I didn't go through the whole museum but really enjoyed the contemporary, impressionist, modern and photography exhibits since it had works from all my favorite artists in those categories. I was a little disappointed that the modern wing wasn't open while I was there and would definitely head back to see if if I were to visit again.
