Little Goat Diner////The decor is great, very bright, airy and friendly staff.  Instead of waiting for a table, we sat at the actual cocktail bar area.  I had the "bibimbap," which uses cauliflower instead of rice. It was interesting.  I can't say I enjoyed it, but to be fair, I grew up eating the traditional Korean version, so I probably wasn't the demographic the dish was aimed at.  The other dish we tried was the OKONOMIYAKI, which was better, but not something I would recommend.  However, I would still be willing to go back and give this place another try.
