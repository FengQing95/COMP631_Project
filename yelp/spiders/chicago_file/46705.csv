Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////- The classic sangria (red), is a hit or miss. Sometimes, it's superb, well balanced with plenty of fruit, but other times it's overly sweet and disappointing. If you'd like more fruit in your sangria, be sure to mention that, they'll usually bring you a side of pre-soaked apples to add to your glass.
