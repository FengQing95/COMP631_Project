Smoque BBQ////I got in my car and then looked at my receipt and it turns out I was given a discount of 10%, not $10, so I was shorted over $6. I debated dealing with it later but then figured it would be more of a hassle, so I did a questionably legal U-turn on Pulaski, re-parked, and went back in, fighting my way through the crowd.
