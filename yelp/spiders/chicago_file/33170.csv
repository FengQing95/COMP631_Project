Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It was a good decision to share everything family-style because I could imagine getting flavor fatigue with any one of the mains. One of the only missteps of the evening was when the waiter, emboldened by our constant chattiness, brought one of our party a drink because it was "his favorite." She didn't enjoy it and told him so, but it stayed on the bill. He did, however, comp us a dessert after we had ordered it. Potato-potata?
