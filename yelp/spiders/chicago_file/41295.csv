Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I know, I know, a lot of people complain about the portion size and prices here, but I have always enjoyed Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba.  The food is consistent, and if you come in a smaller group to sample lots of things and have some of their delicious cava sangria  then you will not leave unhappy.  In the summer, the patio is great.  Choose an off night unless you want to wait--even with reservations.
