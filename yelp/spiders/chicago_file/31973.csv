Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////OK seriously the pizza here was garbage. We came to Chicago and felt like it was imperative to try deep dish pizza. I have better deep dish pizza delivered by Domino's in Renton Washington OK. It was terrible. They have this huge wait and snatch waiters working in there that are rushing you and having a bad attitude. Only for you to sit down and get served a sub par pizza. I'm really disappointed. When I come back to Chicago I will not be going to this place. Trash!
