Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My family came to Chicago with our friend from Germany and we wanted her to really experience all good things Chicago so naturally the deep dish pizza was on the list for dinner.  This placed was recommended to us by a staff member at our hotel and thought we'd give it a try.  The whole thing was awful.  The place was packed and tiny.  Very claustrophobic. We were seated upstairs in an even smaller area by a very rude hostess.  (Just her attitude and the way she talked to us like she really didn't want to be there and we were an inconvenience to her). The waitress really loud and overly sweaty (meh, it happens) but was quick to get our orders and brought us our drinks and plates right away, so that was good, however the plates were filthy with caked on food and finger prints all over them.. gross!  The food came after about 45 minutes later which we expected and it was horrible.  The crust tasted like graham crackers the cheese was really cold which made it very chewy and the sauce consisted of four slices of tomatoes on top of the pizza.  It tasted like a can of tomato paste.  We were sooo bummed this turned out like it did.  I was really looking forward to the pizza especially after reading all the great reviews.
