Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I believe this restaurant is always busy! My friend and I got there at 19h30 and was on waiting list. They took our phone number for them to text whenever the table was ready. They also gave us the menu to preorder pizza only. Appetizers and salads can be ordered on the table.
