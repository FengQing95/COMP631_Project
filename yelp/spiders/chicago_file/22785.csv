Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////What visit to Chicago would be complete without some deep dish? It was my first stop in Chicago and it is clearly the place to be on a Friday night. With an hour wait, I was starving, but they do conveniently let you pre-order your pizza beforehand since it takes 40+ minutes to cook.
