Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The other tapas were a decent size, but not meant for sharing with more than two or three people. Tapas are meant for just getting a small taste of everything, so you may have to order quite a few things. But the prices are reasonable and the food does fill you up more than you would think.
