Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This was one of our stops on a food tour. Had the pepperoni pizza, really enjoyed it a lot. The crust was excellent and the sauce was not sour or acidic. Lots and lots of mozzarella cheese. Very flavorful. Menu is varied and they have salads, pastas, and thin crust pizza. Next time I am in Chicago we are returning for sure.
