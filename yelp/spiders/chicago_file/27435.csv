Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou's is firmly in the Mount Rushmore of Pizza in Chicago.  Their buttery, flakey crust separates their deep dish from your run of the mill Chicago style joint.  Don't sleep on their thin crust either, which is also among the best in the city.  If you're not in a coma after throwing back a few heavy slices, their warm cookie with ice cream is a fantastic desert to cap off what is always an incredible meal.
