Smoque BBQ////Love their sandwiches. They can get messy with the BBQ sauce you put on it, but it's worth it. The line is long and that should tell you something about the restaurant. People love food and will wait for it. The pulled pork sandwich is good and the brisket is great. They give you 2 types of BBQ sauce, Carolina and Memphis style. Carolina style is thicker and tangier while Memphis is more vinegary tasting. Word of advice if your not want to wait in line. Place an order and by pass the line and eat in your car, work or home.
