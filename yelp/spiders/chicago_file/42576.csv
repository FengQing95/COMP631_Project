Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place really is as good as it gets. They have built a solid reputation around variety and service. I have friends and family in town quite frequently and always take them here. They are super foodies and rave about it all the way back to New York etc...I prefer small portions so I appreciate being able to try a little bit of everything. The butterscotch dessert is to DIE for, this coming from a chocolate lover. With a plethora of sangria favorites, you're sure to keep everyone fully hydrated. Great spot for a date or large group.
