Smoque BBQ////Even on a snowy cold day, this place was busy so I can only imagine what it's like when the weather is nice. In those instances, I would order take out for sure. Although it was teeming with people, the host easily found us a seat and overall, the service was incredibly attentive and kind. That always wins extra points in my book.
