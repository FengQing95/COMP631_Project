Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Because of my frequent visits I've tried a good many items on the menu.  All have been spectacular, with the exception of the fried green peppers with coarse salt.  They are literally JUST fried medium hot peppers and pretty boring.  My favorites include the goat cheese croqueta (delicious, delicious molten goat cheese with some candied orange or confit orange on top), the rioja braised short ribs (so irresistibly tender), the escargot toasts, and of course, the bacon wrapped dates.  The portions also seem reasonable for the price and I generally walk away full.
