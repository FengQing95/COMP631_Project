Little Goat Diner////I have been to this restaurant MULTIPLE times and it never fails to impress me.  First off, the coffee here is great - deep roasted flavor that isn't bitter and tastes good with or without milk/cream.  Secondly, whatever you decide to order, just have it with a side of hash browns.  Trust me.  They're delicious, salty, crispy and aren't in the least bit soggy.  I've ordered the corned beef hash twice and that's amazing.  My boyfriend has ordered the Fat Elvis, which wasn't overwhelming in the PB flavor but had a nice creaminess to the dish.
