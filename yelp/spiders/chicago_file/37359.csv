Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////If your guests are looking for expensive steak that are delicious, Bavette is the perfect place for you. More importantly, anything outside steak is just perfect. Oysters are super fresh and they are one of the very best in the cities where seafood are usually poor. Fried chicken is perfection although the price point is one magnitude above KFC's. I don't think you can find anywhere in the city that has fried chicken that is as crunchy and juicy as Bavette's.
