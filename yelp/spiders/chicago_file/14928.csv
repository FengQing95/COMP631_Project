Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Oh my god, there is nothing better in this world than that gigantic burger of a pizza and a beer.  I would've preferred to have been watching football, but at that moment it didn't matter.  All that cheese and sausage and tomato and butter crust was freaking unbelievable!!  I've never eaten anything like that before in my LIFE!  Each bite of pizza was equivalent to like 17 bites of any other pizza.  Coming from L.A. we were like, uhh 2 pieces each that's not enough, and ordered a medium.  No, no my friends, it was FAAAR too much, we could only eat one slice each.  Though we also had the calamari, which is awesome, highly recommend that.
