Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I finally made it here! I went on a Friday night at about 5:15pm. (Senior citizen swag!) My friend and I were initially struck by how dark it was inside - no windows, either. It's very romantic, but it's also a place where you might have to greet people by feeling their faces to make sure it's them.
