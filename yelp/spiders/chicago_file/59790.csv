Smoque BBQ////LOVE LOVE LOVE their BBQ. Went last night around 8:30 p.m. and there was absolutely no line. So unusual!! The BBQ is delicious...smokey ribs, tender melt-in-your mouth brisket, and tasty pulled pork. Love it all, especially all the great sides. Small portions, but it's all you need with the BBQ. I especially love their Peach Cobbler made in house. It's perfectly baked and crispy on the outside with hot peaches cooked on the inside. MmMmm...
