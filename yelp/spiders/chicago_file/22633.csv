Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After trying specialty pizza, and pasta we left extremely disappointed. The pizza was ok but nothing to brag about and there was a taste in the pasta that was absolutely awful. I took 2 bites and was just about gagging. After hearing this place was the best we were super disappointed. The best thing we had was the cheesy garlic bread as an appetizer and the service was good.
