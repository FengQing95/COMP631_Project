Smoque BBQ////We were starving as we head to over to Chicago from Hoffman Estates so we decided to yelp and stumbled upon this place.  We decided to grab some lunch here and wait out for traffic.  Great Find!!! We ordered Sliced Brisket and the full slab of ribs.  Luckily, they allow us to split the full slab for half and half; half slab of Baby Back Ribs and half slab of St. Louis style ribs.  Yummmm!!! The sliced brisket was very moist as well.  I love how they give you many choices of sauce and you get to mix and match with you meat.  The best condiment I found was actually the Candied Jalapeño. I cannot have enough of it.  So good!!!  I know you are probably drooling reading this part as I know I am just typing up this part of my review.  We chose baked beans and fries for the 2 sides.  Baked beans were okay, not bad but a little bit on a sweeter side.  The fries were delicious and the portion was quite generous.
