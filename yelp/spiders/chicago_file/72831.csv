Little Goat Diner////Everyone seemed to really enjoy everything that was ordered! I had a Moscow Goat, which as you might guess, is a Moscow mule, to drink. Drink was pretty ok, but served in a glass instead of a traditional copper mug, which didn't matter in the least, just something I noticed. My husband had a scotch with maple syrup, which he really liked.
