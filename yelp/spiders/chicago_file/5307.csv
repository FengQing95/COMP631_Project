The Purple Pig////The food here was great.  We started the pork chicharrones, grilled broccoli, the cubano, and the stuffed squid.  The chicharrones a bit too crispy - the girls didn't like it.  The cubano was tasty and the spices did not make it too salty.  The grilled broccoli was damn good and the stuffed squid also came with this green sauce, which I adored.  My girlfriend loved it, so I gave her most of my piece - there were only 4 squids in the dish.
