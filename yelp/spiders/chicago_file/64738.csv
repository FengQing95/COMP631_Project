Smoque BBQ////4 words...The Best Brisket Ever.  I think all the 5 star cazillion reviews here are a testament to how popular, authentic & delicious Smoque BBQ is, so I will try to keep this simple.  I have been here twice.  This place is small, and with its growing fan base I imagine at some point they will relocate to a larger space.  They have limited parking behind the restaurant and luckily we found a spot!
