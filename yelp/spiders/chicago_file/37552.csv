Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Halibut: This was a good piece of fish, you can tell the quality of the filet, and the meatiness of the cut. The issue was that it was a bit overcooked. It had an awesome crust on it, but the inside was actually quite dry and flakey. It still tasted good and was seasoned well. But the Fish was pretty much all that was on the plate so there was nothing to help cover up any minor cooking errors. This was an extremely expensive (75 dollars- if I remember correctly) overcooked piece of fish.
