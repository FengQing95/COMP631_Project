Smoque BBQ////This is a BBQ joint done right. A simple menu, quick counter service, and a delicious product. Yeah, the place is freakin' popular, and yeah, they've shoved in as many tables as possible so that people have enough room to eat. It isn't a huge location, and that is half of what makes it great.
