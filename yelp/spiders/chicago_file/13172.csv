Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////my first chicago deep dish.  sure i've had deep dish before, but not an authentic one from the land of the deep dish.  the pie was delectable, and a small was way beyond filling between the two of us.  i was about to order a salad, or appetizer, but decided to hold off as to not spoil my deep dish experience.  i'm glad i didn't because there was no room for anything else in my stomach.
