Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Had lunch here the other day while on a vacation in Chicago. Had the family with me and went to great lengths to state how good the pizza is. While they agreed when we eventually received it 55 minutes after ordering we all agreed worst server we experienced in over 20 years. Just did not pay attention to our table at all. We had to ask several times for drink refills and she gave no status when the food would be ready as we all know it does not take an hour on a weekday at 2:30 pm. Overall, she was NOT pleasant.
