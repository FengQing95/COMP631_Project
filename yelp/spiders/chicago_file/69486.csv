Little Goat Diner////Brandade and belly ($14) was an interesting take on eggs benedict. The square housemade biscuits were amazing - warm, dense, and noticeably loaded with butter in every bite. The kimchi and pickled jalapenos provided the much-needed acidity, fried eggs were perfectly runny. The brandade is an excellent alternative to hollandaise, but I think there was only one small piece of (very tasty) pork belly in the entire dish.
