Smoque BBQ////We were meeting up with some friends in Schaumburg and decided to alter our route a bit to check this place out, after seeing it on the Food Network.  While the stop-and-go traffic getting there made us wish we had stuck with our original route, those regrets were quickly forgotten with the first bites of brisket and pulled pork.  To say that they were tender and flavorful wouldn't begin to do them justice.   The fries were quite tasty, too, and portions for all were very generous.
