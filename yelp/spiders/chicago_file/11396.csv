Art Institute of Chicago////Absolutely gorgeous museum! The last time I visited the Art Institute was when I was in middle school so I couldn't remember what it looked like. I visited yesterday for the first time in forever and I was so impressed with how HUGE it is! From the outside, it looks big but not nearly as big as it actually is on the inside.
