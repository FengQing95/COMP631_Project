Little Goat Diner////I've been here a number of times, whether it be just for drinks, brunch on a Sunday. Etc. This place is in the perfect area of West Loop. Very up and coming area, that has some of the best restaurants. Thoroughly enjoy the food. Especially prosciutto breakfast pizza mmmm!!! I think the only thing is they were slightly overpriced on the bottle service for mimosas. Whereas you can find bottomless options at many places similar to them around the city. That won't stop me from coming back here. Just a thought though.
