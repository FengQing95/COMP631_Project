Little Goat Diner////To start, they have a ton of delicious beers to choose from and a few different cocktails-a mezcal tequila cocktail was ordered as MEZCAL IS AWESOME! However, our drinks coming out were prettyyyyyyyy slow-like we got our appetizer before even getting our drinks. Not too big of a deal, but when the other people I was dining with just ordered beer, it seemed strange. The lobster dip was served with a measley six Ritz crackers, so that was a bummer.
