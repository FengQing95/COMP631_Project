Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////FINALLY tried this place and WOW... such a big fan!! the lamb and couscous is SO flavorful and yummy... the spicy potatoes with whatever sauce they give with it is amazing... coconut flan and their tres leches cake are both so good! Â its super packed... we called at 7 and got the first available reservation for 10:30! .. it was worth the wait. i def recommend this... a great place for a girls night out.. and really good prices too!
