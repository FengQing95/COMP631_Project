Smoque BBQ////I had lived in the hood three years before my dad in Wisconsin had seen this place on some Food Channel show. Â I meet a friend there who was coming from downtown on the blue line (5 min walk). The menu is written on a board on the wall so you would think people would be looking while waiting in line, not always the case.
