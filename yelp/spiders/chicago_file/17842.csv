Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I had a horrible experience today. I ordered online and received confirmation that my order was taken at 11:45 AM. My cold pizza arrived at 1:40 PM. This was especially annoying because when you order you see a little video about how great Lou Malnati's cheese is. The owner was showing how great the cheese was, but I only got cold clumps of cheese. Â And there was just no love, no effort whatsoever put into this flavorless cold pizza. The small deep dish was about $23 with delivery. A complete waste of money and 2 hours of my time.
