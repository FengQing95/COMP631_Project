Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The Tapas Monster returns to one of the oldest tapas spots in Chicago. Yesterday was a bit of a reunion and a nice night out on the town with old friends. I've become addicted to the Spanish cuisine for about two months now and knew that tapas would make for the best choice to go out for. Enter Cafe Ba Ba Reeba.
