Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Was there with a group of 7 and had the most amazing service, by the end of the night some how my cell phone had slipped behind the built-in booth (7 bottles of wine might of contributed).  The staff and especially manager went above and beyond their way to make sure that my phone was retrieved the following day by having the booth taken apart.  Just fantastic service and especially Food - can't ask for more!
