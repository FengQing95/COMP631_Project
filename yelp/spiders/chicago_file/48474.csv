Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been going here for years and went with my girlfriend last night. Ba-Ba-Reeba is a legit tapas spot; never earth-shattering but always good. The staff is friendly, the service is good, the environment is nice and the food is consistent. Â Last night we had the beef empanadas, chorizo pinxos, a beet salad (special with blue cheese and grapefruit), the scallops, shrimp and the orange sangria.
