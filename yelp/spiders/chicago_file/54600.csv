Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Loved this place for brunch!! Will definitely be going again. Was only disappointed by my deviled egg order.... it was the tiniest HALF of deviled egg I've ever seen and I paid and immediately felt sad that I had paid $2.50 for half a mediocre deviled egg. Don't order the deviled egg haha. Everything else was great though! Was expecting the tapas to be a little bigger in general. Order the tortilla -- probably the most bang for your buck. Would highly recommend getting the paella and splitting it amongst 3-4 people - this was my favorite of the 4 things I ordered.
