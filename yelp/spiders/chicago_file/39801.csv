Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Was a little disappointed here I think it was rated number 1 we try a new steak place every year in Chicago it was ok. Just expected a little more I guess. Crab cakes ok , steak ok. They brought all the food out at once and you had an 1:45 min time limit because of the restrictions, and I didn't mind that. They did include a 4% Covid surcharge which you were not told either.
