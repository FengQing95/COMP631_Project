Smoque BBQ////When we finally got to the cashier I ordered the brisket, corn bread and mac and cheese. Number 72, number 73.... number 74. Finally! I don't think I will ever forget that first bite of brisket- it was so tender and juicy that it melted in my mouth. I was not really a fan of the sauce they gave with the brisket, but the brisket was seasoned so well I didn't miss the sauce. Their mac and cheese was also excellent.
