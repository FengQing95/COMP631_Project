Smoque BBQ////The only reason I'm not giving Smoque a 5/5, is because I just went to Real Urban BBQ in Highland Park, and decided that the expression "Woohoo! As good as it gets!" that comes with a 5-star review would be misleading. Real Urban BBQ is better than Smoque, but only slightly, and not if you care about that "smokey" flavor.
