Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Honestly, I don't know what luck I had coming here when I did because my partner and I got seated right away, no wait, around 5 pm on a Saturday! There is always a great debate as to which place has the best deep dish in the city. In my opinion, Lou's classic deep dish is just the perfect melange of cheese, sauce, sausage, and a delicious buttery crust. The buttery crust seems to be a point of contention but I would say that it is what makes Lou's better than the rest.
