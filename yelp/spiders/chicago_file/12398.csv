Art Institute of Chicago////I love museums and love to visit them in many of the cities I visit. This was an absolutely fabulous experience. The layout if the exhibits were perfect and we were able to see many different genres of artwork from impressionism to American modern and many others...Many famous works were represented. The miniature rooms in the lower level were interesting as well!
