Little Goat Diner////Place was packed. Was told an hour and 30 mins wait. At least they face us an option to sit at the community table. We sat at the end of table close to breakfast bar. We were luckily enough to see Stephine Izard owner make our food. Had fillet O fish sandwich, goat chili, Mac and cheese, and Reuben sandwich. Food ok, recommend goat chili and Reuben sandwich. Mac and cheese not gooey enough for me. Fish sandwich bread was a bit too hard to eat.
