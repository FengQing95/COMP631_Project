Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Using Yelp check in we had a 5 minute wait instead Â of 25 minutes (did get glares when we skipped ahead the others waiting though). The service was wonderful, we got our food probably 10-15 minutes after ordering and it did not disappoint, especially for the lower prices. Would definitely come back!
