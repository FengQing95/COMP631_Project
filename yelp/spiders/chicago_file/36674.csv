Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Went here for ny golden birthday dinner and it was absolutely amazing. The filet mignon melted in my mouth as i slowly began melting into my seat. I had a side of the mac and cheese which was a perfect compliment to the steak. The goat cheese appetizer was the tastiest goat cheese I've ever had. By the end of the meal i could't tell if my belt was going to be able to sustain itself. Although I was completely full I got ice cream anyways and that was the end of my belt. Had to ask the waiter to throw it out. Overall 5/5 and would high recommend this place!
