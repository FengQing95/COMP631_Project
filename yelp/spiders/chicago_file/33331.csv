Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Dinner choices were varied but we were both looking for steak so I don't remember too many of the other options.  I went for the steak frites au poivre style which came with very nice fries and peppery steak. The stars start getting deducted here.....I ordered medium rare and got medium at best.  Still it was tasty and had a nice texture.  My brother got the fillet also medium rare....at first I thought his was over cooked a bit also but it may just be it had been allowed to rest (which is proper) and just wasn't dripping juices.  Both came with a bernaise sauce that was a tasty addition.  I ordered cream spinach which was a cheesy baked variety with lots of flavor while brother got the roasted tomatoes, big beefsteaks which blew us away with their simple tastiness.  Bottom line on the steaks perhaps you should ask your server about the house interpretations of done-ness or order a little rarer than you like.
