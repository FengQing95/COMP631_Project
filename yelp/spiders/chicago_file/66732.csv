Little Goat Diner////So was really excited to try this place based on the Girl and the Goat and the reputation.  I am a little bit of a coffee fan and like to find the best cafes where ever I am and have found some real gems and Chicago has a few.  I love the food as this place really made me smile from that stand point but the coffee could have been better.  I love Stumptown but as with all cafes it is really dependent on the barista in control of that shot or pour over and that can make all the difference.   In this case it was rushed and really didn't have any taste whatsoever but that doesn't mean it won't be stellar next time so we are sticking with a 4 star for now!
