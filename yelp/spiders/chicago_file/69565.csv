Little Goat Diner////I am not a huge fan of celebrity chef restaurants but Stephanie Izard did a nice job with the little goat. A menu full of comfort food favorites with just enough of a twist to make the experience special. The fried chicken was perfectly cooked. It was crispy and juicy. The chicken is definitely the star with very flavorful meat. I would assume she uses free range birds with a bribe. It's tough to give chicken this much flavor. Also had the scallops on a sweet potato purée. The dish was perfectly seasoned and a nice balance of savory, sweet and tart.   Lastly I will comment on the pork fat ice cream.  It's normally served in a shake but I had just a scoop. This is certainly a new and unique take on ice cream with Izard further showing how simple comfort food can still be different and interesting.
