Smoque BBQ////At the time, they did have a few Covid precautions in place as it pertained to delivery.  Originally, we were planning to have someone set up the chaffing dishes and food for us, but that option was still not available at the time of our event.  Not a problem though as I very much respected the precautions put in place to protect their staff.
