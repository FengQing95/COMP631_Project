Smoque BBQ////So delicious!!! Everything on the menu is great but my usual is the brisket with macaroni and cheese and I ALWAYS get the peach cobbler! Â Great staff and even better food. Great place to take out of town guests or friends from the suburbs as this establishment has be recognized on many food TV shows.
