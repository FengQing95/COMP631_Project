Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Best pizza I have ever had. Scratch that, best meal I have ever had. Had the Chicago special. Perfect ratio of cheese and sauce. Sausage is flavorful. We had it delivered and it came steaming hot. This pizza is the definition of Chicago deep dish. The other pizza spots are good, but this place is memorable. Order the special, you will not be disappointed.
