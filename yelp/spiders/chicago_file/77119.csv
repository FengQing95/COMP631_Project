Little Goat Diner////Delicious brunch! We started with sharing the giant cinnamon roll. Wow that was incredible, and huge! I'm not usually an icing person but it was perfectly sweet. I got the Spanish omelette and he had the omelette of the day which was like a kimchi style omelette with mint, cilantro, onion etc. Mine was so good- the masa chips on top were new for me and really tied it all together. His was so unique but really enjoyable. The crispy onion straws mixed with the mint were so good! Overall the portions were large and we were deliciously stuffed when we left. The vibe of the restaurant was fun and it had a really pretty open ceiling that let the natural light in. Great place for a weekend brunch!
