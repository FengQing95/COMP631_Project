Little Goat Diner////Much nicer than any other diner. Ordered the pork belly scallion pancake & it was delicious!! Friend ordered the okonomiyaki which was absolutely bursting with flavor. Food was an 11/10 would highly recommend. Nice diner aesthetic. However, it was rather loud and hard to hear. Service was slow as well. Would give 4.5 stars!!!
