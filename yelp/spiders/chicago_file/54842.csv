Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////*** Note*** they offer half pitchers here, so if you get two glasses of sangria you may as well ask for a half for a dollar more. The bartender neglected to inform us when we purchased two glasses waiting for our table. This pissed me off once I found out, but otherwise I had a great time.
