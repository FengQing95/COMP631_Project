Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We loved this place. It is such a vibe! It's like a speakeasy, good music, and really great service! The food is amazing. They give you house made sourdough...omg I love bread more then anything and it might have been the best bread I have ever had. We started with the goat cheese which honestly We love goat cheese but it was heavy and would have been a great appetizer if it was the only thing we were eating, but we were preparing for a lot of food. We had filets (which they give you seasoned salt which is so good!!) and sides. The broccoli, asparagus, mashed potatoes, and truffle Mac. It was all so good. For two people we ordered way to many sides. It was all very good. The vide really is just so amazing here. We are so glad we came, it was an amazing start to our vacation.
