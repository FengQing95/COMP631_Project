Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////its about time i write a review for this place. its mmm mmm good! who said nyc makes the best pizza? well...maybe they're right. but chicago is not too far behind. ordered malnati salad, thin crust sausage and mushroom and deep dish and my foodie friends couldn't stop talking about the goodness factor. ingredients are super fresh. dine in and delivery service is fantastic! would recommend this to a tourist or a local any time of day.
