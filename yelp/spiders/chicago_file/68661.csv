Little Goat Diner////Great food, especially the gluten free bread which was among the best I ever tried. Tasty cocktails, on the pricey side ($12). The service was a little slow for a Monday lunch. Our server really pushed sides, drinks and desserts which is a bit of a pet peeve for me. But can't fault the food. We all cleared our plates. The decor is also classy and stylish.
