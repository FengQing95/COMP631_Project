Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I applaud the staff at Ba-Ba-Reeba, both front-of-house and back-of-house. It is a well-tuned machine that operates efficiently amidst all the chaos. Great service, great food, great memories. If you haven't tried Spanish food, Ba-Ba-Reeba is a great place to go. Have guests coming into Chicago? Hot date? Casual night out? Whatever the occasion, Ba-Ba-Reeba is sure to please.
