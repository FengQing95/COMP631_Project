Smoque BBQ////This place only deserves 5 stars and nothing less.  I've been here countless times. Everything is amazing here, but my go-to is always the sliced brisket platter with amazing fries, amazing Mac n Cheese and amazing beans.  Oh, I'm not a cole slaw guy, but this cream-less slaw is amazing also. If you like more of a kick, ask for jalapeños and they'll give you the S.O.S for your brisket. Ribs are great, chicken is great and Texas sausage is great. Their corn bread is delicious and the peach cobbler warms the heart and closes the deal.  The staff has been there for a while and are super friendly.  Everyone is great here. Thank you Smoque for being in Chicago and adding to the great variety in this great city....oh and it's BYOB...can't ask for anything more!
