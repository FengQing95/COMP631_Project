Smoque BBQ////I had the 1/2 pulled pork and 1/2 chopped brisket sandwich. They were out of coleslaw, so they gave me my one side (really good crunch flavory fries) and threw in a peach cobbler for free. The cobbler may have been the best part of the meal - save room. As my friend noted, they use real peaches, not Del Monte fake ones.
