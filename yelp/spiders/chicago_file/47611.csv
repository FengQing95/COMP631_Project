Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Got bad service, I walk in to pick up food and nobody greeting or ask. I tried to tell somone that I come to pick up food. Somone walked to me, " I'm a manager, could you waiting far away. I'll tell you when it's done" The food was sitting there waiting to be packed, after manager packed the food still siting there without telling me like 10 minutes. Was waiting for food like 20 minutes.. Well, street parking isn't safe, that is why people want to pick up fast and leave.. don't want to try this place !!
