Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is alright for like a first date.  The food is ok not exceptional.  You can however always count on it having great service and the food will always be cooked well.  The main reason for that is because it is a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant and they always have their stuff together no matter what.
