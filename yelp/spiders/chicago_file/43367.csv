Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The only complaint I had was about the seating this time around. Â We were in kind of a dark corner that just didn't seem as vibrant and fun as the rest of the place. the company I was with more than made up for that, naturally, but I'd like to see them exert the same decor effort throughout the restaurant.
