Smoque BBQ////Surprisingly I actually tried this place catered the first time around. I was blown away that catered food could be this moist and delicious. I'm a HUGE cheese lover, thus I always go for the mac and cheese and almost any BBQ joint. It's sad how my first experience with Smoque included a TRAY of mac and cheese. Sadly when I went to dine in I only got a small tin and ended up ordering 2.
