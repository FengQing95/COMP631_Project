Little Goat Diner////Man....who knew diner food could get classy. Thats exactly what the Little Goat does. What amazing spins on classic diner foods. The place is very unpretentious.....I typically have an issue with uppety and hipster places, since I am neither. I like good old unpretentious food. Its really hard to find a place like that in Chicago. I think :Little Goat does just that. The decor is that Â of a typical diner....but the food certainly has a wonderful fine dining flair to it. Very typical diner fair but really impressive and unexpected twists. I would recommend trying the place out if you are a fan of diners.
