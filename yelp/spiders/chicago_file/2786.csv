The Purple Pig////We got the calamari antipasti which was solid and decent portion size. The rabbit gnocchi was fantastic! And of course we got the milk braised pork shoulder like everyone else does. It was a toss up between 1 more dish of food or dessert. We decided to get dessert and it did not disappoint. WE got their popular Sicilian Iris. It was phenomenal. Every bite was perfectly sweet and mouth watering. I would come back here just to get this. But make sure you get there early if you want it as they usually sell out after 8-9.
