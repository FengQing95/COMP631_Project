Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I can't even begin with how much I love this restaurant. My friend and I came here for New Year's Eve and had the best time ever! I really like how everything is laid out in this restaurant. It's dimly lit - it's great for nice dinners out or casual dinners. It's tapas so obviously the portions are going to be small. We ordered Spinach & Manchego-Stuffed Mushrooms. They had an incredible amount of flavor. I can still remember how good they tasted. We also ordered Shrimp with Garlic, Olive Oil, Red Pepper Flakes which was great with all the bread we had. We also got a chicken paella. The tapas may be small portions but the paella is massive! The lady actually took the paella off our check because it was delayed in coming out. I've been to Spain and I have had paella there! This paella is so good, it reminded me of Spain's. My friend ordered their white peach sangria and said it was really refreshing. She couldn't taste the alcohol but it did hit later on. I was impressed with the selection of sangrias. There were so many flavors. The same goes for their dinner menu.
