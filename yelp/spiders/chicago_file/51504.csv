Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been coming here for years and this was the first time where I've honestly felt no need to come back to eat. The sangra is great and our waitress was a dear. When our food (over cooked dates that were thrown on our table) we spoke to the team and they were kind enough to understand the situation. The service here has gone down hill in the last year or so and the tapas are hit or miss.
