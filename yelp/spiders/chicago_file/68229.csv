Little Goat Diner////I used to be a regular for breakfast snacks and a coffee in the morning. had scones to parfaits everything was good, but very over priced. There isn't much on the street that is open at that time so choices are limited. I still have it on my list to visit for a sit down meal, everything always looked delicious, but I would probably take the walk to colombo or starbucks for just a coffee fix.
