Smoque BBQ////Once I waited in the line...which moves rather quickly, I was so excited to finally get the smell of BBQ sauce wafting up my nose, that momentarily, I forgot what I came there for! Yes...the Beef brisket! It was ok. Not great. J. It was smoky and hard at the same time. The sauce was the saving grace to making this edible. (Actually...I went home and tried to soften it up by adding a bit of water and simmering it with their sauce.) The cole slaw...ehhh...not as good as most mom & pop delis. When the cashier hit me with the price, I almost fainted. This "lovely", almost self serve place did not fill me Â with any kind of excitement, nostalgia for dad's BBQ, nor that warm welcoming feeling that makes me feel like I want to "Come again." So...I won't.
