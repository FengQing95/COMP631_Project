Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came here while visiting Chicago on vacay. You have to get deep dish in Chicago right?!  The wait was long so be warned but it really played well onto the suspense. Only good places have long wait times! Unfortunately I'm docking two stars for pre order service. (We had to wait an additional 45 min after our almost 2 hour wait for a seat...) The host informed us that we could pre order our pizza in order to expedite our order and we obliged. (Take a lesson from us and make sure to confirm your name and that the order was placed). Well as you expect, our order never went through... So.. 3 stars for service/experience but..  The deep dish Pizza was great :)
