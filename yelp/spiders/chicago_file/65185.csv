Smoque BBQ////I have yet to visit a restaurant that serves a decent mac n cheese. The noodles are always too soft and too girthy for my taste. Smoque rates the same, and like other restaurants, nails the crusty top and an actual perfect pairing of cheeses, boosting that cheesy punch we all look for in this classic American pasta dish. I ended up scooping most of it on top of the brisket, so my sandwich had cheese. It must be a faux pas to ask for cheese on top of your barbecued meat. I certainly did not see it as an option to add cheese to your sandwich on the menu. It really made the sandwich.
