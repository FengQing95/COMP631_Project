Smoque BBQ////Loved this place. Awesome, awesome, awesome bbq. My fiancee wasn't really too impressed, though. I had the half brisket sandwich, added a sausage, had the baked beans and the cole slaw. I loved how the slaw wasn't a mayo based but more vinegar. The baked beans were really tasty as well. We also had the mac and cheese which was ok and the corn bread, to which my fiancee stated was the best thing we had, it was really good.
