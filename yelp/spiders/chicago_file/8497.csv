Art Institute of Chicago////My favourite painting is here! And I finally got to see it after waiting over a decade!!! My life is complete!!! Seurat's masterpiece that took 5 years and multiple drafts (which I already saw at the MOMA) resides right here and takes up an entire wall. Besides, there are plenty of other (post-)impressionism works by Monet and Renoir. A couple Van Gogh's, multiple Picasso's. A multitude of contemporary artists and the famous american gothic piece!!!
