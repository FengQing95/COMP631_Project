Smoque BBQ////...and I was back for the brisket, and it ROCKS.  I felt as though I owed them an update after they catered my wedding in September.  I just wanted to say that they were awesome.  They were right on time and everything was just as we imagined it would be.  Tons of rave reviews about the food.  If you're looking for something a little more fun and much more delicious for your event I would definitely recommend Smoque.  The only thing I would say is that they somewhat overestimated the amount of food we needed.  Not that I'm complaining... we froze bags of meat and macaroni and sauce and will be eating Smoque for the rest of the year.  :)  Thanks guys!!
