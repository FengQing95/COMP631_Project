Little Goat Diner////I really like Little Goat!  I've been a few times and have loved every meal I've had - everything from the cinnamon roll to the the toastados. The servers are friendly and helpful in describing all the dishes.  I seem to bring all my out of town visitors here and they have all enjoyed their meals.  The Parathas Burrito is probably one of my favorite things.
