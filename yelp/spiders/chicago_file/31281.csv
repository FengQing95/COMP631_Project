Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Service was great but the food was just ok to me. I was kind of disappointed to be honest. The wings tasted just like buffalo wings and there was nothing special that differentiated it from others. The Moscow mule was great and my personal favorite for a hot day in the summer. So refreshing! Onto the pizza, we ordered a personal deep dish pizza because we wanted to try more places in Chicago and didn't want to get too full. There was little flavor in the sauce and was not my favorite. I did eat here once before and got a medium sized pizza and there was more cheese in it so I could see why the personal deep dish sized wouldn't be able to hold that much cheese. Personally my favorite type of pizza is thin crust after eating both deep dish and thin crust. It was kind of disappointing since this place was one of the more famous pizza places in Chicago.
