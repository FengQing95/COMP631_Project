Smoque BBQ////I couldn't help but get a bit everything the first time.  The brisket was as good as I remember from Texas.  The ribs came easily off the bone but weren't soggy with too much sauce. The chicken came out of the oven black as night but was as tender and white on the inside as Britney Spears.
