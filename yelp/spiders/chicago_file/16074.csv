Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The interior is typical Chicago-casual-sports-bar-hangout-eatery venue, with the walls lined with Chicago sports legends.  Also, LM serves alcohol, which is different from other popular pizzerias.  This places gets packed, so you will likely have to wait (30-40 min) to be seated, so plan accordingly.
