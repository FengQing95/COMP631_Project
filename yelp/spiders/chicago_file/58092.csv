Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////100% go here- right this second! Super fun atmosphere and DELECTABLE food! The staff is all wonderful from their wait staff to their bus staff! We had a 11 mo old and the staff all treated her so nicely and were so helpful! The food is so different- I would suggest just getting a bunch of different things and sharing with the table! Such a fun culinary experience- can't wait to go back!
