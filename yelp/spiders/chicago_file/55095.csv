Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I had planned to take group of 4 from Boston out to dinner at another restaurant but changed my plans when I got a text offering $1 Pintxos and $3 tapas and 1/2 price cocktails in the bar. So I thought, I'd take them to Ba-Ba-Reeba instead. Â A group of my friends and I go frequently for Sunday brunch and the service and food is always fabulous.
