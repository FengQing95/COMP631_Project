Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were downtown for the festival of lights parade and stopped in for a few pies. It was amazing. The pizza order was taken before we sat down and after being seatied to our table about 45 min. later, shortly the pizza's came out. They we fresh, and tasty. I will definitely be back for more.
