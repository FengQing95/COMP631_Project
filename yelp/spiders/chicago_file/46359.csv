Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////While we were there, the place filled up quickly; many of the tables had babies and small children.  It made me realize the difference between raising kids now and when I raised mine where we took them to fast food restaurants.  The restaurant was really good with the kids, kudos to Lettuce for making their restaurants more kid friendly.  The babies fussed and cried but it just made us laugh cause it wasn't our problem!
