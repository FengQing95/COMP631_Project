Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////All Chicagoans know that pan is not the way pizza is in Italy.  Now that Chicago has so many types of pizza, the comparisons and arguments are way off.  Comparing Neapolitan pizza to Chicago pan pizza is like comparing lace to denim. Way back, Chicago had thin pizza (yummy cheesy, choose your own topping,  piping hot, sometimes corn meal on bottom) and Italian Bakery pizza (yummy, only sold in pieces, tomato sauce, maybe a little cheese on top, and maybe sausage. Then in the 60's we started up with pan pizza; first was Uno's & Due's, then Lou Malnati's. Malnati's was better right from the get go; others soon followed, and Chicago pan became our "it" pizza.  If you want the best Chicago style pizza, Malnati's is the place- several locations these days. Pan pizza carries out great-if you carry out, don't have it cut- stays hotter! (I also order it well-done and I get the "butter crust"-no worries, it's not butter. ) BUT, I LOVE the Randolph street location- the outdoor area is one of the nicest in the city, and, the rehab Malanti's did inside brought out the best of the old warehouse- a gentleman's bow to an old, hard-working Chicago dame-  and, miraculously, the parking is free. Near the Madhouse on Madison. TVs on with sports, full of Chicago sports paraphernalia. And, the lasagna's great, too.
