Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Very nice establishment.love the dark intimate look.drinks were good,had the gimlet and another "dark" drink.the shrimp dejongh is to freaking good,it could be brought as the main meal as far as im concerned twice.the spiced chicken is ok..to bad they are using thigh meat now making it tough to eat.the steak was top notch quality meat with a nice flavor.will be there quite often.
