Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My friend has historically disliked deep dish, but he thoroughly enjoyed his Malnati order. Like him, I disliked this style of pizza back home on the West Coast because it always felt like eating a bottle of Prego was dumped onto a loaf of bread. I tried a personal sized Classic with no cheese here and enjoyed the hell out of it--I wasn't even eyeing the cheesy pizzas at my table with envy while I ate my delicious monstrosity. The crust, sausage, and tomato sauce still make for a great Chicago deep dish experience. The personal size pizza servings are equivalent to about two small slices.
