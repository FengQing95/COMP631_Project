Art Institute of Chicago////So much to see! It is huge. Spent 3 hours here and still didn't see everything. We started off with the Asian exhibit and moved through the African and Native American sections (some of my faves). The Islamic Architecture and Design was on the lower level and it was smaller than I anticipated, but still nice. I also enjoyed the Modern Art, Impressionism, and all of the notable pieces listed on the back if the guide. If you are short on time, these are provided so that you can see the most famous artwork displayed. I like how specific the locations are for each item: giving a floor and numbered section for easy access. When viewing the sitting Buddha, Peggy was kind enough to chat with us and enlighten us about it and its history. Shoutout.
