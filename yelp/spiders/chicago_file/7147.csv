Art Institute of Chicago////Been there once. You hear about Louve and Metropolitan all the time, but you don't hear as much about The Art Institute of Chicago. I didn't know about it until I was dragged into the place. The place is gigantic and houses many many great arts from different cultures/eras/countries. If you are visiting Chicago, this is a must see place imo.
