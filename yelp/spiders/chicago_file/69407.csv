Little Goat Diner////Overrated.  Granted I ordered very simply since I had a full day of eating ahead of me, but wasn't really impressed with what I ordered or with the menu in general.  I kept it simple with some fried eggs and a cinnamon roll.  The eggs were good...simple...can't really go wrong with those.  The cinnamon roll was just OK.  For a place with a bread shop attached to it, I thought it would be exceptional.  My friend got a omelet with bbq pulled pork, which was good, but very very heavy.  I did love the latte I got at Little Goat Bread next door while we were waiting for our table.
