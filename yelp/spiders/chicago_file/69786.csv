Little Goat Diner////My wife and I enjoyed an excellent brunch today at Little Goat; I was really impressed with how smooth everything operated for such a new venue. The space is nice; a large open room with an assortment of seats and windows looking out to Randolph Street. Stephanie Izard was in house and visible in the open kitchen (perhaps the best seats in the house are some bar stools looking directly into the kitchen). About the only knock on the space is tables are a tad small (but manageable) and as the venue will almost always be full (outside of off peak hours) it is a little on the noisy side; there were also lots of families with young children and infants adding to the din.
