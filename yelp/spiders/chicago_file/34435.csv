Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////First, Ambiance: absolutely perfect. I've been to a lot of the Chicago 1920's speak-easy places, but none have done it as well as Bavette's. The bar in the back of the dining room is particularly cool. I also love the mirrors with the painted menu items written on them. I couldn't help but continue to oogle at the restaurant throughout the meal. The booths are also exceptionally comfortable.
