Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The service is fantastic. Knowledgeable, yet not show-offish. Never pushing for upsells, and treating every guest like a valued client. Attentive, but not disruptive. Hip and modern but with attention to the old-school details - placing silverware, clearing plates systematically, etc.
