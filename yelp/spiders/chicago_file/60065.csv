Smoque BBQ////Baked beans were as good as they get, nice hickory flavor, bits of bacon and pork included and a hint of sweetness via brown sugar and other seasoning, incredible.  Cole slaw (included in all platters) was probably some of the freshest i've encountered, light dressing (not mayo based) which I can only compare to my Mom's homemade Poppyseed dressing...again 5/5!
