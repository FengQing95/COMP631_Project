Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Obviously, the food at Bavette's is worth the hype. The steak is easily the best steak in the city, the bread is INCREDIBLE, and the fried chicken was to die for. I couldn't hype up the food more. I went for my birthday dinner and, due to the difficulty getting a reservation, had to book outside. It was extremely cold out, so I called and asked the host if there was any availability inside. They didn't have any, but just 30-ish min later he called me back and said they'd had a cancellation and would put us inside. I really appreciated this courtesy. They sat us in the basement which was cozy and romantic, but this may just be because covid has forced them to have lower capacity seating. My only complaint is the service from our waitress. As a former server, I try to be understanding, but I saw her ask each table around us what they were celebrating, and each table had a birthday and got to blow out a candle. She never asked us what we were celebrating, what the occasion was, etc. Perhaps I am being high maintenance, but after a year of COVID and not getting to celebrate my birthday, graduation or anything this past year, I was excited to blow out a candle at a restaurant (silly, I'm sure). Â It just didn't feel special. She also was inattentive, didn't come by often, and there were 15-20 min where we had no drinks or food in front of us, which was annoying when there is a time limit for eating. Perhaps they don't have enough servers but I just felt a little neglected considering the cost of the meal, she was rude, and it didn't make for a great birthday. My SO tried to flag her down to tell her it was my birthday, but she never came by.
