Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've been to Chicago once before and had Giordanos and absolutely loved their pizza. I was going to go visit them again because I knew I'd enjoy myself and it would be a no fail dining experience. Â Of course I had to reference my fellow Yelpers and see what they had to say since I haven't been here for about 7 years. I'm glad I went off my plan and took the "risk" of trying Lous.
