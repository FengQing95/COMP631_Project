Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The only things I can think of that could be done to improve is make the pizza more flavorful. The crust was bland, so some seasonings such as salt, butter, or olive oil in that might be helpful. Fresh, high-quality ingredients and seasonings would create better flavors in the rest of the pizza. The best pizzas have chewy, slightly sweet crusts.
