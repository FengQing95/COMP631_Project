Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First time in Chicago, of course I had to try a deep dish pizza. Yelped it and decided to try this place. On a weekday lunch, got seated immediately outside. I had the smallest deep dish original pizza. They warned me it would take 20-30 minutes and I said fine. The best things in life cannot come easy.
