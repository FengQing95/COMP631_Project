Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Meal comes with free bread, and I was able to avoid stuffing myself with bread. BUT I did try a couple bites and it had a subtle, tangy flavor that I really liked. Friend also ordered the peach sangria. Tried a sip and it was good - didn't taste overwhelmingly of alcohol. She also ordered the caramelized banana for dessert and it was great as well.
