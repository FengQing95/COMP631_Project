Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////While visiting Chicago for work I knew that I needed to try an authentic deep dish pizza so I turned to Yelp to find recommendations near my hotel. Lou Malnati's had a number of good reviews so I made sure to add it to my list. I've never had deep dish pizza before so I have nothing to compare it to. I ordered it to go and it took about 30 minutes for my order to be ready, which I had been warned about. At first glance the pizza seemed a little small to feed one person but listen to the recommendations! It was the perfect size and maybe even more than enough for me. I'm not sure how the crust should taste so I feel that I can't adequately comment on that. The quality of the cheese seem to be of a lesser quality than what I'm used to. Most striking to me was that there is no sauce but rather crushed tomatoes over top of the cheese. Overall, I want to say that my three star review is not a reflection of Lou's Â pizza but rather a reflection that my preference is not for deep dish pizza. Sorry Chicago!
