Art Institute of Chicago////Best field trip ever!!! Our 9 mo old and 2.5 yr old had the best time exploring. We probably spent about 4 hours here and the kiddos couldn't get enough. Not to mention everything was family friendly so we didn't have to stress about fitting the stroller somewhere or changing diapers. We can't wait to go back!
