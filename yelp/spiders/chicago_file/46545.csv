Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ordered a lot of stuff, but nothing really stood out to me like the Potatoes & Eggs Benedict (Beef Tenderloin)...honestly this was amazingly good.  We also ordered the Buttermilk-Fried Chicken Thighs.  This one is deceiving, mostly because it is little boneless chicken tenders with a buffalo sauce on them.  Also, pretty darn good.  Now, if they just said "Buffalo Buttermilk Fired Chicken Thighs" instead of being super fancy, then I think a lot more people would be intrigued to try this.
