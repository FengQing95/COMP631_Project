Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm probably breaking an unwritten rule by writing this review but I don't see what all the hubbub is about. I think my expectations were too high. Our pie was good, not great. There was way too much cheese on it, so much that I had to take about half off and it was still plenty. I did like the ability to order online. I was on my way to Midway to catch a flight and didn't have time to order onsite. As promised, the food was ready on time.
