Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We went looking for the best deep-dish pizza in Chicago. Found it! The small size pizza was just right for two of us. We got the Lou traditional and it did not disappoint. It takes about 45 minutes to prepare each pizza. Our server suggested we start with a salad while we wait. Not only was the small large enough for both of us, it was a great start to the meal. It was full of fresh ingredients and just the right amount of dressing. Â The sauce on top of the pie was thick but not pasty. The cheese was melted all the way through the pizza. The butter crust was nothing short of tremendous. I am not a crust person, however, on this occasion I eat every bite. No question, some of the best pizza I have ever had. The service was very good and the restaurant was full of sports photos and memorabilia. This is a must- do if you come to Chicago and want some traditional Chicago pizza. They do have other things on the menu just in case you are not a pizza person.
