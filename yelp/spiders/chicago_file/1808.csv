Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////What a great breakfast. We use the Nowait app and walked down from the hotel and the table was ready. Amazing hashbrowns. The original buttermilk pancakes are light and delicious. The coffee latte with almond milk was better than most. My son loved his banana strawberry smoothie. Â Wonderful thick cut bacon. And the hashbrowns are amazing. Highly recommend - there is something for everyone at this restaurant!
