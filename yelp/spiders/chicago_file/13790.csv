Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was crazy about this place!  I  was there last week for a trip and loved the pizza.  By far the best Chicago deep dish pizza we found.  I wanted to eat there again but ran out of time.  We had the special pizza (cant remember the name but it was their specialty-had sausage and lots of cheese!) and a deep dish cookie with ice cream.  This place doesn't have much in lines of atmosphere- basically a hole in the wall kind of feel but the food makes up for it!  If you are in Chicago, you need to check this place out!  Now if I could only say the name without butchering it out every time!
