The Purple Pig////Goosebump-inducing is how I'd describe the meal we had here. My friend and I were just walking around Chicago when I noticed we were walking past this place around 12:30 on a Wednesday afternoon. It was pretty crowded during lunchtime, and I heard of the long waits here, so we made a quick pitstop as this was perfect timing.
