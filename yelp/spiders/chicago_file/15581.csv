Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My boyfriend and I came to Chicago and knew we couldn't leave without eating Chicago's deep dish pizza, so we decided to try this place because it got good reviews. I probably would have given this place a 4-star rating, but there was just one thing that held me back! And that was how much cheese was on the original Malnati Chicago Classic pizza. The cheese on the pizza was so overwhelming. If the pizza had just the normal amount of cheese, it would be amazing! Other than that, this place is great. The wait wasn't too long. We got a seat at the bar and started appetizers there. A short time later, we were called and got seated. You can preorder your food before you sit, so you don't have to wait double the amount of time for your food. Overall, I would most likely come back and try a different pizza, but would recommend it to anyone who comes to Chicago.
