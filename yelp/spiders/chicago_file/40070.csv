Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////4 of us were promptly seated on a Wednesday evening for a 5 o'clock reservation. Notable because: while the time isn't ideal for dinner per se, I do think to get a reservation for a steakhouse of this caliber, and for the neighborhood (River North area) is somewhat significant. What was interesting is we were given 2 choices for a reservation - 5pm or 9:30. But over the course of our dinner, there were still a few empty tables, 4-tops at that, which made us question why our reservation times were so slim?
