Smoque BBQ////Now onto the best part, their food! I ordered a half slab of their St. Louis style ribs. It's got a delicious smoked flavor Â and an excellent dry rub. You pour some of their Memphis style BBQ sauce on those babys and that's all she wrote. I ordered their BBQ beans and mac & cheese for my sides and my hole meal was absolutely fantastic. Smoque will definitely be my go to spot for BBQ.
