Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We had a very nice time here. The Ambiance is probably the nicest I have experienced! Service was a tad spotty. When we arrived, we were asked to relax inside the front door on some nice couches by the bar. We were the only ones waiting for a table. It took about 10 minutes for someone to take a drink order and another 10 minutes for it to arrive. That was unimpressive. Dinner was delightful, though again, on two different occasions, I had to flag down our waitress for assistance. For my wife and myself, the tab, with tip, was just over $400! At that price point, there should be no "flagging". The waitress was very nice and very chatty. She said Sundays are more relaxed, which I understand from her point of view.... Not necessarily from the customers. The dry aged Bone In Rib Eye was decadent and delicious. The sides were also great..... mashed potatoes with gravy and creamed spinach with blue cheese! $75 for the platter of king crab seemed a bit underwhelming, though it was good. They serve it cold! All in all, a very nice experience, but for the price, Gibson's gets the customer service right. We will be back when in Chicago.
