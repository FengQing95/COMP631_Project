Little Goat Diner////2. The Gravy (again). My full order had two honkin' huge and pretty good biscuits on them of which I had no complaints on, but they portioned this gravy out like it was a prison camp. I would say 40% of my dish was gravy-less and for the price and size of the dish, this portion was lamesauce. Totally not enough to enjoy the dish (my friend's was equally lacking as well).
