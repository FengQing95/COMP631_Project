Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We had my SIL bridal shower at cafe on Sat June 30th. What a great place with great people!! The food was delicious and Johnny our waiter was fabulous. He also had a helper that I feel really bad that I don't remember his name, but both of them were very helpful and very nice to our guests. I will definitely be returning. Thank you for making her Bridal shower fun, fabulous and delicious.
