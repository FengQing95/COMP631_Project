Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I live very close to baba reba and we love it! It is great in the summer because you can sit on the patio. It's important to make a reservation because the wait is always long-especially on the weekends. However, if you call ahead the day of and something opens, they are willing to take you. I love the food. You really cannot go wrong, but some specials to note are the spicy potatoes, scallops, salmon, and the meatballs are GREAT!
