Little Goat Diner////I was done eating this after a few bites. The meat was just too smokey and it was pretty much a smokey taste throughout even though I ate it with the eggs and the shredded potatoes. I wasn't a big fan of this plate at all. It's pretty much a plate of meat. Too much meat for the morning and afternoon. I have to say that the potatoes were pretty good if u ate it alone.
