Smoque BBQ////I've been to Smoque on 2 occasions and experienced similar quality both times.  I completely understand they cant go in the back and prepare fresh, authentic BBQ specifically for every order.  The issue I had is the BBQ was dry and lacked quality you would expect for the price they charge.  The St. Louis style ribs were without any moisture but had a decent flavor.  The brisket was a complete bust.  I almost cried as I ate it because of disappointment.  It was super dry, lacked flavor, and the sauce they provided was not good.  I held out hope for the sides to be delicious but they too disappointed.  Mac'n cheese was plain and boring and the baked beans were too soupy.
