Smoque BBQ////Came here on a Saturday evening and didn't have to wait very long in line.  Woohoo!  I got a pulled pork platter, which comes with coleslaw and two sides (BBQ beans and mac and cheese).  The pulled pork was very tender and flavorful, but the temperature was on the cool side, so that was kind of disappointing.  The coleslaw was not my favorite - I didn't really like the dressing - but it provided a refreshing crunch.  The BBQ beans were very good.  Sweet, smoky, bacony, piping hot.  The mac and cheese was good too (and topped with breadcrumbs!), but I think I'll try the fries next time.  My companions said that the brisket chili was fine but nothing to write home about.  Next time, I'll have to try the other meats - ribs, brisket, chicken, and Texas sausage (which I thought was called Elgin sausage in Texas?) - I was playing it safe this time.
