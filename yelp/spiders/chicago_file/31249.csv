Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////With all that said, listen...you're in Chicago so you got to try some deep dish pizza and if you love pizza as much as I do, you'll wait and wait....and then wait some more....until someday and someway you'll finally be seated.  Idk if its the best ever, but its pretty good.
