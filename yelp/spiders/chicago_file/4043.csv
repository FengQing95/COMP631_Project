The Purple Pig////-Grilled octopus - Probably my favorite dish of the meal. The Octopus was soooo soo tender and flavorful. It was perfectly rilled and the flavors all mixed very well with the accompanying ingredients. Anytime they're able to get octopus so tender and flavorful is a win win in my book.
