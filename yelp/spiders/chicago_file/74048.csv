Little Goat Diner////I think my husband and I got lucky on our stop here. I hear that there is usually a wait of at least two hours, but for us on the Saturday of St Pat's weekend was perfect timing. I don't think we waited more than a half hour. The space is modern diner cafe and next door almost like a place you can buy other goods. We used it as a waiting area and we ordered a coffee and looked at the other Little Goat wares on sale like sauces and rubs while waiting for the text that our table was ready.
