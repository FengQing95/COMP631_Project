Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////When in Chicago... pizza is a must!! Lou Malnati's was great!! We could have been seated but chose to sit at the bar. Nick was having a good night... his 3rd night on the job actually. Friendly and cranking out the cocktails! We ordered a small deep dish cheese sausage & mushroom pizza... we were starving too, but it was worth the wait!! Crispy crust that was so scrumptious you wouldn't believe it, with sauce riddled with chunks of tomato and sausage and mushroom! Seriously, it was so good we might have to go back a second time on this visit haha! Blue Moon and Daisy Cutter to accompany this divine pizza pie! Cute decor and nice atmosphere... inside dining and outside dining. Perfecto!!
