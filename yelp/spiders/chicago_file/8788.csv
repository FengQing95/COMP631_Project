Art Institute of Chicago////I have a funny story to relate about the AIC. I had recently gone to Portillo's and got a sandwich for a friend. I then went and tried to check the bag. They wouldn't let me. What is a person to do? I walked up to the entry and carried the bag in and no one said anything. As I was going through some of the exhibits, I notice some staff eyeball me. Then there were a few folks following me. Finally a lady comes up and says, are you carrying an Italian Beef sandwich? Why yes I am! She then proceeds to say, it was making everyone she worked with really hungry and that I shouldnt be carrying it around. Well they didnt let me check it and the guy taking tickets just moved me in. So I go to one of the front counters and they give me two plastic bags to double bag the Portillo's and Im back in the exhibit. I go up to the same lady and show her what I've done and she has a good laugh. Apparently I've wreaked Pavlovian madness in this wing.
