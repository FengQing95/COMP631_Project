Little Goat Diner////We had a great time!   good service and good food.   The menu has many interesting options and food was good!   I do however think this place needs a super duper cleaning!   Take a few days close the door and give the walls and floors a good scrub...give a fresh paint of color and pull down the worn and torn wallpaper!
