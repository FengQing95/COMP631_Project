Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I came to Chicago to try the famous deep dish pizza and I wasn't disappointed. The wait was about an hour for 8 people, but you can order while you are waiting so that cuts down on the overall meal time. It takes them about 30-45 minutes to make the pizza, depending on the size.
