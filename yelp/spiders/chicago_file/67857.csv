Little Goat Diner////Little Goat has some of the best fried pickles I've ever had, for starters. I've also enjoyed the taco salad (no goat chili for me please!) a number of times, and it never disappoints. The tuna melt is also really really great, though very rich, given the unbelievable cheese on top. Everything I have tasted or people I am with have tasted has been truly great.
