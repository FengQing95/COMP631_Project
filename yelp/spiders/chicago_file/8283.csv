Art Institute of Chicago////The impressionist gallery is fantastic, and don't be surprised if you come across a few paintings that you saw in textbooks.  Outside of the Louvre, this could be one of the most impressive collections of art work in the world.  It is not surprising, all you have to do is look at the benefactors who's names are riddled on the walls of the brand new modern wing.  All of the people who have made significant donations are some of the most influential, and wealthy Chicagoans.
