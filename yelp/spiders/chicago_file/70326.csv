Little Goat Diner////we got the blueberry pie which was not warm (may not even be described as warm) which would've been awesome but the thing that threw me off was that the crust was not flake but slightly rubbery texture if aything. the structure looked like it was pre-baked and then stored for use later. it was not crumbling but folding. the goat cheese gelato - ifyou do not like goat cheese you will HATE IT
