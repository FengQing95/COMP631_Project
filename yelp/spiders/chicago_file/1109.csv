Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Hands down, the BEST pancakes I've ever had. EVER. My husband and I came for breakfast on a Tuesday morning around 9:30am - and there was a wait of about 10 minutes. He ordered a breakfast skillet with tons of fresh veggies, and a specialty pancake with berries. I ordered traditional eggs benedict, with cinnamon roll pancakes. All the breakfast items were EXCELLENT - and I would go back in a heartbeat. And, for the two of us to eat a massive meal, it was only about $35. A win for city breakfast in my book!
