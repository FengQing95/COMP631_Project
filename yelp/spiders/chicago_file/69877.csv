Little Goat Diner////Rueben Sandwich: great corned beef which they make in house. But that great meat was buried in a sauerkraut/kimchi mixture which made the bread soggy and the sandwich hard to bite into. And the kimchi tasted like sour cabbage. All of the bite and sinus draining kick of true kimchi was missing. $12. 6/10.
