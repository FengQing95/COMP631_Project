Little Goat Diner////I ordered the bullseye french toast, and to be honest, it was the only item on the table that I was disappointed with. Really good french toast should have a slightly brûléed texture and flavor, but this dish was just soggy. I only ate part of one piece. Kind of a bummer when you have high hopes for your own birthday dinner.
