Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As a visitor from Boston, there is only one place I have to go every time I go to Chicago.  Lou Malnati's is the real deal deep dish.  I get the classic lou, which is everything you want in a true deep dish.  Classic crust, lots of cheese, tasty sausage, and a tomato sauce I wish I could take home with me. (You can actually order these pizzas frozen and get them ups to you)  They also have great gluten free options, my girlfriend got the crustless which is basically a classic lou with a sausage base instead of crust.  Make sure to get there ahead of time as you have to order before you are seated due to the amount of time it takes.  The wait is worth every bite though.  Don't bother with the pretenders.  Lou's is the only deep dish I'll ever eat in Chicago.  Period.
