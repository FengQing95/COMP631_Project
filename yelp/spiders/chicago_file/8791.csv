Art Institute of Chicago////An incredible museum. The only downside is that I almost didn't have enough time to get through all the galleries. Set aside an entire afternoon, grab a map, and do your best to plot out a path through this vast museum. Or if you have less time, the map does give you a "greatest hits" tour of 12 key works of arts housed here. Still, I highly recommend carving out as much time as you can to go through the whole museum, because there is far more than 12 works of art to experience and enjoy here.
