Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I usually wouldnt be caught dead down in 'tourist row' but I had family in town that wanted to get their deep dish on... Anyone that doesnt understand what I mean by 'tourist row', this should help explain. It was the day of the Bears vs. Packers and 90% of people had Packers jerseys on... because no self respecting Chicagoan would be donning green and yellow in 'real' neighborhoods. Anyway, my rating has nothing to do with that... So, we entered the joint and asked to sit outside because it was beautiful out. The tables were set and no one was out there. They said we couldnt because it was closed. I said, it doesnt looked closed.. they said nothing and asked if we still wanted a table. I'm not a dick but seriously? No place in 'real' Chicago would have treated me like a tourist.. but alas, I was in 'tourist row'.. So, we sat in the stuffy crowded and loud back room.. ok, no worries - lets just get our pizza on and move forward. Server was not friendly but I can handle that... I asked for my Italian Beef to be made dry and she asked me what does that meant? I asked if this was her first day and she scowled at me... again, 'tourist row'. For those of you that dont understand - Italian Beefs are severed dipped or dry in Chicago. She then explained mid scowl that the au jus comes on the side - which is great but rare when ordering a Beef. I then asked for chopped onions to be put on the Beef.. She said, 'WE DONT DO THAT HERE' - I put this last part in caps because really.. like really? Its a pizza joint.. you have chopped onions. I have worked at like 5 pizza joints that severed Beefs as well.. YES, you can have f'ing onions on your Beef if you want. I had to explain to her that since they also serve pizza then I bet that they have onions in back that they can put on the Beef... She had the nerve to say, NO - but we can put them on the side... like really? Come on, was that really necessary? Sure, put them on the side, I dont care.. just give me some onions for Christ sake. Needless to say, Beef came out without an onion in sight... weak.
