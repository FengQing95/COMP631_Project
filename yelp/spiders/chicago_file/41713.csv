Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been here quite a few times and always thoroughly enjoyed the passionfruit sangria. But I have to say that the experience diminishes over time (chalk it up to novelty maybe). The bacon wrapped dates are good, but I can do that at home to similar fanfare. The empanadas are in line with empanadas at any other spanish/latin place. I think I can only justify going to take advantage of the afterwork specials, which is what I did for my last visit on 12/23/2011. Otherwise, it's expensive and not that amazing.
