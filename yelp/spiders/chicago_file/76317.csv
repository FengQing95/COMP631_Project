Little Goat Diner////Food. I ordered the duck breast. It was melt in your mouth delicious! Not too heavy or overly fatty either. I cleaned my plate. Dessert. I went with the lemon pie tart. It hit the spot. Not too sweet, a little tart but definitely a great lemon dessert. The crust was amazingly crumbly too! Drink. I got the Eastwoods ride which was the perfect amount of sweet and ginger and alcohol! Haha! Loved it!
