Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here for a bday dinner and we ordered a bunch of stuff: octopus, squid, croquettas, braised beef, lamb, beef tenderloin, potatas bravas and some other stuff I cant remember. All that tried was decent but nothing standout, and everyone else felt the same. On the plus side, I like the ambiance, its fun for a group event, and street parking is usually available.
