Smoque BBQ////Didn't see what the hype was about these. Honestly, of all of the hyped mac & cheeses I've had, they were all marginally better than home-made box mac & cheese. Sure, the textures a little different and you get some crunch, and it's certainly a little better, but not worth throwing a fit over.
