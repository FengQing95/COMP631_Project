Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We both shared a medium Classic Malnati's pizza. With high expectations going in, I was fairly disappointed in the quality. It was good, but not spectacular by any means. The ground beef was menial, and tasted like it could have been baked just a little longer. The cheese was evenly spread throughout the pie, and the sauce was just okay. The crust was pretty good though, buttery crust and crispy on the edges.
