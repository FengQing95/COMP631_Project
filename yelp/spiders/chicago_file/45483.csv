Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////What I did NOT like: while this is a tapas restaurant, I felt the small plates weren't easily shareable. For example, we ordered the garlic scallops and, while delicious, we had to cut each scallop in half to have enough to go around. Also, the chicken empanada (which I did not eat), was literally one medium sized empanada which you also had to cut into sections in order to share. The pixto platter was annoying as well because everything was bite sized! So, if you happened to want that goat cheese croquetta (as I did), but some other member of your party who could not take a hint, also want that croquetta, we basically had to cut it in two. It was wholly aggravating but whatever. I got over and enjoyed my meal anyway.
