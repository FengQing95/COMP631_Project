Little Goat Diner////I love love LOVE Little Goat!  It's almost always busy, but for good reason!  I always get their "Cereal Killers," which are served all day... breakfast/brunch is the best ANY time of the day! Almost every entree is under $15, which is extremely affordable for the quality and amount of food you get, especially compared to it's fancy big sister "Girl & the Goat."  I've had the corned beef hash, the kimchi/bacon/eggs/pancake Asian breakfast, and the Paratha burrito, all which I've enjoyed immensely!  I've had bites of their blueberry pancakes as well as their chocolate pancakes and their sweet breakfast/brunch items are delicious as well.  My friend ordered their Reuben, which quite frankly looked SOOO good, I may be tempted to order that the next time I come here. :D
