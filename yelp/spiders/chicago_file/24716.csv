Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I tried the OG Deep Dish Pizza and a thin crust. The deep dish was definitely better than the thin crust, but it was served lukewarm. The table next to us got a long cheese pull, but ours was a bit set. The pizza is very heavy, so when the menu says "serves 2," it really means it serves 2. The food took a while to come out, but that's pretty standard for deep dish pizza. Overall, I'm glad I got to experience, but it's definitely a treat that I probably won't be craving for a while.
