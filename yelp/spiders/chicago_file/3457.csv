The Purple Pig////Was in town for work and tracked down this place to try it out as others have told me how great it is.  I ordered the chorizo stuffed olives (too much vinegar and chorizo flavors did not have much presence) and chicken thigh kebabs (perfect, would order again).  This place is smaller then most restaurants which creates a very tight-nit feel almost like you are at a family reunion and everyone is crammed into a small space but don't ever really notice it because everyone is having such a great time.  I sat a communal table with some other offend folks and enjoyed my conversations with them.
