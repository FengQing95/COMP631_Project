Smoque BBQ////I've been traveling all over the country and I had BBQ in different places. This BBQ restaurant is by far on my top 3 list. From the second you walk in the amazing smell make you fill like you are in BBQ heaven! I had chopped brisket , texas sausage , brisket chili & the pudding .... I have one word , WOW. Everything is so fresh and yummy , the flavors explode in your mouth and you can stop eat even tho you are already full.
