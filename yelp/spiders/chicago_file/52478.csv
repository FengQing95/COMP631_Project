Smoque BBQ////We met up with other lady friends at Smoque on a sunny Super Bowl Sunday afternoon, our mouths watering by the time we walked in the door.  A number of people were in and out picking up Super Bowl catering orders while we made our selections - in fact, about half of the restaurant was blocked off for Super Bowl pick-ups - and justifiably so, as this is just the kind of grub I'd want at my Super Bowl party, were I to have one.  We all settled on pulled pork sandwiches, available in the full or half size, with varying sides.  I had a vinegary cole slaw and a very large bag of hand-cut fries that we all shared - in addition, the others tried the cornbread and the macaroni and cheese, both baked in little foil ramekins.  Our sandwiches came with a bit of tangy sauce ladled over the top and a small cup of vinegary sauce to add at our discretion.  For me, the half sandwich, shared sides, and a soda were just the right size for lunch - though I regretted not being able to try the brisket (available chopped or sliced) and the various ribs on the menu.
