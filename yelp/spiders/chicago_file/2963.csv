The Purple Pig////Good restaurant and a varied menu. Almost everything on the menu had at least one ingredient that was pickled, brinef or smoked.; usually techniques I don't like. My pickled potato croquettes were light and not to vinegary. I ate... Huevos rotos ( broken eggs). Pickled potato croquettes,Spanish chorizo and black truffle... toasted garganelli with duck bolognese ( not a fan) grilled razor clams with salsa verde.
