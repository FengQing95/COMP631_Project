Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Everything was as it should be, from the warm welcome by the hostesses to the fresh bread with steam still rising from the chewy center, to smooth martinis and a perfectly fine steak. The ambiance of each floor is different, with the upstairs playing jazz and swing, and the downstairs playing more urban music (like nod your head, relaxing in a lounge kind of beats). It's a pricy place, but with every penny. I would change nothing about my experience.
