Little Goat Diner////Food wise, the goat o goat o salad was a standout. Yummy Asian flavours with heaps of crunch and a good amount of shrimp. The goat chilli fries were great but rich. The fried chicken was crisp and moist and served with coldslaw. Only criticism is that accompanying a lot of the dishes was a liberal scattering of fried wonton crisps. Perhaps nix the wontons on the slaw because there's enough fry on the chicken.
