Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Went there on Sunday with my boyfriend and we got seated right away. So many people were in line and the current wait was an hour to two and we thought we had to wait that long but we didn't at all. Within 5min we were seated. The food was very delicious. My boyfriend and I were very pleased with it.
