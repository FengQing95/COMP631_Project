Little Goat Diner////What is it about Little Goat Diner that I love it so much? Is it the relaxed atmosphere that feels quirky, lively, and like a family gathering all at once? Or the expansive menu that covers everything from breakfast (served all day!) to sandwiches to fried chicken to goat and to international foods covering Korean, Mexican, Mediterranean, Chinese? Everything on the menu is a creative interpretation of a classic and they are all done really well.
