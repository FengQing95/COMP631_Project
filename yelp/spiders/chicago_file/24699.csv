Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Omg this food is so delicious! Â We had the salad "chopped extra fine" which made it even better. The deep dish sausage is my favorite but others loved the vegetarian with added sausage. Lol! Maybe a pizza called "everything but the kitchen sink" would be a nice addition to the menu for them!
