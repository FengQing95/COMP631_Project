Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Finally, the sangria. Not a bad price on the half and full pitchers if it was worth drinking. Which it is not. Perhaps I'm spoiled, but to me sangria should still taste like wine. Yes, you should have a bit of sweetness and be able to taste the fruit clearly, but it shouldn't taste like koop aid that someone dumped some red wine in to. I hear their margaritas and cocktails are much better.
