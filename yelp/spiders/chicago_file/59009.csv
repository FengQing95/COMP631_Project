Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////One of the best meals I've had in a while! I love tapas but don't get them very often. My mom and sister had been talking this place up for me, and rightfully so. I got to try the brussel sprout salad, tempura squash, crystal bread, sweet potato coconut soup, and farmers market paella. It was all so amazing but I think my favorite thing overall was the squash, it was a special for the week, it had an amazing curry flavor and was the perfect combo of soft and crispy. The soup was delicious too, super creamy. The paella was amazing too, the 4 of us shared it and still had a ton left over. I would definitely love to come here again!
