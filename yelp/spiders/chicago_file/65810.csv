Smoque BBQ////I ordered a half slab of St Louis Ribs and a side of sliced brisket.   Both were excellent.   Tender, nicely seasoned, very very good.    The brisket was so tender, it just melted in my mouth.    Six pieces of ribs, brisket, fries, mac and cheese and slaw was a lot of food....Maybe next time, I can split with a friend and get only 3 ribs, the brisket and share a side dish.
