Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I'm a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it's wat beneath my feet.
