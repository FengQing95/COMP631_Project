Art Institute of Chicago////This museum was excellent. It had many kinds of art (from around the world, different types of art, different eras of art), so truly, something for everyone. Much of the work was exquisite and a lot of it had explanations about the artist, piece or time period, which was helpful to learn more, rather than just staring at a piece.
