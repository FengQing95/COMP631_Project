Smoque BBQ////As if the anticipation wasn't great enough, Smoque happens to be BYOB, how cool!!!  My friends and I waited in line, case in hand, ready to devour.  We ordered a slab of the baby back ribs, half slab of st. louis style ribs, taster portion of the chopped brisket, corn bread, and chose our sides of baked beans, mac and cheese, and fries.
