Smoque BBQ////We decided to take the 1 hour round trip trek to Smoque based on the fantastic reviews that we've seen on Trip Advisor and many other outlets! We were NOT disappointed! There were three of us, so we got to sample the St Louis ribs, brisket, cole slaw, baked beans, macaroni and cheese, and peach cobbler. Everything was excellent!! The ribs just fell off the bones. The brisket literally melted in your mouth! Everything was brought out while it was still so hot , you had to wait a bit for it to cool down. My only regret is that this place is halfway across the country!
