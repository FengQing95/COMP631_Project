Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is a tapas restaurant in LP. I came here once for Sunday brunch, and continue to come back. Its a place where food is meant to be shared and they accommodate large parties exceptionally well. I celebrated a birthday here last week, and CBBR accommodated our party of 8 and didn't hesitate to split the check 8 ways. My only complaint is that if you order pitchers of sangria, they don't replenish water. My friend and I had to ask for a water refill.
