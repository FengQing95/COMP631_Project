Smoque BBQ////All the meat I've ever had from here is good. Is it the best thing I've ever had in the entire world? No. But that's how I feel people react to this place and I don't get it. Chicken and shredded not sliced brisket is good stuff. Beans and Mac and cheese is good. Corn bread is not even close to the best I've had and I prefer traditional tailgate coleslaw to their more basic approach.
