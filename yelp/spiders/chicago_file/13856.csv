Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm with anyone who says Chicago pizza is the best... and Lou's is a terrific example. I've eaten with Lou twice in the last month, try the Classic! As much as I like the other popular pizza places, I may like Lou's crust just a little better. Its a friendly place and it does a good business so be ready to wait if you get there at peak time.
