Smoque BBQ////Hands down the best BBQ in Chicago. We are fortunate to have this in our neighborhood but regardless it is worth the drive if you are in another part of the city. Excellent and flavorful BBQ and my favorite... the sides. The sides are delicious and I could honestly eat a whole meal of just those! The Mac & cheese, cornbread, and slaw are out of this world. Craving some good quality bbq? This is your place!
