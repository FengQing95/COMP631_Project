Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////2. The ambiance is so lame. When we arrived, we were given a table for two in the main dining room where we were a mere foot away or so from the guests seated at the tables on either side.  We noticed a booth where two people were sitting was emptying out, so we asked if we could sit there. We were told that  that booth was being saved for a larger party (even though all the other booths had just two guests seated in them).  We were offered seats in the basement, which we took, as there was more "elbow room."  However, the basement looked like a bar or a pizza parlor, and the lighting was so poor that my husband had to use the light on his cell phone for us to read the menu.
