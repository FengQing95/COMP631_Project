Art Institute of Chicago////The cafe downstairs was a disappointment. I bought the corn meat sandwich and thought that it would be made to order, but nope!!! The caterer actually took a sandwich from the refrigerator and basically cut it in half and handed it to me. The sandwich was so cold, didn't like at all (2 stars). If it was freshly made, I would probably like it better.
