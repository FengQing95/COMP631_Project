Little Goat Diner////When we arrived at the restaurant, it was close to peak brunch time, and we suffered the consequences! The place was packed and even the foyer was chock full of eager patrons. We were given an approximate wait time of 1 hour. After putting ourselves on the waitlist, we headed to Bombobar across the street and a nearby coffee shop to occupy ourselves in the meantime. (I will say that the automated waiting system that notifies you when your table is ready is fantastic.)
