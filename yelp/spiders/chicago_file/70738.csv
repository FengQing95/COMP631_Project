Little Goat Diner////I've done Little Goat's sophisticated older sister across the street, but sometimes you just want to wear your jeans, not wait in line, and have a messy burger.  I loved Little Goat. We waited only 5 minutes for a table on a Friday night although it was pretty packed. I opted for a patty melt and my friend had the pork belly pan cake.  Note: all the burgers have a beef, goat, or vegetarian option. I went with the goat and was not disappointed. The patty melt was lovely. My friend's pork belly pancake was pretty great too.  There really is nothing like some good pork belly. The menu had so many things that I wanted to try and since Little Goat is totally easy on the wallet, I know for sure that I will be back and will continue to eat my way through the menu. This is my kinda food!
