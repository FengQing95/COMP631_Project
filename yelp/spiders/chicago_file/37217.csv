Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Amazing!  Absolutely loved every minute and every bite! The GARLIC SHRIMP DE JONGHE was one of the best dishes I've ever tasted! We shared the 10 oz Filet Mignon which was repaired perfectly and melted in my mouth!  Our waiter suggested the mashed potatoes and Elote as sides and we were glad we listened!  I would come back just to have more of the potatoes!  We had the Lemon Meringue pie which had 5 inches of the sweetest most wonderful meringue!  We left stuffed and very happy.
