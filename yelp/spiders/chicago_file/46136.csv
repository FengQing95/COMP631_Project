Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Marketing-wise it's brilliant: Gets LEY-FDC members to get in on the first day of the year and start accruing more points, plus the gift certificates encourage you to come back (perhaps with friends, since you already know part of your meal is subsidized).  My only worry was that we'd be in the PJ-minority, and that 'civilians' would be dining with us.  WRONG.  Everybody, and I do mean EVERYBODY (including the employees) were in pajamas.  Hilarious.  It also makes it perfectly acceptable to people-watch, because we're all in on the joke.  I even ran into (PJ-clad) people I knew there -- turns out this is an annual event, and people look forward to it all year!
