Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Comes in second behind long-time favorite Cafe Iberico. The octopus was awesome, short rib was tender but nothing exciting about the flavor. The brussel sprout salad was terrible and the shrimp was good but nothing special, seemed like your standard shrimp scampi type dish. We found the stuffed mushrooms very good and while the jar of eggplant spread to complement the bread was tasty, it was small and not really worth the $$$. Generally smaller portions than iberico. Ordered a pitcher of the black raspberry sangria which wasn't filled all the way full but very tasty.
