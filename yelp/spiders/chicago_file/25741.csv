Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza was good, but filling. I don't know how authentic it was, since we were clearly in a tourist trap. Definitely order the small if you're sharing just between two people. It's way more filling than it looks. We also got the deep dish brownie dessert, which was average.
