Smoque BBQ////I don't like the over use of onions in a few of their dishes but if I liked onions then I would like those dishes too! Keep going back to Smoque...and it's a LONG drive! It's unique. The owners hang around all the time...which usually means that they care...and that the food will maintain it's quality.
