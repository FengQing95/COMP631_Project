Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////First thing's first - be prepared to wait. My wife and I waited close to an hour and a half. The good thing is that you can place your order before being seated. I guess that helps with the wait for your food once you are seated (or it helps them with the customer turnover, you can decide).
