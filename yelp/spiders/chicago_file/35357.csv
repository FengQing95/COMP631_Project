Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////There were three of us so we decided to split several things.  Bone-in, dry-aged ribeye was a good steak, but it was a bone-in, dry-aged ribeye.  It was good but probably my least favorite thing we ate.  It wasn't Bennys (sorry Chicago Mag).  The salmon tartare was absolutely delicious.  It was very flavorful and not dull at all.  The beef tongue was super succulent and we all really enjoyed that.  The horseradish sauce that accompanies is awesome.  The foie gras, it was decent but not the best.  I personally prefer a mousse style as opposed to terrine but even for a terrine this was a bit dense.  The blackberry and raspberry compote that comes with it is stellar though.  The star of the meal though was the fried chicken.  How do  more people not rave about this?  I'm agreeing with Lu H. that it may be the best I've ever had.  I picked up a ball of it and started eating and immediately thought, 'wow, this is so juicy!' but then realized I had no idea what I was eating.  So I asked the server what piece was it and he said part of the breast.  Apparently the free range chickens they use have such  large breasts that they have to split it into pieces.  'Wait,' I thought.  'If this is white meat...'  I of course demanded the thigh.  OMG.  The skin is crispy and flavorful.  But the meat.  It didn't even have the texture of normal chicken meat cause it was so unbelievably moist and tender.  I'm not a sweets person so I typically drink my dessert so I was happy that they had so many great after dinner drinks (Chartreuse, amaros, etc.).  We did all share the vanilla ice cream with chocolate fudge.  The chocolate was great and I enjoyed the ice cream.  Overall the food was really great but the fried chicken the clear table stand out.  I'd give it 4.5 but rounding up due to the excellent server we had.  Can't wait to go back!
