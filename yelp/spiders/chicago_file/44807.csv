Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The ambiance is great for a nice date, girl's-night-out, and just a great meal with good company. Definitely a classy place, but without all of the pretension. The music wasn't too loud, but definitely on the loungy-side. The lighting was dimmed down, but there was enough lighting to enjoy and showcase the food (I really don't care for very dark restaurants..makes me feel like I'm in a dungeon). The service was also good, our waiter was attentive but not overpowering. I'm most definitely coming back, probably with my family and friends. Definitely going back for their sangria! =d
