Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza was alright but would have been much better if it warm. I placed an advance order for delivery 2 hours later at 7p. The driver didn't arrive until 7:15 and had only brought half the order. He said he would be back in 10 minutes with the rest. Thirty minutes later, I called asking for an updated status and was asked if I still wanted the rest of the order--um, yes? I explicitly told the driver I wanted it. They only offered to either refund that part of the order or let me keep waiting. It has now been 45 minutes of waiting, an hour past the scheduled time, my original delivery is cold and I was told the driver was leaving the door 15 minutes ago. Poor customer service for delivery. Be wary, even for simple two item delivery.
