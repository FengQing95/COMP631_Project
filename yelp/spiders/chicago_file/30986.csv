Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I definitely enjoyed the Lou more than the classic because the classic had too much meat. I know what you are thinking, is she serious? I am. This pie is already heavy so the meat makes its 5X more fulfilling IMO. The salad was huge, like it totally can feed 6-7 people. The calamari was ok, it was a little cold and soggy when it got to us.
