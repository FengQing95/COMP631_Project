Little Goat Diner////The bread side offers some redemption.  Most breads and breakfast pastries are fairly good, and I suspect they'll improve over time.  The sweet onion brioche is nice.  Some breads are excessive, however, like the chicken noodle soup bread, and the bacon gouda bread.  Bread need not taste like chicken bullion, and large chunks of bacon are not necessary.  The plain bagel with honey masala cream cheese was delightfully different and enjoyable.  The coffee from Stumptown is good, but the baristas need training in order to consistently turn this excellent coffee into well crafted espresso beverages.
