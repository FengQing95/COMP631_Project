Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The reservation process was a bit strange. It was about an hour wait through the reservation and during that time the app was supposed to let us pre-order our pizza only that it didn't work. Took another hour for us to get our pizza and it did NOT disappoint and was worth the long wait. Due to the popularity, the place was packed. My only wish was that the reservation tracker worked. If it's your first time getting a deep dish pizza, I'd recommend getting the original. Enjoy!
