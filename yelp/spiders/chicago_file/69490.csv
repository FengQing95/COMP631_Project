Little Goat Diner////The apricot masala scone had a great mix of flavors I really enjoyed. I thought the scone was a bit too hard and not crumbly enough, but I'd definitely try the other varieties. Turtle pie was good but really just sweet on top of sweet and not worth $8. Chocolate chip pancakes were downright bad, they came slightly burned and the melted chocolate tasted burnt as well. I was not a fan of the malt and didn't think it added anything - it's rare that I will not finish a dish like this, but plenty was left over.
