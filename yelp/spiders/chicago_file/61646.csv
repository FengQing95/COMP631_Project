Smoque BBQ////I love the quick efficiency of this place, which handles a huge crowd without long waits. The BBQ is good, but not life changing. I agree the brisket is tender, but I've have much more flavorful brisket in the South. The sauces are good, though, so pile it on and you'll enjoy some excellent BBQ.
