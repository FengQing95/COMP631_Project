The Purple Pig////Seating and service was a bit more of a struggle. With the crazy crowds, the seats (at the bar, at least) were cramped and tightly packed. It was impossible to get a menu in a timely manner with our server running around, but luckily everyone at the bar was super polite and we ended all sharing/passing around a copy of the menu. (In fact, by the time my server came to give me a menu, I already looked through and picked all the items I wanted.)
