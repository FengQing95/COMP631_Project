Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////So we get there, were greeted and treated amazingly well. The hosts commented, "oh we see you're celebrating a bday?" I felt special. We were seated downstairs and I loved the vibe. It was dark, like a cavern, and had funky, down tempo music playing. How cool also that seated across from us was a Cubs player.
