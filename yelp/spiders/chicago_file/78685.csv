Little Goat Diner////Jill, we're so happy you stopped by, and we were able to find you a table! It's excellent to hear you received a warm welcome and a prompt overview of the day's specials. Hearing that the okonomiyaki lived up to your high expectations and that your partner enjoyed their omelette thoroughly really brightens our day. From all of us at Little Goat, thank you for sharing your experience, and we hope you'll stop by for brunch again soon!
