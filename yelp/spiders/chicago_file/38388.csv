Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We were in love from the moment we walked in! The ambiance feels like you've stepped back in time with dark mood lighting, jazz music, and almost a mysterious yet romantic feel. The place was packed but we were still able to get a drink at the bar before they sat us in a cozy booth. The cocktails were AMAZING, I mean AMAZINGGGGG. And even though we ordered our first round at the bar, our server knew what they were as soon as they were gone (without having to ask us what they were) and brought another round! Cognac sazerac & lillet rose! Literally perfect his and hers drinks, they were delicious.
