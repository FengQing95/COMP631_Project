Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We had a delicious meal here, the service and ambiance was perfect. We sat in the main dining area and it was darkly lit but a very intimate feel. I think it's fair to say we tried almost all the sides, but the elotes were the surprising standout! We also enjoyed the Mac and cheese and creamed spinach. It was all delicious. Steaks were perfectly cooked as well. And the sourdough bread to start was to die for! 5 stars for sure
