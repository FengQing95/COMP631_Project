The Purple Pig////I've been trying to come to Purple Pig for literally years. In fact, I've tried to dine here on three separate occasions, but the wait was always much too long and inconvenient (1.5-3 hours waiting time--yikes). A friend decided to organize a group of five of us to come here for dinner the Sunday after Saint Patrick's Day parade weekend at 3 PM. There was basically no wait, which we weren't anticipating, so we didn't get there until ~3:45. We were seated immediately after our whole group was present.
