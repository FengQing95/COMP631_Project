Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////No others will ever compare to you. I thought I knew what "Chicago style deep dish" was. I thought BJ's Brewery served me the real thing. I thought all you needed was a deep pie dish, dough and voila, you've got your Chi town pizza. Oh, but others have lied. They're impostors. And you, Lou, have managed to turn a depressing Domino's disgrace into a gourmet masterpiece of cheese, dough, sausage, dough, real tomatoes and some more cheesy dough.
