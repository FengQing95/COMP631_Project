Smoque BBQ////Darn good Q! Came Â here for the first time the other day and man was I pleased. I got the platter of brisket with the mac and cheese and fries. I also got a taste of the pulled pork. Both the pulled pork and the brisket were heavenly. The meat was tender and had a great kick to it. I don't know if its the seasoning or the way they cooked it but man was it good. Next time I visit I will most likely get the pulled pork sandwich. Also they give you lot and lots of bbq sauce which I can dig.
