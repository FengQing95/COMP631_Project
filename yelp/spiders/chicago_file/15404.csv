Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place is a must-go, even if you are just in Chicago for a day! The pizza is delicious and true to the classic Chicago style. Not only that, but all of the food is delicious here. We ordered the signature salad, and we absolutely loved it. Everyone at our table agreed it was one of the best salads they had eaten in a long time. Overall, an excellent restaurant and well worth the (relatively short) wait.
