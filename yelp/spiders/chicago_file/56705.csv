Smoque BBQ////Smoque was solid.  It didn't knock my socks off the way the reviews and line to get in suggest, but it was definitely solid and I'd go again.  You do wait a while in line, but once you get in it's counter service, so you're eating right away.  It's BYOB, so if you drink a few while you're waiting in line, it's just like a normal restaurant, except you have to stand up until the point when your food comes.  Go on a nice day though, cause a chunk of the line is outside.
