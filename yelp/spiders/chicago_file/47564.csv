Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I recently ate here with 3 other friends, and really enjoyed my experience! We made reservations since it was a Saturday night, which I highly recommend since the place was packed. We started out with a full pitcher of their red sangria and a half pitcher of their white peach sangria. Both were delicious. Next the bread came, and even that was delicious. It was the perfect combination of crusty and soft.
