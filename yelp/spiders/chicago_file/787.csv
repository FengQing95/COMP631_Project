Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Not sure why this place is so popular.  The wait is forever any time you go there.  Our waitress wasn't very good at all.  She stood talking to a table forever while we were waiting to order.  There's a point where you're nice to customers and then there's a point where I think they were her friends and she was having a LONG conversation with them.  I had to get up and ask another table for their hot sauce because it took her forever to check on us.  The OJ was water and the food was average - pancakes and all were nothing special.  Wouldn't go back and wait for a table there.  Go to Eggy's Diner around the corner - it's awesome.
