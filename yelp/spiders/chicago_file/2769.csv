The Purple Pig////I got the Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Fried Mashed Potatoes with Tzatziki sauce on the bottom, Â the boyfriend got the Pork Shoulder which I tasted and it was moist, soft and went well with the mash potatoes it's not a big plate so if you're really hungry opt for an appetizer. Both dishes were really good and reasonably priced. For dessert we got the affogato, usually the affogato comes with vanilla bean gelato but we chose the salted caramel instead and with the shot of espresso, the boyfriend and I thought why did we share this but we were stuffed so it was a good thing we did share.
