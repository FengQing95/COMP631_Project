Little Goat Diner////I was shown the bakery side where they still had sandwiches, chili and a bar, it was clear to me at that point that they were just slammed. I cooled off, ordered the beef sandwich and the goat chili. It was all awesome. The staff couldn't be any more professional, the food is what you'd expect from these guys.
