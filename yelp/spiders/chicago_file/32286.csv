Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered the Lou -- Spinach mix (enhanced with garlic, basil & onion), mushrooms a,nd sliced Roma tomatoes covered with three cheeses, on a garlic Buttercrust. When the pizza came out, it was very watery. I'm guessing it's from the tomatoes. Be sure to pack your patience -- the pizza can take at least 30 minutes to prepare!
