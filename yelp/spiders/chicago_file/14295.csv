Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Upon entering the restaurant, there were two hostesses on duty.  It was a cold night and the restaurant was not yet busy.  We opted to sit at the bar so we could watch T.V. while we enjoyed our meal.  The hostesses were friendly, but did not seem overly sure of what to do. While at the bar, we were greeted quickly by the bartender, Greg, who offered us drinks and menus.  Carol had a glass of Chardonnay and I opted for an unsweetened Iced Tea.  Both the wine and the tea were good, but the Iced Tea did not taste fresh brewed.
