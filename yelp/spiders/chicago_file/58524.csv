Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I just love Cafe Ba Ba Reeba. It reminds me of my time in Spain and I always feel such a welcoming vibe from this place. Wait staff is always happy to serve and I can tell they are treated well. I love the variety of dishes and the sangria flight is a must to try the new seasonal flavors each time I go.
