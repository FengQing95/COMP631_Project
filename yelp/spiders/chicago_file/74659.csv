Little Goat Diner////My Friend ordered the ruban sandwhich. She's 99 percent vegetarian, and she happened to order the meatyest sandwhich on the menu. Now she loves killing animals! Thanks Izard! Haha. Joke. ONCE AGAIN NO SHAME. The combination of meats and kimchi was outstanding. She also ordered the mac and cheese, it was baked in a three cheese sauce. I had a bite. It was a great decision.
