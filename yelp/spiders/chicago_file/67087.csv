Little Goat Diner////My daughter had been here and raved about the place.  It was meh!   I had the BLTA and it was kind of greasy.  The bread was toasted like a grilled cheese but it was just too much.  I've made a lot of grilled sandwiches in my day but mine aren't 12 napkin worthy.  My son had the Los Drowned and that was not praise worthy either.  My son said the beef tasted like wedding beef, or the dinner party after the funeral beef.  I won't even explain how he came up with that analogy.  We ordered fries because they don't come with the sandwiches.  For 15.00 a sandwich the fries should come with it!  My daughter had the shrimp and grits which were good.  I have to say I was not impressed with my visit.  Very noisy and loud too.  The highlight of my visit was meeting another Top Chef, Fabio Vivianni, who was outside at his restaurant across the street.  We had to wait 45 minutes for a table so we waited outside and there he was.  So damn cute he is!
