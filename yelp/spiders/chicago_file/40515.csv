Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Absolutely phenomenal. From the wait staff to the food, Bavette's is one of a kind! We came late on a Tuesday night and were fortunate enough to get a table outside right away. Â we ordered the beef tartare as an appetizer along with the crabcakes and the bread. All of them were incredible five orfive. The sourdough bread was definitely one of the best I've had. For dinner I ordered the steak frite ribeye. I have been to many steak houses in Chicago and this was by far the best ribeye I have had. I still dream about the flavor and the melt in your mouth the texture of the ribeye. Fries were also phenomenal. The waiter informed us that the ambience inside is so unique that it is deserving of a second trip back with the reservation for inside. I can't wait to check it out and will definitely be back whether it is it inside or outside!
