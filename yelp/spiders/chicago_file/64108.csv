Smoque BBQ////Had a full rack of ribs, Mac and cheese, pulled pork sandwich and the peach cobbler. The BBQ sauce is what makes this place. The ribs were do tender we cut them with plastic forks! We dinned in so all the aromas added to the overall experience. Besides what better way to celebrate the 4th than with ribs!!
