Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Came back a year later. Food is still amazing, we came to celebrate my boyfriends the birthday. Jameson and Pickleback shots are our new favorite. We had the lobster, clams, the Chicago cut (amazing), the beef stroganoff and wild mushrooms. While most of the staff was great we did have one rude server. Â Thankfully this server was only there temporarily until a much better waiter named Julio was done with another table. Julio was kind, attentive and just overall a good guy that saved our birthday celebration.
