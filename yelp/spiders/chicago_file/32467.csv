Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////An out of town friend was visiting Chicago for the first time, so had to have deep dish pizza. Lou Malnati's does not take reservations,  but when we arrived on a Friday evening,  we were seated immediately.  The restraunt is decorated with many sports items, not Chicago related, but added a bit of character.  The restraunt has two levels and looks much bigger than you except when entering.  Our waiter Tony/Anthony was accommodating and provided detailed explanations of options. He thought we all were from out of town, so the explanations and helpful suggestions would have been useful if we had not eaten Lou's before. We started with the combo appetizer a variety of fried items.  It included zucchini,  mushrooms,  cheese curds, and mozzarella sticks. It included ranch and marina for dipping.  The variety was good .  The malnati salad is always my go to.  We always get the individual size, not family and it is more than enough for 4 to share. The sweet vinaigrette dressings is one of my all time favorites. For the pizza , we haf the Malnoti's Chicago Classic.  Tony/Anthony ( he introduced himself by both names) offered the option of the sausage as a patty or in pieces.  This was the first time we were offered an option even after numerous visits. The buttercrust is so good.  I often pick up the dough to make pizza at home, of course,  it never comes close to Lou's.   Overall, we were not disappointed and the food  remained consistent Lou's.
