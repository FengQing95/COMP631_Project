Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were starving so we ordered an app sampler while we were waiting for the pizza. The appetizers are huge, so if you are hungry you might want to pace yourself. The dip platter was good, but could have fed 6 people. The calamari was good as well, but Â also a giant portion. We ordered way too much. The pizza was really good. Super heavy on the cheese and with extra sauce. The only thing that I didn't care for was the way that they do their sausage. It is more like a patty that covers the entire pizza and is then covered in sauce. All in all, we had our deep dish experience. They have a bar as well there which was mildly busy. I was satisfied with the experience and can say that I have had Chicago pizza now. Host staff and wait staff were pleasant.
