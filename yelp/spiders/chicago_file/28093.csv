Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Honestly this place never disappoints. If you read my last review from last night in my stay in Chicago you'll know I was at Gino's. & it was the worst meal all of my trip. However tonight I decided to come to Lou malnatis and OF COURSE it was amazing !!! Ordered to go after a night out and it was HOT, great service & delicious !!! Totally wish we had this is California
