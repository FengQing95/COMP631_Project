Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou's serves great pizza.  It has a wonderful flavored sauce and the cheese is fresh and melted perfectly.  If you like Deep Dish you must try this place.  The only down side is because it is made fresh to order and is deep dish, it takes about 35-40 minutes to get your pizza.  The staff informed us of the wait before we ordered which was really nice in case we were in a hurry.  The side salad was not great.  It was dressed in dressing (1000 island), but was way too dressed, made the lettuce wilt and had too much Mayo added.  Stick with the pizza and you will love this place!
