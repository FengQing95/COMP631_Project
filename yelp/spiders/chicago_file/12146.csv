Art Institute of Chicago////We have been members here on and off for years.  It really pays if there is just one of the special exhibits you want to see.  There have been many for us over the years.  Most recently we went to see the Warhol exhibit.  If you have a chance it is really terrific.  Even if you are not a fan it is worthwhile.  I learned so much from the exhibit.  But here lies my little beef.  Now, you can listen to the audio guide through the app (no extra charge).  Unfortunately I don't think they have the kinks worked out of it yet. Four of us went and we all tried to use it.  Three gave up. I persevered and finally got the hang of it about half way through.  Even then it wasn't perfect.  It was difficult to navigate through the audio in order and also listen to the special numbered exhibits which required you get out of order on the audio map.  Software needs some work.
