Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our table ordered a dozen raw oysters with a mixture of east and west coast, the crab cakes, the 16 oz dry aged New York strip, the Brussels sprouts, the Mac and cheese, the elote corn, and the mashed potatoes. My favorites were the Brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes and New York strip. The Brussels were so flavorful. The mashed potatoes came with whole pieces of roasted garlic in it. I loveeeee garlic, so I was really happy about that. The steak was so tender and came out perfectly.
