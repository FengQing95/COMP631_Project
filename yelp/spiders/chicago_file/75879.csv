Little Goat Diner////As you'll come to find, one of the types of cuisines that excites me the most is Asian fusion!  Fusions inspire culinary creativity, and that makes my blood rush! Little Goat did it again with this twist on breakfast. "This Little Piggy Went to China" (sesame cheddar biscuit. sunny eggs. Szechuan pork sausage. chili garlic chive sauce. blackberries.) Different ingredients married together to create this fun play on the traditional eggs, sausage, and biscuit dish.  Blackberries? (Shrugs) It worked.  Nothing boring here.
