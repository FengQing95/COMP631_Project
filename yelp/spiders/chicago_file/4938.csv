The Purple Pig////They don't take reservations, but there is a decently sized covered tarp with heating (!) and tall tables where you can order appetizers and drinks. You can also go for a walk and check out downtown (including the impressive candy store), because they have a nice texting system that gives you 10 minutes to return and claim your table.
