Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////As for the paella, you have to order 2 servings minimum. I recommend the seafood paella (shrimp, squid, mussels). It's amazing and goes great with the red sangria. This place is great for date night, birthdays, celebrations, just about anything really. I especially love the outer room seating area- the walls are exposed brick and the lights are dim with string lights hanging on the ceiling - it's a cozy atmosphere. Our service has always been great as well considering how busy this place always is. Reservations should be made well in advance. Tip: check in on the yelp app to get a free dessert tapa!
