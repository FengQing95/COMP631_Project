Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////service is a bit slow but nice disposition. The pizza did take 40 min to come out but I guess it's how it goes with deep dish. The pizza itself was very tasty, sauce and cheese ration were nice! Crust wasn't my favorite but wasn't bad. In all would come back but they need to work on service a bit.
