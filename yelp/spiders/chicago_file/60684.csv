Smoque BBQ////Our Smoque dinner was 7 hours ago. I've washed my hands plenty of times. My fingers still smell like smoky BBQ. My boyfriend's fingers still smell like smoky BBQ. Yours probably will too. Weird? A little, but it's just a testament to how rich and powerful those smokin' St Louis ribs were. I don't even care how uncouth I may have looked sucking on those bones with all I had in me. I went from sweet Asian girl to frenzied Asian barbarian, fingers coated with that deleeeeeectable spice rub. I apologise, these babies deserved all the love I could give them.
