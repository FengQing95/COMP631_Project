Art Institute of Chicago////Honestly I can give them just one little star because I am not really impressed any more. Sometimes I like to visit museums even though I am not an art person. Â I have been at the Art institute almost 5 times in 4 years and I don't think they have changed many things over that time. It is almost the same every time. I think they need to change things a little more often and another thing that bugs me is it's still hard to go to the restroom. All the restrooms are far away from the gallery. If you want to go there you have to walk a lot to find it. It is inconvenient and the modern wing also looks kind of boring nothing special.
