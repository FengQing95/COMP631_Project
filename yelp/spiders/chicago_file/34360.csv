Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We got a bunch of different things and shared.  Tried the apple and endive salad which was the "healthy" piece of our meal and salmon tartare to start which were both lovely.  I know it's just bread, but the sourdough was delicious.   Loved the Beef Stroganoff - so rich with house made noodles, creamy sauce, and perfectly tender beef.  The fried chicken was crispy and the ranch dressing that came with it was spot on.  There was also a giant baked potato with all the right toppings, a pork chop that my friend said was "the best" and, of course a steak.  We all left stuffed and happy!
