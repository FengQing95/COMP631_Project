Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////As for the deep dish pizza, the Lou was a combination of spinach mix, mushrooms, and sliced roma tomatoes covered with blend of mozzarella, romano, and cheddar cheese on garlic buttercrust. I think the veggie toppings were not exactly my favorite choice, especially with sliced tomatoes on top so I was already a bit put off. As a cheese lover, I found that the cheese was too excessive and stringy as well. I only had one slice and had to call it quits.
