Smoque BBQ////No off-street parking, and on-street parking close to the door is prohibited by signs that say "No Smoque Parking".  The side street had little un-signed parking as well. we however, drove around the block, through the alley, went South on Pulaski and parked in the spot closest to the door.  I suspect we were pretty lucky.
