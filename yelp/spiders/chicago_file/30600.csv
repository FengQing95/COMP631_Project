Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Not bad.  I got the personal sized pizza.  It wasn't too big.  Fairly tasty.  It took 40 minutes, which might be understandable for a huge deep dish, but I felt like this was a bit on the small side to take so long.  If you're into deep dish, everyone raves this is the best pizza in Chicago.
