Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////We got two sides of pancakes (signature berry and cinnamon roll) and wish we had gotten more! The cinnamon roll pancakes were especially delicious. But both were outstanding. Definitely worth the wait! The Denver scramble was good, but next time we'll save the stomach space for more pancakes!
