Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We've been here a handful of times for date night. I love their tapas! The chorizo wrapped dates are seriously to die for as was the short rib. The sangria has been hit or miss but I'm there for the food :) The service has always been good and our experience pleasant. I would definitely recommend this place!
