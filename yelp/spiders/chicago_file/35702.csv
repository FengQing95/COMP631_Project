Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Drinks: Bavette's has the best Old Fashioneds in the city of Chicago, period!  I get the Old Overhold (balance of sweet and spicy) and my husband gets the Landy vs Cognac (sweeter). You can bring your own bottle of wine (I believe it's one bottle for every 2 people?), but you have to share one glass with one person in the restaurant of your choosing or they will choose for you (which I love).  We bring a bottle of wine when we have a reservation, but not when we are dining at the bar (not sure if you can do this at the bar).
