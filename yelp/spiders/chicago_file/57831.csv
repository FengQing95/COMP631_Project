Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have to say this place really deserves the rating they have on Yelp. During this whole situation with COVID they do have the systems in place to help people feel safe. Food was awesome! Our server Max was the best! He took the time to make us feel welcome and suggested some really good choices, since it was our first time. The Paella was really good! I recommend to try the grilled Octopus! I will be coming back. Thank you.
