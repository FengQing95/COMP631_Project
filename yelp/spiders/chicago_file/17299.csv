Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I was in Chicago for the weekend, and my girlfriend and I decided that we since we both loved pizza is would be a crime to not get some Chicago style pizza while we were in town.  The restaurant itself is very nice.  The décor is fairly modern, though sparsely decorated.  We were seated quickly though we did have to wait several minutes for our waiter to get to us.  He did a drive by, and said he would be with us soon during our wait though.  They were busy at the time, so it wasn't a big deal.
