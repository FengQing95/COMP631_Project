Smoque BBQ////Since then I've only order for to-go to bypass the long wait and the food is just as good! Their sandwiches are a hefty portion and I typically have enough for a 2nd meal. The sides are also quite tasty such as the mac & cheese and the baked beans. They have bits of meat in beans which makes it heavenly. You also can't miss the peach cobbler!
