Smoque BBQ////I have to give them props for the mac and cheese. It is awesome! Too bad they give you so little of it. I'll have to order an extra next time. And the cole slaw was fresh, tasty, and zesty. I prefer a creamy slaw, but their slaw was very good. The fries instantly reminded me of Jimmy's fries, except, they were not as good as Jimmy's.
