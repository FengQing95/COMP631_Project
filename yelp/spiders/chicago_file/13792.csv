Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We have been here before and really loved the pizza and service.  This time everything was just a bit off.  The wait wasn't bad for our table, we pre-ordered our pizza as they recommend, we enjoyed a bottle of wine but when we were finally sat it seemed to take forever for our pizza to come out.  The biggest disappointment was that it wasn't that warm bubbly pizza we remembered, the cheese was chewy/cold.  Not sure I will come back, too sad from our first fantastic experience.
