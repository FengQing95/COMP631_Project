Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Oh em gee! I read all the reviews and it still exceeded my expectations. The wait was 30 minutes, but so worth it. I had the Mexicana skillet (delicious), my boyfriend had the Fresca and we both ditched the toast for pancakes! (You get 2 pancakes each). In retrospect we should have gotten one meal and shared. The portions are pretty big. I also had a cafe latte...pretty good too. The service was exceptional as well. If you're visiting the Chi, this plus is a must. When we are back in Chicago we will always visit!
