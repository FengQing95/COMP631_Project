Little Goat Diner////My husband and I went here for a Valentine's Day brunch during a "staycation" in Chicago.  The food was FANTASTIC!  The menu is so interesting.  Everything came out really quickly and the server was extremely helpful.  I definitely recommend a reservation - the place was PACKED at 10 on Sunday.  We had to wait a little bit despite having a reservation.
