Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you look at it as a giant pizza pop tart with a ton of cheese and tomatoes. it's wonderful. I can't call it pizza, I just can't. But I tell you, it is tasty, but in small doses. There's enough cheese in these things to gag a Cheesehead...excellent! The tomato sauce is very nice if a little sweet. The crust is buttery (weird) and a little too much for me.
