Smoque BBQ////Cool spot, good to very good food. Great patio and location. Meats that we've tried have been very good. Friendly service but the ordering process is a little odd - ordering at front, getting a number to sit and then grabbing a table and all your drinks and utensils yourself while you wait for your food to arrive. The side dish options aren't mind blowing but the meats I've tried have been very good and high quality. Great beer selection.
