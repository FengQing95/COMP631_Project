Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My boyfriend and I got seated very quickly although I would recommend making a reservation if possible since it's a very popular place. We ordered a bunch of tapas and our favorite was Grilled Ib√©rico Pork with Red Chimichurri. That is definitely a MUST TRY if you're a chicken person. The chicken was very juicy and the sauce complimented it very nicely. I would also recommend try their sangria as that is always a very delicious option.
