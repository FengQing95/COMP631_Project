Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After a 30 min wait, both pies come out and immediately my husband noticed the crustless pizza had been packed in a deep dish pan bc of the shape. We asked the waitress if they use the same pans for regular pizza as they do the gluten free? Yes, but let me get the manager who is gluten free herself. Manager comes out and says she's only gluten intolerant, not celiac, but basically said that they take ZERO precaution with gluten free pizzas. They use the same prep bins for all pizza, which would make the cross contamination VERY HIGH. Â Reaching in to the bins with the same hands and touching the toppings to the dough. Nope. I had to sit and watch my husband eat his dinner at 6 pm or so, while I waited to go somewhere else after bc the manager told me it wasn't going to be safe for a celiac. I told her they should use separate pans for gluten free pizzas if they're gonna advertise to celiacs. Also, put separate bins for toppings. Otherwise, have your staff trained to know and put a disclosure on your menu. I'm so disappointed.
