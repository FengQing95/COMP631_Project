Smoque BBQ////As for the specifics, I'd have to say that anything I found not to my taste was probably pretty much a matter of personal preference.  For example, I don't like fatty beef and the brisket was kind of fatty.  Good flavor, but fatty.  OTOH, the pork was lean and delicious.  The ribs were very good, though neither were the fall-off-the-bone sort which I prefer.  The dry rubs were excellent, but the sauce had a lot of cumin in it and I just barely tolerate cumin.
