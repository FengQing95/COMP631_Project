Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Place was a madhouse when we arrived (Saturday night around 7:30pm) and were quoted an 1 hr and 30 minute wait for a party of four. Inquired about take-out and there was a 50 minute wait for that and we just decided to wait for the table. Wait estimate was spot on almost to the minute so good job on that but I guess we were secretly hoping it would take less time. You can pre-order your pizzas while waiting but since this only saves a few minutes I'm not sure what the point is. Service was a bit slow once we were seated as we didn't see a waitress for almost 10 minutes and from that point every time we needed something we had to flag her down.
