Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food and sangria are both delicious. It is nice because you can try lots of different foods for a reasonable price. They have a large menu that caters to people of all tastes. The server even brought out a sample of the sangria to make sure we liked it before deciding on a pitcher.
