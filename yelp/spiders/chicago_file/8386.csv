Art Institute of Chicago////We visited the Art Institute specifically for the Picasso in Chicago exhibit, but were equally impressed with the variety and quality of additional exhibits. Don't let the lines out the door sway your opinion of visiting; the line moves quickly and the crowds are quickly dispersed once you have paid and are inside the museum.
