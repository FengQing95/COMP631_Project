Art Institute of Chicago////I love museums and this is such a beautiful museum you want to visit.  The famous painting here?  American Gothic.  You know the older couple in front of the house and the man holding a pitchfork?  This is home to the famous painting.  You'll want to spend 2-3 hours here to fully enjoy it, but if for whatever reason you're limited on time they have an hour guide for you to follow and hit all the big art.
