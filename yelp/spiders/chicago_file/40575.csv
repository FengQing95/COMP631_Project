Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavette's is a classic Chicago steakhouse! If your looking for high quality steak in an upscale yet tavern feeling restaurant, look no further. I went to Bavette's for my birthday on Â a Thursday and could only find a table for 9:30pm! We booked it three weeks in advance, so plan ahead! If you're a small party, they might be able to accommodate you as walk-in or offer seating by the bar.
