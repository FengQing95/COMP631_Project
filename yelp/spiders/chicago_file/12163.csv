Art Institute of Chicago////They have an awesome collection that has permanent residency in the museum, but they also change up exhibits so there is always some new exhibits.  The last time I was their there was an exhibit on Chinese art.  This time the same hall had an exhibit from The Japanese Ukiyo or Floating Pillow World was there in place of the Chinese Art.  We also walked through an exhibit that had a ton artifacts Arts of Southeast Asia that was interesting.  I wish we had a little more time, but tomorrow's another day
