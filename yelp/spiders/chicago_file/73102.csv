Little Goat Diner////We showed up and were seated immediately. I got the Korean Burger and Alex got the Sloppy Goat. We also hit up the mac and cheese. Everything on the menu is a la carte, which means you get only what you order and no "extras" (like the fries that folks like myself think come with the burger). My burger was fantastic--I would have liked the spicy mayo to be spicier though--there was very little, if any, kick to it. The Sloppy Goat was really great as well; wouldn't really change anything here.
