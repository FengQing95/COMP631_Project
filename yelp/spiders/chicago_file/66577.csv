Little Goat Diner////Went for dinner on a Thursday night and the place was packed, but we only had a twenty minute wait before being seated and the service was quick after that and the food was tasty. Everything on the menu is a la carte, so be prepared to pay extra for any sides with your main dish. Desserts are mini pies baked next door, but they were all out of all but one by the time we ordered so put in a request early!
