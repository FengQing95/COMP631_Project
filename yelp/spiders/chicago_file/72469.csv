Little Goat Diner////I also liked that they allowed us to split our checks however we wanted, instead of some strict rules that are unnecessary. This place is just across the street from the girl and the goat, and it is connected to a bar and a coffee house that is also affiliated with the girl and the goat. You can buy some souvenir or cookbook while you wait for a table. Oh the cutest part is, well of course everything has a goat on here if you order a drink or something, but I think the cutest part is there are individual coat hooks by each booth :)
