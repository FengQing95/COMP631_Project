Smoque BBQ////I mean, man, it's OK. Choqago has extremely low expectations for barbed bequeue in the first place, which doth make sense for a collection of expatriate rubes from their respective small cornfed (not grass-fed) mid'ouestern burgs. They come, hand-in-hand, guileless former Model U.N. team captains, rubes all, full-sleeve tattoos of internet memes ("me, me!"), queuing up and begging for the queue, barbed bequeue, rube-ix-que'be. From Iowa or the "upper penisuala" they arrive, ignorant and demanding. Even down to the name, it is expected that "ashtray mouth" is the penultimate goal of dining here, but nothing will cure such a flavor, least of all notwithstanding the inappropriately vinegarish "Coles Law." Sound the Amber Alert, they done made off with Ashley's innocence!
