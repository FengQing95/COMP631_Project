Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The bad/ugly: Called in the morning for a reservation, none available. Was told to call again 5:30 PM to get on the list, and was then told it would be a 90 minute wait. Arrived at 6:30 and got some sangria in the bar while we finished our wait. At 7:15, my friend asked the hostess when our name would come up. She said 10-15 more minutes. At 7:45 (over 2 hours of waiting later), my friend asked again and they said their system wasn't working properly but they had tried to text us. We had to text. They told us it would be another 10-15 minutes as we watched people who arrived after us get seated. At 8 PM, we were finally seated at 2.5 hours of waiting and no apologies. We couldn't possibly enjoy our experience after that.
