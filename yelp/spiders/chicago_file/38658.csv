Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our waiter was just as great as the bartender downstairs and gave us very helpful recommendations and answered my many questions about the menu. We ended up starting with the Garlic Shrimp de Jonghe and a basket of their fabulous sourdough bread and butter. The shrimp were perfectly cooked and I could've gone swimming in the garlic sauce. It was also a very hearty portion. I can't believe I'm about to review the bread and butter but they were SO good and and one of the fabulous little touches that makes Bavette's a five star establishment in my book.
