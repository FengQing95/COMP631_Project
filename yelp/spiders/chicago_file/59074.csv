Smoque BBQ////So me and the BF made the trek from Oak Park to pick up Smoque. Real pain to get there, but worth it, right? Well, yes and no. BF got the chopped brisket. A+. I got the full rack of ribs and gotta say, disappointed. First, they seemed overcooked. Second, they were not especially meaty. Really? Come on, Smoque! And they are pretty much the priciest thing on the menu, so I expected more. Will be back, someday (it's a long drive) but I think I'll stick to Q in La Grange. Way closer and honestly? Just as good.
