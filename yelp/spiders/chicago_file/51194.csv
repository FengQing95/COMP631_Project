Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Huge huge huge tapas fan and was not disappointed by Cafe Babareeba. Went here for a work dinner with bunch 10 other people. The staples like the wrapped dates and the meatballs were on point, but the hangar steak and the goat cheese tomato garlic bread REALLY stole the show. Ordered the paella as well, but I was not a fan.
