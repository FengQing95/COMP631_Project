Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////One of the best places to get Chicago Deep Dish Pizza. Gets crowded every night of the week. Very small bar area, so even though I was by myself, I needed to wait for a table. They have a lot of seating upstairs. Nice place, good friendly service and the best pizza around. If you don't preorder your pizza you will have a 40 min wait after ordering. Decent beer and drink selection as well.
