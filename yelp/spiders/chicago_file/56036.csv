Smoque BBQ////We also did the Add a taste for like $3 where you can get the brisket or pulled pork.  The brisket you get a choice to have it sliced or chopped and we got chopped.  I think I would have preferred sliced but it was good.  I liked the pulled pork better than the brisket.  It seems that with BBQ it is hit and miss on the pulled pork and brisket. We did both.  Sides we got: Fries (Excellent)/Mac n Cheese (Excellent but kids did not like) and the Corn Bread (excellent).  I heard a couple of people by us saying something about the peach cobbler so I which I would have tried that but I guess it gives me a reason to go back.
