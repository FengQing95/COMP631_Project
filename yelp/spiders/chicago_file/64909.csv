Smoque BBQ////Great barbecue with a wide range of sauces for its well smoked ribs, St Louis ribs and brisket. Sides were great too especially the Mac and cheese. Great flavor with a nice crunch. Parking can be tight and makes this restaurant better for take out. Someday when smoked barbecue is less popular in a hundred years it might be easier to park. Don't let that deter you if you want to eat in. It is like any neighborhood parking in Chicago.
