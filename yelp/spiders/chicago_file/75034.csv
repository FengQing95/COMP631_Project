Little Goat Diner////We were seated immediately and despite my request, rooftop was closed :(. Feeling extra fatty, I tried the tiramisu shake and he had coffee. Shake was $7 and I felt I was drinking a $2.99 chocolate shake from Denny's. It had little pieces of chocolate cereal or dried up bread, couldn't tell the difference. His coffee was so strong, he used half the damn raw sugar to sweeten it up. Service was quick and efficient despite it being crazy packed for 11:30a on a Monday. Maybe all the hungover Lolla-goers pulled the same move as us?
