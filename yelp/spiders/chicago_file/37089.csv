Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Food is pricey but it was a birthday meal so for us worth it.  We started with sourdough bread, went with 1/2 crab and avocado salad and 1/2 wedge salad, we both got filets with bone marrow as an extra (truly sensational - the bone marrow was incredible with the filet) and capped off with Carmel ice cream (seriously the best - actually pushed my favorite salted brown butter almond Jeni's to 2nd place) with homemade hot fudge.  Everything was fantastic.  This post may be full of lots of pretty adjectives but truly not hyperbole - the best.  I had a French 75 and my husband kept with red wine and then scotch.  If we're lucky enough to be around town for dinner again we'll definitely try and come back.  There's also a speakeasy in the basement with full kitchen service so if packed you might luck into bar spot down there too.  Excellent!  Thanks for making 40 easier to take;)
