Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I ordered the Mexicana skillet with a side of blueberry pancakes - mmm mmm good!  Fresh cilantro, jalapenos and chorizo - need I say more?  As others mentioned, portions were large, but I couldn't stop myself!  I ate just about everything, including the pancakes.  (Food coma ensued, and I definitely didn't feel hungry for dinner).
