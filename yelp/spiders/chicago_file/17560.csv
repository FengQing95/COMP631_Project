Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Once seated, in a cute two person booth, we were promptly offered to order drinks by both of the waitstaff on our floor. Drinks were fast enough and then we entered the order for an appetizer (buffalo wings). We had the appetizer in about 15 minutes and just as we finished the pizza was coming out.
