Smoque BBQ////Flat out the best BBQ in Chicago, and possibly the best I've ever had.  We nearly ordered 1 of everything and just took the leftovers back to our place to gnaw on for the rest of the day.  Barbaric but amazing.  Their St. Louis ribs were the standout.  Amazing Amazing Amazing.  We love Smoque BBQ!
