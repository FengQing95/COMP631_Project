Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I'm completely biased to this place as I've had so many great date nights with my fiance, group dinners with friends and even some great nights out with colleagues.  Frankly I could just order bacon wrapped dates, spicy potatoes and sangria and I would be in heaven.  Always try and order one different plate.  Sometimes its great and other times its not for me.  If you go with a group is not as expensive as some people think but two people with drinks can add up (well worth it though).
