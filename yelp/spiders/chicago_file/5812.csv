The Purple Pig////This place was absolutely amazing!!! Delicious in so many ways. The only thing that threw the experience off was our waiter Troy.. we asked to have him bring the boxes with our food and he rudely replied "well this isn't a fast food joint) and stomped away like it was the end of the world.
