Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is a great tapas place with a variety of decor depending on whether you sit at the busy and bustling bar or get a nice table with dim lighting and romantic decor for a nice night out. I had the latter and it was a great time to just chat with my girl. The waitress was really friendly and recommended the rack of lamb special of the day, which we eagerly enjoyed couples with the brussel sprout salad (which is really shredded brussel sprouts in a Caesar Salad-esque style with nuts),short rib, and the paella mixta which was dank. Would recommend for a nice date out with options for the type of mood with the different spots (busy bar or quiet table).
