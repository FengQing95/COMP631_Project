Smoque BBQ////I had the chopped brisket sandwich with fries and was lucky enough to try some of my husband's St. Louis ribs and Texas sausage. All were EXCELLENT. We weren't planning on getting the sausage, but I had a couple to use (where you need to spend $25) so we added a Taste portion of that on and it was a nice surprise!
