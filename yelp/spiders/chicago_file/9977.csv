Art Institute of Chicago////If you're thinking about going here.. go! I went with my friend and the art is stunning. You could spend a full day here so the price of admission is definitely worth it. Darlene King rung us up for tickets and she was so pleasant and friendly.. probably one of the best customer service experiences I've ever had.
