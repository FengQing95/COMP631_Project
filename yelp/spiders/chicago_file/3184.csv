The Purple Pig////It was so tough trying to decide what to order. Purple Pig has reimagined so many classic dishes, from Lobster Cannoli to the dish I had for dinner- Beer Tenderloin with a delicious meat pie and BROCCOLI ICE CREAM. Yup! A first and I would be sad if it was my last. The ice cream balanced all of the flavors so well and really brought the dish together.
