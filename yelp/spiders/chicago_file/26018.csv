Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////If you're in Chicago, deep dish pizza is a must. & Lou's pizza is the absolute best. A friend & I were looking for Gazzola's pizza in the area yesterday, HIMYM fans will know about this place. What we didn't know is that it doesn't exist. We found the closest pizza place from our location & couldn't have been happier with what we found.
