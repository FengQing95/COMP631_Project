Little Goat Diner////Great little place. The table split an app of fried pickles and onion rings, really enjoyed the mustard sauce with that. For a main course, I had the sloppy goat (and the table split an order of the smoked fries), which was amazing and I was stuffed silly by the end. Would happily come back any time I was in town.
