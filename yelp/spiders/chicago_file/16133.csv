Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Four of us had dinner at Lou's. Ordered a family bowl of their house salad and a medium deep dish veggie. Very fresh ingredients. Friendly service. Good Pizza, great crust. Not sure if worth the long wait, however. Tips: get there early since wait time is long - 1.5 hours at 8pm on a Monday. Pre-order about 45 mins ahead while you wait to save time.
