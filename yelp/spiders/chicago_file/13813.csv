Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Amazing deep dish pizza. Try the "Lou". It is worth the wait. The server let us know up front that it would take 30-40 minutes for the pizza to be cooked and be served, which was great as we ordered an appetizer, bruschetta, also excellent. Very crowded for a Tuesday evening. The food was incredible. Service was great. The only reason this isn't a five star review is the tables are really close together and if you have a large group seated near you, you can pretty much forget about a quiet dinner.
