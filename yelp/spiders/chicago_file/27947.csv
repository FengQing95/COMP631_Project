Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The 2 star's are for the manager Sam as she really impressed me with how she handled my complaint. She was very nice and professional. She could have gotten offended or been rude but instead took it in stride and genuinely wanted to look into the issue. She definitely needs to be giving lessons to the other managers on conflict resolution. Especially the manager working the evening of 10-2-17.
