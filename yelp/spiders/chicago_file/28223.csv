Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////A lot of people will say they know the best deep dish and unless they are talking about Lou's, they are incorrect. The butter crust is crispy and flaky, the cheese warm and filling, the sausage full of flavor. They may not have invented deep dish but they sure made it perfect.
