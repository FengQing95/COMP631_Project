Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went here for the first time a few weeks ago and will definitely go back - everything from the service to the food was fantastic! There was a pretty large group of us but 2-3 plates of each was more than enough. We had the garlic potato salad, the spinach and manchego-stuffed mushrooms, seared salmon with kale, fried calamari, chicken & ham croquetas, chicken and chorizo sausage skewers and, for dessert, the flan, dark chocolate crema, and marcona almond-caramel bar.
