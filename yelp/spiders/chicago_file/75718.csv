Little Goat Diner////was so greasy she ate only half and did not take it home. Too overdone with butter and, it was burnt. My son ordered the meat concoction that had a goat burger, lamb, roast beef topped with a toasted roll and a fried onion ring. Totally too much, if you are into meat gluttony! BTW, the meat in the Reuben is not corned beef! It's roast beef and definitely would Not order. What is a Reuben w/o corned beef?
