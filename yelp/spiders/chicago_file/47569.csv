Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love tapas - my favorite way to eat is grazing...a little bit of this, a little bit of that...and this place delivers. Service at the bar was great before our meal. They have a nice wine selection and some deliciously fruity sangria choices. We enjoyed the passion fruit and blackberry versions very much!
