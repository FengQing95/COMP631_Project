Smoque BBQ////I ordered the pulled pork platter with macaroni and cheese and beans which came with coleslaw. My husband ordered the brisket platter with fries and coleslaw and beans. He also ordered gumbo over rice which had chicken sausage and beef I believe. Â We also took an order of ribs home to go.
