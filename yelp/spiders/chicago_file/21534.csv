Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We came here for lunch, because it was walking distance from our hotel and had really great ratings. My husband was craving a deep dish Chicago pizza, I just wanted a salad and my son wanted a pizza. They had an awesome lunch special with drinks, personal pizza and a salad. My three year old son and I split our meal. My husband said it was okay, but would have probably been better if we had ordered a whole pizza and split it. He said it wasn't the same. I don't know, because I've never had one before, and I wasn't in the mood to try it.
