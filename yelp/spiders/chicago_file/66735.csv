Little Goat Diner////Went to Little Goat with an old friend expecting the best and felt disappointed afterwards. We had the Bull's Eye French Toast, Smoked Fries, and the Fork Pork Chop, all of which came recommended by our server (who was super cool, btw). It was really standard fare and nothing really blew us away. The kimchi in the pork chop was over-salted and the fried chicken tasted like it came from a Tyson bag...but worse. I did really enjoy the Iced Little Goat (latte with goat's milk), which was delightfully rich and delicious. However, I don't think it's worth coming back for the food.
