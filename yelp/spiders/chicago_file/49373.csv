Smoque BBQ////Food was great - loved the brisket and pulled pork as well as the sides we ordered from the regular menu (beans, slaw and mac & cheese, which came out in its own little dish rather than just a scoop from a big pan of it), but the special side of brisket chili just didn't do anything for me.
