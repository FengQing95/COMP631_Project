Smoque BBQ////The side dishes are simply alright.  A little bit small if you ask me.  They are all served in little tinfoil cups, except for the beans and cole slaw, which are served in the classy styro containers. The beans are made with chunks of chopped brisket and are definitely the best option of the few.  For dessert, Smoque offers a peach cobbler served in the same tinfoil cup.  Not bad, just tossed up there on the menu.
