Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////You must try the Chicago Classic. It is less of a pizza, and more of a tower of flavors, with a dish of dough, a blanket of mozzarella, a river of tomatoes, and an entire layer of uninterrupted patty-style sausage. This pizza defined Chicago deep dish for me. At 1am on a Thursday in Chicago, I tasted real pizza for the first time.
