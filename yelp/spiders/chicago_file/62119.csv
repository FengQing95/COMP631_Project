Smoque BBQ////Their chopped beef brisket is moist and tender, it is as if it's melting in your mouth, but make sure you eat it while it's still warm. Their Texas sausage got this smoked flavor to it that you know it's been cooked right. Â As for the side, their fresh cut fries are pretty good, and I really like their peach cobbler, the crust and the peach just make a good combination. Overall, I always have a wonderful experience with this place. This is a must go-to place for any BBQ lovers.
