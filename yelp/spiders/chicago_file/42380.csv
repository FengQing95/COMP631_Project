Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I went here on a first date, and we ordered a pitcher of the passion fruit sangrias. He had been there about 4 times, and being new to the area, I gave minimal input. They have something for everyone so you really can't go wrong. Everything we ordered was delicious, from the spicy potatoes, to the bacon wrapped dates, and the deviled egg (which you must get even if you don't like eggs, TRUST me on this one because anything with bacon on it has to be good) it was delicious.
