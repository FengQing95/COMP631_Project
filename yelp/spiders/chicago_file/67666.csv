Little Goat Diner////I was SO SO excited to try this place. Heck I even wanted to have my friends treat me to this place for my birthday. So glad that I didn't because I would not have wanted to wait for a seat for almost 2 hours. Granted, we went there in a group of 5 on the Memorial Day weekend... Not that I am an expert in seat arrangement/management, I thought that they could do a better job forecasting the turnover rate and seating people based on the party size.
