Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's is the place to go for classic Chicago deep dish pizza. Their dense, buttery crust is scrumptious! The Lou pizza is my personal favorite! Spinach mix, mushrooms and sliced roma tomatoes covered with mozzarella, romano and cheddar cheese on a buttery crust. Yum!
