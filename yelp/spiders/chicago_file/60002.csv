Smoque BBQ////On both of our visits to Smoque we were greeted by a line that made it almost out the door. They do a good job and getting peoples order taken and getting them seated so it's never been an issue.  Plus you gotta think if people are willing stand in line to get some BBQ it either must be really good or the people standing in line must be really stupid.  I don't think they're stupid.
