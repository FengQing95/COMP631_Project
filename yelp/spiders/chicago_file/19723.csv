Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We went on a Monday night around 8, expecting there wouldn't be that much of a wait on a Monday so late. Boy were we wrong. The hostess said there would be an hour wait, but we could order it to go and have the food within 30 minutes. We went with this offer originally, but once we realized how cold it was outside, we decided to ask to hostess to put us on the wait for a table. About 30 minutes we, we decided to check in to see how much longer the wait with. Apparently there was a mix up and our name was taken off the list completely. They said they would solve it and get us a table soon. About 30 minutes later, we asked about for the approximate wait. They had never solved the issue.
