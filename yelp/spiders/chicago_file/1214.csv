Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////We used the Nowait app, though it only has restaurants in the Chicago area. We had the Garden Skillet, Wild Pan crepes with fresh glazed strawberries, and the silver dollar pancakes. The whipped cream on the side had no sugar, it was bland and flavorless. However, the whipped cream on the crepes was good. The Garden Skillet was tasty with a lot of veggies. Silver dollar pancakes were excellent, coffee is good. Would come back. We reserved a spot in line with the Nowait app, and it was about a five minute wait. It was approximately a ten minute wait from when we ordered to our food getting here. It was crowded, but the service was fast. The only complaint is that the portions were big and we had leftovers.
