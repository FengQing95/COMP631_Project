Smoque BBQ////Love the brisket sandwhich, mac&cheese, and slaw.  Kids enjoy the peach cobbler.  The baby-back ribs also rock.  Plan ahead since parking and waits can get long and you don't want to feel rushed when enjoying slow-cooked BBQ.  It's delicious!  Note - BYOB, they have church keys you can borrow.
