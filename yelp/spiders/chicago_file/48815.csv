Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went here for dinner after a show.  The food was very good and the atmosphere was fun.  We ordered several rounds of topas and they all came out quickly.  The lamb and beef were really great.  The food was all fresh and flavorful.  Regardless of the following comments, I would for sure recommend it for anyone.  But, as an added benefit, there was a Celiac and two people that eat gluten free with us.  There was a separate gluten free menu.  The waiter was extremely knowledgeable on these topics.  He was very careful and no one had any issues afterwards.
