Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The salad was pretty good, nice ingredients and it was BIG for the small serving. The family size was gigantic. Get the smaller one and you will have more than enough for two people.We pre-ordered our pizza, so it came out pretty quickly. It was the perfect Chicago style pizza. Nice flavors, crust actually had flavor enough to want to eat it and was a nice texture.
