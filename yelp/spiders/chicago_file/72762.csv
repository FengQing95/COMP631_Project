Little Goat Diner////I went to the opening today and expected things to be a little out of sync but was pleasantly surprised by the helpful and attentive staff.  We placed a large to go order to bring back to the office and it was handled perfectly.  It was a amazing to see Chef Izard in the kitchen making our sandwiches herself!  Everything was fantastic but the stand out for me was the chili with "pizza poofs" and the shrimp sandwich which was clean with a hint of heat.  The crispy masa chip was the perfect touch for texture.
