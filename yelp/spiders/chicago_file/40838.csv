Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////After some shopping around the area, we stopped by Cafe Ba Ba Reeba at around 9pm on a Friday night, and the place was PACKED! We were certain that we wouldn't need reservations for a 9pm dinner, but no such luck--there was barely any room to move around! However, we were able to find seats at the bar and enjoyed a meal of delicious sangrias, tapas, and good company.
