Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My friends and I LOVE tapas restaurants because we get to try a ton of different items rather than sticking to one dish each. This is a great place for a group - I came here on a Sunday during brunch time with 4 other people, one of whom had lived in Spain and was very excited to sample some Spanish dishes. The white sangria is peachy, sweet, and refreshing. The 5 of us had shared the sausage-fried paella, spinach and artichoke crepe (my favorite), tortilla espa√±ola (my friend that lived in Spain HAD to have this and she loved it!), shrimp and grits, patatas bravas, beef tenderloin benedict, and the citrus/goat cheese French toast. This was just the right amount of food for us - the dishes were a bit small, so we each got about two or three substantial bites from each plate. We got a free dessert dish from checking into yelp, so we picked the salted butterscotch pudding as the perfect bite to end the brunch. The only complaint I'd have is that some of the dishes are a bit bland, but I feel that's the nature of Spanish cooking itself more than a reflection on the restaurant. All-in-all, I'd go back with a large group again, especially since there are more things on the menu I want to try!
