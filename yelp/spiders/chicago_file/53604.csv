Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////An awesome place for a date or for a big group outing. The menu has a lot to offer and there's always something new to try! The bacon wrapped dates are amazing. A few of my favorites are the spicy potatoes, scallop empanadas, calamari, ham croquettes, and buttermilk fried chicken. You really cannot go wrong here. The sangria is amazing too.
