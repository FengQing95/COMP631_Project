Little Goat Diner////One of my favorite places in Chicago. I don't particularly like dinners as they are often associated with greasy food with overwhelming large portions of it. Though, this place is different. It has the culture of a dinner, in terms of friendly faces and ambience. The menu is a global culinary spin on traditional diner food offering an eclectic combination of delicious entrees and treats. Highly recommend this place for family, friends, and even a casual date. My two favorite entrees are the French toast with egg and fried chicken and the paratha. As someone that loves spicy food, I learned the hard way with "this little piggy went to China" entree that I don't like fresh schezwan peppers- the numbed my entire mouth. That's just me though! My husband and brother loved the dish!
