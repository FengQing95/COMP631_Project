Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Their interior deco is not very breakfast-y but it certainly looked good, and I liked the fact that they get their coffee from an actual coffee shop which you can visit if you want some caffeine to go at the front. If you're in the area I would highly recommend Wildberry for breakfast especially over those numerous "corner bakeries" you see in the city.
