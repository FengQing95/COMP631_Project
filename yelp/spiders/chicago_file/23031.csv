Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have to say I've had better pizza... but they offer a gluten free crust and eating out with GF friends is difficult as is, so Lou's it was. They were nice. The butter crust was ok. The sauce was ok. Honestly it reminded me of pizza hut and that's probably not a good thing. The seating is good for one-four people, the larger groups looked uncomfortable.
