Art Institute of Chicago////Museums are a must for me when traveling, yep I'm that lame, lol. As an art fan I was soo excited to go here and it certainly did not disappoint! Â I found myself thinking "this is better than the Met." Yup, you outdid NY with this one Chicago. So many famous pieces I lost count, def nice to see them in person instead of an art book. The layout and traveling thru floors was a bit confusing, but aren't most museums? If I lived in the Chi you'd prob find me here every month!
