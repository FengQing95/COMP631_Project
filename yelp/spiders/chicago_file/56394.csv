Smoque BBQ////I went to Kansas City on business last year and the one thing I took away from this city is my deep affection for KC barbecue. I had it both days that I was there, and I dreamt about it for months after. My gosh, I crave that barbecue like a crazy person. The delicious smoked flavor of the meat has lingered with me and refuses to let go. So I've bitten my nails, chewed gum, chugged water, and have pretty much done anything to stop myself from jumping on a plane just to have dinner there.
