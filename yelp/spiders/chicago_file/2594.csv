The Purple Pig////Drinks: The aforementioned amazing server handed me an enormous drink menu while they were bussing my table so I was able to get a drink in hand ASAP. I started off with the "espanola" ($13) a fabulous spritz style cocktail that paired well with food. Round two was the "Two Six" ($13) gin and citrus drink. Though refreshing, it wasn't the best choice for a dinner drink. Good for a pre-dinner next time.
