Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My wife and I showed up without a reservation (I would recommend you make one), and the staff was kind enough to show us to their downstairs bar while we waited.  The vibe downstairs is super cool and fun.  I had the best Manhattan I've had in quite a while and my wife's Whiskey Smash was also exceptional.  But none of this compares to how excellent the food was.  We liked it so much we tried to get back there every night for more.
