Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The stuffed spinach bread came out in less than ten minutes.  It tasted great, maybe because we were so hungry.  The bread was soft, and as you ripped a piece off, cheese oozed out.  It was seasoned perfectly, and was devoured in a quicker time than it did to bake the thing.
