Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The first time I was in Chicago, I tried Giordano's and was fairly underwhelmed by the experience. Enter Lou Malnati's. THAT BUTTER CRUST. So good. I regret not getting more toppings, but I'm glad to have gotten one thing right, which is that butter crust. Highly recommended. Even better that that my friend and I got to watch the game 2 of Kings-Rangers in double overtime while enjoying local brews (Goose Island and 312).
