Smoque BBQ////You can't get anything bad at this place. And their ordering system is efficient. Order and then get seated. Weekend lines can get long but it moves relatively fast. Love their brisket, pulled pork, and ribs, though I usually get the brisket. Their fries are crunchy, the mac and cheese is so rich it hurts your chest if you eat it too fast, and their cole slaw has that brightness tang to cut through all the heaviness of the other foods. Solid place, consistently good.
