Art Institute of Chicago////Home to the classic American works of art such as The American Gothic and Nighthawks, the Art Institute is one of the more incredible museums I've ever been.  With Seurat's Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte and several pieces of Van Gogh, Cezanne, and Monet, it was an art lover's paradise.
