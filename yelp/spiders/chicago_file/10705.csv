Art Institute of Chicago////Even though I've lived in Chicago for serval years, this was my first time visiting the art institute. I came here on a Saturday on a rainy day and there was a long line for tickets (took us about 20 minutes to get through). Price for tickets is $20 for Illinois residents (make sure you have some form of proof). Apparently many Thursday's are free in the evening for Illinois residents. I don't know really anything about art but was impressed by how expansive the museum is. There is SO much to see here - you can seriously spend hours (I think it took us 4+ hours to get through most of it and I'm sure there was still more to see). I liked the variety of exhibits and although I couldn't appreciate some of the artwork fully (probably because again I know next to nothing about art) it was just nice to do something different. The museum is well organized and well maintained. I probably wouldn't come back any time soon but would recommend it to others atleast to visit once.
