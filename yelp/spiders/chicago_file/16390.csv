Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We shared the Classic Lou and the Sausage pizza between four people. The flavor of the cheese and topping were pretty good - ooey gooey cheese, just the way I like it. But the crust!! The crust was so doughy and seemed undercooked. Both the pizzas tasted like this so could this be a fluke? They came at vastly different times so I don't think they were cooked together... Anyways, I literally felt like we were eating a pizza "pie"...with a crumbly pie crust. To be more precise, the crust had the consistency of a scone. Bad. Â
