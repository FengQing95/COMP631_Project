Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Steakhouse - Reserve a booth! Looking for a nice cocktail, stop here. Great bartenders.   Best dark & stormy!  Nice whiskey selection. The bone marrow appetizers was delicious.  The pork chop is tender and recommended but the aged prime ribeye is everyone's favorite.   Melt in your mouth good.  Pair that with their buttery mashed potatoes and you're almost there. Don't pass up the desserts.   I'll be back.
