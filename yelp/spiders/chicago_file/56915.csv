Smoque BBQ////It was my first time there. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with slaw and fries, and I added a taste of the sliced brisket. My total came to about $13. We were seated after ordering and waited for our number to be called. When our food was ready, my first impression was how small the sides were. I tasted the coleslaw first and thought it was a little on the sour side. Â At this point you're probably wondering why I gave this place five stars.
