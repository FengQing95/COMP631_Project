Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place has always been crowded on Friday and Saturday nights, and this Friday night was certainly no exception.  The wait for a table at 7:30 without a reservation was over an hour.  We ended up getting a couple of seats at the bar and eating there, which was comfortable enough.  The bar staff now mostly consists of guys that used to be bussers in my day - which is a good thing.  They know their stuff, they're very courteous and attentive and their presence there makes much more sense to the feel of the place than mine ever did behind the bar.  It's also good to see that they promote from within.
