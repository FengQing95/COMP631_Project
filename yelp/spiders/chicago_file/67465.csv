Little Goat Diner////I went to Little Goat about a week ago and had a great time.  The weather was clear but just a bit on the cool side, and this allowed us to get immediate outdoor seating.  I ordered the Goat Almighty burger and was completely floored with the sheer size of the thing.  The toppings and bun are loosely stacked, centered over the burger with the help of a wooden skewer.  The resulting assembly is easily eight inches tall.
