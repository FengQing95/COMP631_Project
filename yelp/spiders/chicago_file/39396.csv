Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Food: I mean, do I even need to explain? We ordered a half size roasted tomato bacon salad and the crab stuffed avocado salad to start. Both salads were interesting and tasted great, but the roasted tomato bacon really took the cake for me. The thick cut bacon with that roasted tomato was such a beautiful blend of salty and sweet. For the mains, we got the classic Chicago ribeye and the bone-in NY strip with sides of mashed potato and wild mushrooms. The steaks were cooked through to a perfect medium rare, and they were seasoned stellarly. They come with a side of bearnaise, but I really didn't need it because the meat itself was so tasty. The mashed potatoes... COME TO MAMA. They're whipped with roasted garlic on top in a chicken jus. I couldn't stop licking them off my fork. The mushrooms were topped with herbs and were good but nothing more than sauteed mushrooms really. Finally, for dessert, we ordered what turned out to be a MASSIVE slice of lemon meringue pie. And it was delicious. I love that dessert doesn't seem like an afterthought here.
