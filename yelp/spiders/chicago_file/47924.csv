Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I live close to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba and have been a handful of times. I've tried a lot of their menu items and really liked the proscuitto wrapped dates, the goat cheese and tomato sauce, and the croquettes. It is slightly overpriced for what you get and it adds up fast. Also, they took churros off the dessert menu, which should be considered a sin.
