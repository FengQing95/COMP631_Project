Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went last night around 7:30 and the place was alive and full of people. Sat at the bar to watch the Warriors game. Ordered a pitcher of Sangria which was awesome. Not too sweet and it was obvious they used quality wine to make it. Ordered a chicken empanada and goat cheese dip with marinara sauce. It's a tapas bar. The empanada crust was so flaky and buttery I wanted to go in the kitchen and scream" who made this" and when they point to this human, I would jump on him and kiss him on his forehead. Yes, it was just that amazing. The goat cheese was gooey and smooth. And the sauce was like it came from someone's kitchen name Maria. Must go and kiss the chef on the forehead for me !
