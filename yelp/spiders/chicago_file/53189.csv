Smoque BBQ////I was in the mood for some good BBQ while on my recent trip to Chicago. Oh My Goodness, this was some of the best food I have had. I got the Pulled pork with a side of baked beans and macaroni and cheese. Everything was delicious and it was very hard to find a suggestion for improvement. Order at the counter and the host will help you find a seat.
