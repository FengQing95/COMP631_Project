Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The wait was of course super long. For a party of seven, we were 36th in line. However, they did give us the option to pre-order our pizza in advance so that the wait time is shortened when we get seated. The ambiance is very nice, and the upstairs level resembles an authentic Italian restaurant. We ordered two medium pizzas of The Classic and the Lou, and we didn't even get to finish! The pizza was AMAZING!! I loved it even without pineapple (and that's saying a lot) Our waitress Jessie was also awesome and funny!
