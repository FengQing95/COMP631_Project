Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Steak: Dry Aged Bone in Ribeye, Medium with the added butter garlic sauce. The steak lacked salt. So we had to add the finishing herbs with salt to get the taste we wanted. Be the way, the busboy gave us the herbs with salt on the side and never explained what the hell it was. We shared this and it came out cut in 5 parts. wish they only did 1 cut so the juices did not run.
