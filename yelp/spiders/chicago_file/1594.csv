Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The wait is very long, but worth it. Use yelp's 'add me to the waitlist' feature to save some time. They are pretty efficient at getting people in and out. The restaurant is clean and tidy, but feels casual, like a couple steps above an iHOP. The food, however, is fantastic. I got the special of 2 eggs, 2 sides, and 2 pancakes. The signature berry bliss pancakes are a must. They are sweet but tart and incredibly fluffy. The melt-in-your-mouth pancakes come with fresh fruit and are heavenly. If you're not into sweetness, go for the buttermilk pancakes, equally as delicious. Their hash browns are definitely worth it - but are considerably under salted. But don't worry - they keep salt on the table. If you're two people who aren't too hungry- i would opt for splitting a skillet with a side of pancakes, still a filling meal for two. Whatever you do, though, it's essential that the pancakes are a part of it. I would definitely come back!
