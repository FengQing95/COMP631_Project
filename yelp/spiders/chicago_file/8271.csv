Art Institute of Chicago////Next I went to the Hopper/Winslow exhibits.  Fantastic!  The Hopper one I thought I would enjoy more b/c I'm a fan of his and I loathe watercolors.  When in fact, the Hopper exhibit seemed to focus too much on the painting that they have there ALL THE TIME.  The Winslow exhibit was quaint and peaceful.  I enjoyed looking at the detail of his watercolors.
