Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This might be the most unique and cultured steak house in Chicago. It is for those who want their steak in an intimate and continental atmosphere. We loved Bavette's. Downstairs is dark and romantic. Our table had oysters (great), Steaks (great) meatloaf, (?) and a Berkshire Pork Chop (fantastic). Do order the duck confit too.
