Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My review is on their suburban delivery service - not the Wells St sit-down. LOCAL delivery service is superb .  And their app is amazing!  They ask if you want it pre-cut.  Why?  It effects how well it travels, they said. Who knew?!  And they put a piece of saran wrap on top which keeps it so hot. Why doesn't anyone else do that?  I'm a convert.
