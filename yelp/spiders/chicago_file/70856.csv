Little Goat Diner////Our server was Sean, and he was AWESOME!  Friendly, attentive, helpful.  Huge thumbs up!  We ordered a lot for three people:  waffles and chicken, omelet of the day (crab ragoon version----yep!), pancakes for child, and sides of potatoes, and sausages.  Ohhhh... plus a cinnamon roll.  You are now thinking what I am thinking....I will not be eating again for a week.  Everything was quite good.  Breakfast cocktails were adequate but not amazing.  My daughter loved her hot chocolate, which was served with a lovely swirl on top.
