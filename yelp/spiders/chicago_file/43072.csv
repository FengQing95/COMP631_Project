Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The paella is excellent (generally).  It runs the risk of being bland sometimes, but I would never tell someone who's never had it to skip it.  The catch is it takes a while to order it and the real problem can arise when you order the paella at the start of the meal and forget about it...then continue to order tapas.  When the paella does show up, everyone's too full eat it!
