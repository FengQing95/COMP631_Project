Little Goat Diner////What a cute place... I went here for a breakfast meeting around 8 and the diner was pretty empty.   The service was outstanding and our server was so knowledgeable about the menu.   If I didn't have to go do a full days work I would have chosen one of the heavier dishes to try.  Instead I went with poached eggs, yogurt and toast.  For being a simple order, it was probably one of the best breakfasts I have had.  Delish!  Everything was cooked to perfection and the bread was so fresh.  I will be back to try many of the the other unique items on the menu.
