Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Whenever I am in the Chicago area, I visit Lou's at least once.  I cannot say that for some of the other famous Chicago pizza chains. I love their deep dish pizza with a local craft beer.  It doesn't matter what you get, just get there and get yourself some of this legendary Chicago style pizza.
