Smoque BBQ////After several visits to Smoque, I've decided that a review needed to be concocted.  Am I going to tell you to not believe the hype?  To stop wasting your time waiting in line for an hour to get a big pile of brisket?  I'm afraid not.  However, I do have some fundamental issues to address in terms of Smoque's food, identity, authenticity and ambiance.
