Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our waiter was attentive, very knowledgeable about the menu and made some great recommendations. He was also easily able to tell me what on the menu I was or was not allergic to. Â There was some confusion as to who our waiter was when we came in. My friend and I didn't have an issue with this as the wait was still small and the service after the issue was sorted out was so perfect that it more than made up for the slight lack, for this we were comped our sangria and our deserts.
