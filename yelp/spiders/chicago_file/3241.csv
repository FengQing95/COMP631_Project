The Purple Pig////Start off..I have no idea how my boyfriend and I got seated right away. We literally walked in around 9pm on a Saturday night and got a table for 2 with no reservation. We came to aim for the bar but was totally surprised about having a table. After we got seated, there was a line formed so we got hella lucky to beat the crowd. This is just nuts considering this was our second dinner for the day!
