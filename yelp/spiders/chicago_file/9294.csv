Art Institute of Chicago////This is a great museum all around, and every time I visit I seem to see whole sections I had previously missed. The works by Magritte, O'Keeffe, Matisse, Picasso, Pollock, Degas, Monet, Renoir, Cézanne, and so many others make it one of the most comprehensive museums I've visited. Picasso's 'The Old Guitarist', Seurat's 'Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte', and Wood's 'American Gothic' are standouts.
