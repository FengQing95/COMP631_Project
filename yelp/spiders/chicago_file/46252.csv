Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Being a tapas restaurant isn't as easy as simple as putting a tapas sign on the front of your restaurant. You have to create the experience of tapas. A laid back casual atmosphere which allows you to enjoy food, drink, and company at your own leisure. While Ba-Ba-Reeba might have the menu of a tapas restaurant or bar it certainly does not have the atmosphere nor the taste to go with it.
