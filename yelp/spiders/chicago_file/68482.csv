Little Goat Diner////Only been there once, but I need to go back and try the other amazing-sounding menu items. The Goat Chili was incredible - great flavors and wonderful garnish. Braised beef sandwich was beautifully presented and a very unique take on a french dip. Fries look simple but have a great smoky flavor. Overall, not what I expected and I can't wait to go again.
