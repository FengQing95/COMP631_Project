Little Goat Diner////Came yesterday right before a Blackhawks game. It was a Monday late afternoon so wasn't super busy. Â Got seated right away. Our server gave us plenty of time to look over the menu. (We were quite indecisive!) He also chatted and cracked a few jokes with us, which was nice. We ended up getting the hot crab dip with Ritz crackers. Soooo delicious! Was hot and bubbly when it came out. Do ask for more crackers - 8 is not enough. Mac 'n cheese was divine. Love the bread crumbs on top. And the Reuben sandwich. Very interesting taste with kimchi inside. All in all, a good "diner" experience! The bathrooms are really clean and nice, too.
