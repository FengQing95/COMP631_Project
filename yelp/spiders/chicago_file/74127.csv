Little Goat Diner////Made reservations for my husband and I and was seated right away. However, it took 10 minutes to get water and another 5 for the waitress to introduce herself, this is not an exaggeration, just facts. Another 10 minutes for my waitress to come back with our drink order and finally take our food order.  She asked me what I wanted in a rushed way and when I was done, she grabbed my menu and my husband's, didn't say a word, and walked away....COMPLETELY FORGETTING TO TAKE MY HUSBAND'S ORDER. We had to wave her down 5 minutes later to order and for this she apologized so we let that go. So by the time we put in our full order, we had been sitting in the restaurant for 30 Minutes. The only reason I stayed and did not leave mid dinner was the fact that people raved about the food...This I concur,  is true. Food was delicious, innovative,  and very unique.  I had the pork belly fries with the grilled cheese and it was the BEST thing I've ever eaten in a while.  The only reason I even wanted to give this place a second chance was for their glorious food...which leads me to my second chance visit.
