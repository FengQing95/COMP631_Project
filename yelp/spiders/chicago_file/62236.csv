Smoque BBQ////The barbecue here is great. It's not a sitdown place, you are your food at the counter and then pick it up and say where you like. very busy place, give yourself a little extra time if you're going to eat here. Menu isn't that large but there's many great things to choose from. Our food came out fast and hot which is always a plus. The brisket was great melts in your mouth like none other I've had before. they only had one barbecue sauce, for a barbecue place you think they'd have more options.The barbecue beans are awesome to pull pork sandwich was great. Mac & cheese was well done to simple but elegant. Fast Â clean and friendly. Highly recommend trying this place if you're in the area, especially if you're in the barbecue.
