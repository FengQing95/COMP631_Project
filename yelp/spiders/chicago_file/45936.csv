Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I never really liked the concept of tapas, it just seems like I'm being cheated since all the portions are so small. The dishes here were worth it though and tasty to boot. The paella was a little oily in my opinion but still good nonetheless. As far as the sangria goes, I've had better. Cafe Iberico comes to mind and frankly the sangria at Weber Grill stands out before Ba-ba-reeba's, Not a bad place but I think it'll be a while until I go for tapas again.
