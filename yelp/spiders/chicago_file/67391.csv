Little Goat Diner////No, actually, I've never met her, but I have been to Girl & The Goat, and was not impressed. After a night of beers and Mortal Kombat at The Emporium (cool place!), decided to have late night diner food at Little Goat. A friend told us about it, and it was like, "Ok, cool, let's go!" But only afterwards did I find out how popular this place was! So, like a madman, I ordered everything that I saw mentioned more than once on Yelp, and ironically, the one 10/10 item here wasn't one I ordered. :/
