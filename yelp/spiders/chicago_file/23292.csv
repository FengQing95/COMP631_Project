Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I usually come to eat pizza after gym! I know I shouldn't been eating pizza but Lou is always so attempting. I love love!!! The full appetizer with fried mozzarella, mushroom, and zucchini with red sauce and ranch. I can imagine myself eating it now. The Chicago Classic is the way to go because I love sausage and the crust is crispy as well! I cannot complain. I also got the pasta but they don't have Mariana meat sauce pasta anymore. Thumbs up!!!
