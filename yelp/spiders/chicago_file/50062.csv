Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Didn't try the table's mac n cheese, pancakes, chicken on a stick (deep fried), goat cheese w/bread, nor the paella/rice dish but the goat cheese was the group favorite among those. The calamari was good, but I would probably try the scallops in place of it next time. The spicy potatoes came with a delicious sherry aioli and a tomato aioli. I would have eaten the aioli with a spoon rather than let it go to waste b/c it was so good, but I was too full. Onto Dessert!
