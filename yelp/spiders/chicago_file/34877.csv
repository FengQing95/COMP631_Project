Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Best bone-in filet my bf has ever had! Tender, well seasoned... He had it done medium rare plus.. Delicious. Possibly the best steak he's ever had. Also ordered the baked sweet potato, which was two large sweet potatoes cut in half with cinnamon  brown sugar... I enjoyed it. It's not super sweet. Just right in my opinion. My bf wished it had more sugar and cinnamon though.  I also ordered smoked whitefish Caesar was very rich and flavored. We would definitely go back here on our visit to Chicago !! Also go early within an hour before ordering to avoid a long wait.
