Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This particular location (439 Wells) had some terrible service, however. I was thankful for the very large glass of water that I requested, but I didn't particularly enjoy having to wait an additional 20 minutes after our remaining food was packed up to have the check brought to us. Our pizzas took a solid hour to be brought out, as well. I understand that it was a busy afternoon, but I'd have appreciated at least a status update while I'm sitting there starving.
