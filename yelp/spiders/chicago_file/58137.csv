Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We ordered the happy hour sangria pitcher (16 dollars) and several of the tapas. The bacon wrapped dates were AMAZING!  Other items were good as well but get the dates. We also had a dessert tapa which is how all desserts should be served.  Also saw you can get a free dessert tapa for checking in on yelp which I didn't see but definitely will next time!
