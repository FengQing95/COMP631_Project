Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Wow. This pizza ticks all the boxes for an absolutely delicious, decadent, crunchy, juicy, savory Chicago style pie. Rarely is it so evident that every component is made in house. Generous meat placement and sauce/cheese coverage, crunchy crust on bottom and sides. The service was also amazing. Delightful in every way.
