Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We went for a birthday dinner and I thought the food was good.  The environment in the restaurant is pretty cool and the wait staff was good.  We tried their sangria, which was ok, and ordered a few tapas before we had paella.  My parents said it is not exactly like a restaurant in Spain, which had awesome paella, but it was still pretty good.
