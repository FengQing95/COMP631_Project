The Purple Pig////No surprise, but it was cold outside. I would like to give a huge shoutout to JOSIE for being an amazing waitress!! She casually approached my friend and I and gave us some wonderful tips. She told us the wait time is actually quicker than it is and we should just put our name down on the list. She also made the effort to try to get us seated inside by the bar. She was very attentive towards us and exemplified quality customer service! She started off with a bottle of wine as we waited. She was not our server when we got seated inside, but she was very sweet towards us while we were waiting outside. You're the best, Josie!
