Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our server was great, super nice and attentive. The food was delicious as well, I got the rib eye steak which was a solid 8.5/10, the crab cake was just WOW WOW WOW. Best crab cake I've ever had in my life solid 12/10. The sorbet ice cream at the end was very good as well, nothing mind blowing but then again it's ice cream so it's pretty standard
