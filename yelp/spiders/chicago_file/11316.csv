Art Institute of Chicago////Only little negative comment that I want to make is that in the section where Asian art was displayed, I believe the Korean category was a little lacking. I am Korean so it could definitely be a bias statement but the amount of art depicting Korean history was definitely a lot smaller than the rest.
