Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Like everyone else has said, the food is delicious. Like, seriously delicious. The bread is heavenly, the goat cheese and marinara appetizer was a hit, and the buttermilk fried chicken (the few bites we could manage after filling up on everything else) was crispy and tasty. Cocktails are delicious, but don't expect large portions. A sip or two plus a large block of ice is what you will get, and you will pay a pretty penny for it. The primary reason I can't give it five stars is for the attitude of the staff. We arrived without a reservation, and when we put our name on the list for a table and asked about the wait, the hostess told us with her nose semi-in-the-air, "we typically don't quote times." What?! Seriously? You are a restaurant. Please don't be so trendy that you are too cool for school.
