Little Goat Diner////that is how i feel about this place. service was average to good but the food was a little crazy. you can't really go wrong with tonkatsu but they made it into a sandwich.  with just plain white bread.  so it consisted of cheap tonkatsu (cheap cause it's thin and doesn't have a lot of meat inside the batter) and they just put 2 slices of toasted white bread (without the crumbs so thumbs up for that).
