Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Phenomenal breakfast with very friendly wait staff and employees. I ordered an omelette with goat cheese, sharp cheddar, and bacon. The goat cheese was very creamy and light and fit very well with the omelette. My wife ordered the brisket with sausage gravy. It sounds like an odd combination, but it was very tasty. You definitely won't leave hungry at this restaurant. We would highly recommend using the wait list as it can be a 2 hour wait at times.
