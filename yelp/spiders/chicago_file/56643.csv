Smoque BBQ////We went on a Friday night around 7pm. There was a decent line out the door and it moved relatively fast. About a 20 minute wait in total. Completely worth it for the awesomeness ahead. If you want the line to seem faster, bring some drinks with you. Its a BYOB which makes the awesomeness ahead even better!
