Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered for starters the calamari, caesar salad, cheese bread with dipping sauce, and a bottle of red wine. The calamari and the caesar salad were fantastic. We could have done without the cheese bread. We ordered 3 medium pizzas. The Lou, The Malnati Chicago Classic, and The Sausage thin crust pizza. Hands down, The Thin Crust Sausage Pizza was the top favorite for our table of 5 people. The 2nd choice was The Malnati Chicago Classic. The Lou, we could have done without. The crust is amazing good. So buttery and it just melts in your mouth good. The pizzas are very filling, so we ended up taking 1 1/2 pizza's home.
