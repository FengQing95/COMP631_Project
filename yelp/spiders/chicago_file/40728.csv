Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ate here for the first time this weekend and it was fantastic.  My husband had never had tapas before and admitted to being a "little scared", but afterward, he said it was the best meal he's had in a long time - maybe ever.  We had 6 different tapas and the mango sangria and all were delicious.  Love the atmosphere.  Very romantic place to go on a date if you like to be amongst some noise.  Can't wait to go back!
