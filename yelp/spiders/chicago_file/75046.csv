Little Goat Diner////Little Goat is a classy, upscale-ish diner and bakery. The food is really lovely. For the bakery, they have classics (croissants, muffins, etcs.) and a rotating menu of other goodies. Standouts of the seasonal offerings were the Apricot Masala scones and squash muffins. On the dessert menu, the apple and fennel pie was a wonderful variation on the American classic.
