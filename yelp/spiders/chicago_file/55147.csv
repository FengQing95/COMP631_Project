Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Hands down the best tapas and sangria I've had outside of Spain! We started with the Happy Hour deals for the Sangria and a couple small plates and then moved to a table after. The service was absolutely fabulous, the Sangria absolutely delicious and the tapas were some to the best. The ambiance 10/10. Good vegetarian and non vegetarian options and decently priced! Would definitely make a reservation before you go as this place is almost always busy.
