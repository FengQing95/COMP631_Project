Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's is my favorite deep dish pizza in Chicago, or anywhere else for that matter. Â While I'm not the biggest advocate of deep dish pizza, Lou Malnati's is best in class....the butter crust is flaky and delicious, the pepperoni was spicy enough to let it's presence be known, and it was evident that the best tomatoes were used for the sauce - they were flavorful, bright red, and the chunky sauce was generously applied.
