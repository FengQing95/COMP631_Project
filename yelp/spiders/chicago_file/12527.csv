Art Institute of Chicago////I knew I had to come visit this muesum during my trip to Chicago. This was quite the experience! Made sure to have enough time to thoroughly explore the Institute but honestly there's just so much to see. I wanted to take the time to read about & briefly discuss the pieces of art so I think for the future I would plan to focus on one floor/section per visit. With that being said, I liked that there was a "short on time" section in the guide. It listed all of the popular, "must-see" art that visitors should visit if they only have an hour to spare.
