Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////However, of the 6-7 tapas plates we tried I have to say 2 were fantastic, 2 were good, and the rest were only middling.  Oddly the best plate was also the most disappointing: The beef tenderloin with blue cheese came out with one of the two pieces cooked to rare-medium-rare perfection while the second piece was overcooked to the point that it was inedible.  A big disappointment.
