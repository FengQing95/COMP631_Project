Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I don't know if it's for the fact that I've had tapas while in Sevilla, Spain, or the food just simply isn't that good. But regardless, the experience underwhelmed. The plates were tiny, the prices for the actual dishes with subsistence were in the high range, the flavor diluted and un-authentic, and the sangrias tasted like the boxed stuff from Target.
