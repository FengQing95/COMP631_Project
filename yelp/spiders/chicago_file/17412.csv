Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My main issue (and reason for not awarding 5 stars) is that they prefer for you to place your order while your waiting.  In theory, I think this is a great concept.  Where it goes wrong is that you can only order pizza ahead.  A member of my party was planning on ordering pasta, and we had planned on an appetizer of the cheddar cubes (so good, btw) and were assured that this would come out at the same time as the pizza (even though we couldn't place this order til we got to the table).  WELL, not only did we wait 30 minutes for our table we also waited 35 minutes AT our table for the pizza.  When it came out it was DEFINITELY worth the wait but the pasta and appetizer STILL hadn't come out.  We waited an additional 20 minutes for it(while everyone else anxiously/nervously tried to eat as slow as possible so that we would still have food when the pasta came).  (And the pasta was watery and virtually tasteless when it did come. My sister waited forever for something she couldn't even eat.)
