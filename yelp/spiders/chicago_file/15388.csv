Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Cheesy cheesy hot steamy gooey deep dish goodness...wow...ordered in a large deep dish LOU's Â pizza which is..Spinach mix, mushrooms and sliced roma tomatoes covered with three cheeses...on that yeasty incredible crunchy amazing crust. I love the fact they do not precut this masterpiece to keep it juicy hot and perfect upon delivery. We had received the pizza in under 40 minutes and that first bite was like a symphony playing on your palette. Great job on creation to destination. I will be a regular for sure....if u haven't indulged as of yet...u haven't had great Chicago love yet..go for it.
