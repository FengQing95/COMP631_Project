Art Institute of Chicago////I'm not big on art museums because I'm not sure I know how to appreciate certain types of art, but I have found a few that I really love. But the Art Institute is not one of them. I spent three hours in here even though I didn't deeply analyze many paintings - that says something about the size of this museum. But in an effort to really enjoy this museum, I purchased the audio tour ($7) and I have to say - why does this even exist? First, if you have an iPhone, you can just download it on your phone, but they don't tell you that. I have an Android though, so at least it didn't make me feel worse. But why does a museum have audio tour when only what seems like one in every twenty pieces of art have some sort of audio? Clearly, it didn't help me at all and I used it four times throughout the entire museum. I really wish that the Provoke exhibit had audio. It would have made the experience here for me. Nonetheless, I highly recommend visiting the Provoke exhibit. It's intriguing and engaging.
