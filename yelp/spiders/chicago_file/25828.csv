Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Do not order from this place!! If you have any sense do not patronize such blatant discrimination! I called this place for a delivery and was told that the boundary was Talman. I asked to speak to a manager since I am only a Â block west. Some stuck up condescending punk named Sebastian had the nerve to tell me that they "don't go anywhere near Humboldt Park.. because they care of their drivers!". Apparently, they don't service 'the hood'..just 9 blocks away. Very rude and classless!
