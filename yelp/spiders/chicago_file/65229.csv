Smoque BBQ////I've tried both the Baby Back Ribs and the St Louis Ribs and there is a clear winner--St Loius Ribs!  I've never been to St Louis but Smoque BBQ makes me think that trip might be worth it!  The service is great and the food is even better!  Highly recommend if you're looking for food that will stick to your ribs!
