Smoque BBQ////There is absolutely no question in my mind of why the line is consistently out the door here. Their ribs are amazing, their brisket makes me drool a little bit just thinking about it, and their Memphis BBQ sauce is excellent. Trust me - it's worth the line. You might even get lucky and they'll have their pecan bread pudding for dessert.
