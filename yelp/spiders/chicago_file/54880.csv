Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Brian our server was quick with an explanation of the Tapas (small plate) concept and off to the food races we went. For the next 60 minutes or so we sampled, in no particular order: brussel sprout salad; lamb kababs; roasted bacon wrapped dates; deviled eggs; stuffed mushrooms and pork belly paella X2 (an order size well suited for us three Funksters) all outstanding and all washed down with a pitcher of possibly the best house made Red Sangria we ever swilled!
