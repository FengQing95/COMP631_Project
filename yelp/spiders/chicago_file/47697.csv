Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great tapas with my boyfriend and not too expensive. We had an awesome waitress too... I think her name was Cherie. It was pretty packed for a tuesday night which obviously shows how good the place is. We got the meatballs (delicious and full of flavor), the meat and cheese plate (YUMMMM), the pinxtos platter which had a nice variety but not much food and the calamari which my boyfriend enjoyed (I don't like fish). Definitely will visit again soon!
