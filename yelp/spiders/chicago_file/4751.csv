The Purple Pig////We ordered the bone marrow, which was delicious. Comes with toasted bread and an acidic herb salad. There's also salt to season yourself. The combination is amazing. We also had the octopus, which was super tender. The best part of the meal was probably the milk marinated short rib. It's creamy on the inside, and it completely falls apart when you stab into it with your fork.
