Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love tapas! Because instead of ordering one entree you get to try and share many small dishes with your party. New Year's Day - they were all well done. My favorites were the baked goat cheese with tomato sauce and toasted garlic bread, the brussle sprouts salad with manchego and toasted almond (omg), the shrimp in garlic, pepper flake and olive oil... It was a great way to spend 3 hours. Good wine selection by the glass.  I don't normally like sangria because it's too sweet, but I tasted everybody's red and it was deelish!  Our server Matt was phenomenal and I can't wait to go back again soon!
