Smoque BBQ////chopped brisket - Smoky, but not excessively so (I had a bad experience elsewhere where everything just tasted like smoke and was awful).  It's flavorful and very moist.  The portion is quite generous.  They give you a cup of sauce on the side, which I think needs work, as it's entirely sweet with no savory or smoky element.
