Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We weren't terribly hungry when we decided to stop in, so we decided to split a small serving of seafood paella as our main. Small is right. We asked the waiter if it would be enough for two along with the pinxtos and he assured us it would be, and that the larger portion is a ton of food for two people. While at may be true, the small portion is not enough for two ( we hadn't mentioned to him that we weren't hungry). Now, that said, I am not one of these people who expect TGI Fridays size platters of food. Quite the opposite. But honestly, this would have been barely enough for one person if there'd hadn't been the tapas first and some bread on the table if the person was hungry for dinner. Portion Â size aside, the paella was only ok. I'd say it was a bit greasy and definitely didn't have a lot of seafood in it. Also could be considered a bit bland, mostly a strong tomato flavor with garlic in the background, though it did come with some sort of basil aioli that I didn't care for and have never seen served with a paella; perhaps this helped the flavor? But again, added grease.
