Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The restaurant has a great ambiance that still feels intimate despite the size of the space. Our server was extremely attentive, friendly, and provided great recommendations re: food and drink. He also mentioned that everything comes out as it's prepared, so that he would stagger our order to give us some breathing room between dishes.
