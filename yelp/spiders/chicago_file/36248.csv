Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////YES! I've been to Bavette's several times. I usually sit downstairs. It has a speakeasy sort of feel, which I love! The servers are fabulous and engaging. Drinks come very quickly which I absolutely love!  Now the food...Delicious.  I don't think I've ever eaten anything here that I didn't simply melt into the leather booth after inhaling! You can't go wrong with Bavette's honestly one of my favorite places to eat in Chicago. I always leave satisfied! Great place for a date!
