Little Goat Diner////Favorite restaurant in Chicago!! I have loved every single thing I have ordered at Little Goat. I love starting my meal with the crab dip with ritz crackers to dip in! Another favorite is the Pork Belly Pancake. Â  Great cocktails too. The atmosphere is great and I've always had phenomenal service.
