Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My bf and I decided on a medium (6 slices, which is equivalent to a small at Giordano's). We did half of the Chicago classic and half of the Lou's special. The waiter warned us that the wait would be about 35 minutes for the pie to be ready, but I'm sure it took almost close to an hour. The tomato sauce here is a little more wet and the crust is definitely not as thick.
