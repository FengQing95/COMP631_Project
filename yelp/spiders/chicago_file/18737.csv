Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It's deep dish, it's buttery and it's delicious.  Lou Malnati's is my favorite for deep dish because of the buttery thin crust and the cheese.  I am not by any means a thin crust person I actually don't prefer it.  But here it is very good.  I recommend you try it at least once
