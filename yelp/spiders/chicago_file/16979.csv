Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm sorry--I hate to be a traitor to my city but I'm probably one of the few people in Chicago that hates deep dish pizza and stuffed pizza.  I'm a pizza purist. I've seen how these folks make pizza crust.It sickens me how they've taken a classic Italian food and bastardized it to fit American taste. No Italian would put butter in their pizza dough EVER!! Pizza should be simple---dough, sauce, cheese and choice of toppings baked in a brick hole in the wall. The crust should be thin because if I wanted to eat bread, I'd go to a bakery. If you have to have a Chicago style pizza, I'd suggest Connie's, the original Nancy's in Elmhurst or Giordano's. Otherwise, if you want to eat REAL pizza then go to Vito and Nicks on the south side  or Nonnie's in the burbs. Chaio!
