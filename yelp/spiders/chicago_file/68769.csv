Little Goat Diner////We showed up at 8am to a mostly empty diner. Our service was good and casual and the waitress was great at providing some suggestions and accommodating requests. I had my typical sweet vs. savory debate but decided to go for the pancakes when informed that all of the offerings used a sourdough base and were absolutely delicious. Laura S. kept it easy with the simple goat served with a biscuit (which looked great). The blueberry pancakes were fantastic, the sourdough pancakes were light and fluffy with none of that carb comma that can come after some pancake breakfasts. I absolutely loved the cream cheese butter (the spreads Izard puts out are always bomb!) and the oatmeal crumble topping. I'd love to come back for lunch or dinner and check out some of the sandwich and entree choices but I'll have to say with breakfast offered all day if you're looking for some pancakes for dinner Little Goat might be the place to come!
