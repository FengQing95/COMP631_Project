Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Another thing we had on the side was the Malnati salad...but there's not much to say. Who care's about salad when you have amazing pizza to drool over? Anyway, the salad came with several toppings--we could hardly eat any after being so stuffed with the pizza (you read that right....... we went for the pizza first)
