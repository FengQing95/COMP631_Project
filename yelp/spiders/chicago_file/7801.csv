Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute of Chicago is a world class museum with an impressive collection, and it is easily one of the crowning gems of the city.  If you have never visited the Art Institute, then you are missing out on a chance to experience some truly magnificent works of art.  If you have visited in the past, then it never hurts to take another look, as the institute's collection is large enough that only a portion of it is ever on display at one time, so there is always something you may have missed.  I am always finding new wonders within these halls and try to make it out for the various special exhibits whenever possible.
