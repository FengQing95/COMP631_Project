Little Goat Diner////There is much to like about this place.  First and foremost, the food is quite good.  The bar area makes a terrific waiting area and they got a great bloody marry.  But, I can't give them a five.  This place serves inventive and well crafted foods based on a diner theme.  That makes it a bit hard to swallow though...  Man I just paid how much for an eggs bennie like thing?  But yeah man that eggs bennie korean thing is crazy good!  Korean peoples, raise your forks and dig in you're going to love it.
