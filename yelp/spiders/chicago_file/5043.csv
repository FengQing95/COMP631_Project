The Purple Pig////Dumbest wine menu you'll ever come across!  Don't believe me?  Take a shot at trying to figure it out, and get back to me!  Immediately upon questioning the waitress how it was organized, she immediately asked my name, and asked that I hold on, as she wanted me to speak to the guy who put it together.  That there tells you that I'm not alone/there is an issue.  The guy was an arrogant @#$hole BTW.
