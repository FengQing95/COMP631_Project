Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Loved it! - the caesar salad, filet mignon and wiskey gelato were delicious and very satisfying.  I also had one of the best Sazeracs ever.  Service was great, prompt, friendly and even provided suggestions for the chef's other places.  My only issue, which was a relatively minor one -- my steak was more medium than rare.  Definitely will come back when I am in this wonderful town again.
