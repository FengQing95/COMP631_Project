Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday about a month ago. The atmosphere/decor was my favorite thing about this place. Old-fashioned and beautiful. Steaks were great but the garlic aoli fries were my favorite part actually. The reason this is not 5 starts is because our waiter was sarcastic and extremely rude. I would still come here and just hope that you get a different waiter. It really put a damper on a day that would have otherwise been pretty perfect.
