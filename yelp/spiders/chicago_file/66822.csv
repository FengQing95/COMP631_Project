Little Goat Diner////Next up the ooey gooey cinnabun (mostly ordered it because the menu states you gotta get there early and apparently I was there early enough that getting one wasn't an issue, I'm guessing they have a limited number of these each day...) when it arrived I almost panicked because it was huge and I was alone but it turned out to be surprisingly light for a cinnamon bun. Th icing had a nice tang to it (goat's milk again? Hmm...) and the center of the bun had a nice big cinnamon surprise.
