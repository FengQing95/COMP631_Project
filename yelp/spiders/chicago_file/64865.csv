Smoque BBQ////Really great BBQ joint, makes you almost forget you're in Chicago. Tried a full run of their offerings from pulled pork, to brisket, to ribs, to chicken. And ordered straight down the line for sides. EVERYTHING was considered, differentiated in flavor, and on point. Will be back very soon.
