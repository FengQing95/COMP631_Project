Art Institute of Chicago////Conveniently located at the end of Millenium Park, I wandered into the Art Institute of Chicago and used my Chicago CityPass for expedited entry. Love it. Though there were various school / class groups in the museum on the morning I visited (Thursday, May 3rd... I think?), the museum is large enough that it wasn't a huge disturbance (unless they were yelling or running around one of the halls - but that was minimal).
