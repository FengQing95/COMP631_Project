Art Institute of Chicago////Side note to the woman complaining about the beeping alarm noises (who also cancelled her membership because of it ...eye roll). Yes, it can be annoying, for both visitors and staff alike, but I worked there years ago and cannot tell you how many children AND ADULTS touch the art!! Security guards can't keep an eye on everyone and every piece of art, so yes, it is completely necessary.
