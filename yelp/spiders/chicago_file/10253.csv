Art Institute of Chicago////I started out when it opened at 10:30am and stayed until 5pm! There was so much to see. I started downstairs with the glass paperweights and the miniatures. I loved the meticulous detail of the miniatures. It doesn't take too long to look at the paperweights and read how they are made. I then made my way to the modern art wing. Don't forget to see Chagall's America Windows. It was beautiful. Being half Greek and married to an Italian, I had to see the the Greek, Roman, & Byzantine Art. On the 2nd level I visited the European art, Impressionism, & Contemporary Art. I took a quick break for lunch around 2:00 and to rest a bit. It was a wonderful day. And while I tried to see everything, it was difficult. I got more than my money's worth. I recommend using the audio to enrich your experience.
