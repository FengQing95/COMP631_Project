Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were in town and had to get our Chicago deep dish fix.  After asking around town, we decided on Lou Malnati's.  I really don't get what all the hype is about.  The ingredients were not quality, the cheese was mushy and not stretchy, the crust was flaky like pie crust, the whole thing was unimpressive and not good at all. I had one slice and didn't finish it.  We ordered mozzerella sticks and those were frozen, not even homemade.  Not sure what the fuss is all about but the best thing I had was my drink.
