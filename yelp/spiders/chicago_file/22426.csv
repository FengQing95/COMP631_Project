Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The Malnati Chicago Classic is the best pizza in Chicago. I would love to debate you in the comment section if there was one. Pro tip. Ask for extra parm packets. It's good cheese, not that fake stuff and if you don't use it will be great on a salad or bowl of pasta next week.
