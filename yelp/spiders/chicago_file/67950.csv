Little Goat Diner////We thought our dinner was hit or miss, but we will likely give it another try. We started with the daily bread, which was absolutely delicious. We also got the fried pickles and onion rings, which we were very excited about but they ended up being almost inedible. The pickles were ok but the onion rings were too huge to eat comfortably and some were not cooked enough--I found flour in a couple after the fried part peeled away. I got the bullseye french toast but without the egg--it wasn't great but I blame my choice to remove the egg. My husband's fun and crispy chicken sandwich was pretty good and the smoked fries were amazing.
