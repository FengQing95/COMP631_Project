Little Goat Diner////I really, really wanted to like this place and even went back a second time to give it a chance. But man, for the caliber of food they serve, the waitstaff needs some serious training. I was a server and busgirl for 5 years and these guys weren't even meeting the bare minimum expectations of what a server should be in a reputable place. I understand it's a casual "diner" and not a 5 star restaurant, but they really have to retrain their staff if they want to keep repeat customers coming. What a shame. The 2 stars are SOLELY for the food and nothing else.
