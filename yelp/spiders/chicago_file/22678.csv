Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Their website says that they are open until 1 am. Naturally my boyfriend and I headed there at 11:50. Upon arrival, one  of the bus boys opened the door for us. We stood there for a few minutes before I decide to walk to the front desk. There was someone behind the counter but there was also someone in front of the counter (looked like a manager) she asked if we planned on dining in. I told her yes and she said "well we're close". I followed up by informing her the website said it doesn't close until 1. She said "yeah I'm sorry it should be updated."
