Little Goat Diner////The second time, I had the patty melt with a side of mac and cheese. I'm not usually a huge fan of restaurant mac and cheese, but had noticed the diner next to me at the counter order it the day before, and it looked so good, I had to order it. Absolutely amazing. The patty melt was also fantastic. If I lived in Chicago, I'd be a regular at this place.
