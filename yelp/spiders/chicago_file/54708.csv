Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Best deviled eggs ever.. ever. Short rib dish and the patatas bravas are also excellent. Don't sleep on the scallops either- yum!! And also the beef empanada was so delicious. Very happy with our meal choices. We went once before and got bacon wrapped dates per everyone's suggestion-- not great in my opinion. The paella the first time we went also didn't blow me out of the water.
