Smoque BBQ////The service was minimal (you wait in line to order and then pick it up when your number is called), but the staff was incredibly friendly. Prices are a tad on the expensive side and it can get pretty busy in the late afternoon and evening, so try to eat here early if you can. Unless you hate the concept of BBQ, you won't be disappointed.
