Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I loved this place!  It was a little bit loud but our party of 6 still managed to carry on conversation.  I recommend reservations since we had them and still waited at the bar for a bit.  No complaints though because the sangria (both the traditional red and the black raspberry) were AWESOME.  All of our tapas were great and the service was fantastic.  The paella was surprisingly very DELICIOUS, the beef brocheta was very tender, the soup of the day was one of the best soups I have ever eaten, and the other tapas were great as well.    So I guess my only drawback is the noise level and crowdedness.  If you don't care about those things and enjoy tapas you will surely love this place.
