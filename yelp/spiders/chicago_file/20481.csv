Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Fast forward to my first trip to Chicago when I decided to expand my horizons and walked into Lou Malnati's, clearly with a huge chip on my shoulder. While ordering, we were told that it would take 30 minutes for our pizza to arrive. 30 friggin' minutes? I could watch a sitcom in that time. I smiled on the inside because I knew my opinions were once again about to be confirmed.
