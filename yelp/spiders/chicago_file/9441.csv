Art Institute of Chicago////After we finished the Modern European section we visited the Chagall "America Windows" exhibit on the first floor. It is tucked away in the back (or at least that's how it felt!) and it's truly amazing. The stained glass was huge & incredible and we enhanced the experience by walking through the the artists' construction & restoration processes on a Mac computer w/pre-programmed choices available - just opposite the America Windows on the left. There were 2 Macs available, but only 1 worked (the other was stuck in screensaver), so I can see how that could get crazy during busy hours. We spent 30 minutes on the America Windows exhibit.
