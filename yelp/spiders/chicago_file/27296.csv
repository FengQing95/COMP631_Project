Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////By far very overrated pizza. If Chicago is known for deep dish I highly recommend not going to this place. I had to tell the waiter this pizza was awful. Never try the lou pizza disgusting. The deep dish pizza wasn't even better. This place ruined my experience in Chicago I rather eat a deep dish pizza at Dominos.
