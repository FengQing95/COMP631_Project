Art Institute of Chicago////My son's favorite part of the museum is the medieval and renaissance period with armors and swords during the 1600 and 1700 century. I have a love for modern art and photography. And my husband enjoys interesting sculptures. I can't help but notice other people admiring and making comments as they walk around. Some look perplexed, some amused and some look like they totally get what the artist is trying to say. Take your time and explore this museum room by room and you're bound to learn something amazing.
