Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Finishing our bruschetta it was another 20 minutes before the young lady arrived to tell us our pizza would be out soon.  Interestingly, my mother began sorting plates from the center of the table at this time and noted one to be quite dirty.  Showing this to the server the server stated "hmm, well, all our plates are in the washer now but I'll see if I can find one."  With nearly twenty Lou's operating in Illinois, I'd like to think their flagship would have a bit more tableware - or that someone in the place could hand wash a dish.
