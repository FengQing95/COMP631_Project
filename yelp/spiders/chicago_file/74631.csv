Little Goat Diner////Every time I'm a first-timer at a restaurant, I've got to choose the one exotic item off the menu. This time, I went with the crumpets with chorizo bathed in maple syrup garnished with bite-sized tomatoes. While 3 miniscule crumpets may look like it may not fill you, rest assured, it was the perfect portion without feeling overly full. My companion went all out with the goat almighty burger stacked a skewer's length high with braised beef, bbq pork, and some sweet fixin's. He was only able to finish 1/2 of that monster, and I chowed down the other 1/2. Goat patties are a little different...more chewy and lean texture-wise. Now, what would've been nice is the option to add an a la carte item to your meal at a reduction. $6 for smoked fries, which were addictively good and non-greasy.
