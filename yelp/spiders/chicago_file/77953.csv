Little Goat Diner////The Korean burger was monstrous and a sight to behold (great presentation). It was difficult and messy to eat because of how big the burger was. All of the ingredients were piled on high. I thought the beef patty was delicious and generally, this was a fine burger. Smoky, savory, and satisfying.
