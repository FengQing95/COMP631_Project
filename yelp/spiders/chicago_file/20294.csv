Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Final note: While you wait, you can put in your order for pizza. They will cook it most of the way and then finish it off when you are seated and ready to feast. This is a good gig because deep dish can take upwards of 45 mins to cook, so it double duties the waiting time for the food by ordering before you're seated.
