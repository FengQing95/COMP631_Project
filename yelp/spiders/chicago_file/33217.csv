Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Service: As I mentioned before, the waiters seemed a bit strained at times, but I didn't mind this as it created a relaxed and un-rushed dinner which can be hard to come by. He checked in on us when our food arrived (which came out promptly upon ordering) and the support staff was spot on. The hostesses were also very friendly--I can't find any complaints across the board.
