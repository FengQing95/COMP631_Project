Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Much better than the one in Schaumburg!!! We came with a large group on a Sunday and we only had to wait 20 minutes! The coffee was good and strong and the orange juice and nice and sweet. Our group had some extremely picky members and they were more than accommodating to us! The eggs benedict was flawless and traditional. Even better, it came with a side of fruit at no extra cost! I hate when such a heavy main dish is served with heavier sides! This place also has a great location right off of Millennium Park! There are plenty of options on here for picky eaters as well or if everyone just wants something a little different. The service was great and the prices were bad either!
