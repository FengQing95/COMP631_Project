Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////WE LIVE IN CHICAGO!! Why people like this place is beyond me.I have been to the Oak Park location.It feels like processed food and not really great Italian.For the price,I prefer Mancini's across the street or Freddy's in Cicero.Lou's is for atmosphere,not great food.Anytime something turns into a chain it loses the authenticity of the original intention.
