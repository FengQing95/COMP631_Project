Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came on friend's recommendation. Was told to give a number and wait to be texted in 15ish minutes and was texted in two and seated almost immediately which was wonderful. Hostess was very kind. The classic red sangria was great! Definitely would've returned for that. Bread was mediocre and they gave cold olive oil to dip. Could've been better but hey, it's free so can't complain. Waiter was nice, explained everything and checked on us just enough times. My friends and I shared a paella de mariscos and thats where I was underwhelmed. Portion was great, but the server didn't leave the pan on the table for us, he scooped it all out onto separate plates and just gave us that...? Aesthetically looked like mush, and the pan usually keeps the food warm until we finish. At least that's what all the other restaurants I've ever gotten paella at does. I was a little confused. Also I'm not positive on how paella is supposed to be cooked but this one was much greasier than others I have had. And without the pan to keep it warm it became increasingly...hard to swallow lets say. But the tapas were great, ambience was great. I've only been here once so I wouldn't mind coming back to try other things!
