Little Goat Diner////We were lucky to get a table right away at this busy spot. The Spaghetti breakfast item features clams so it was surprise that after we'd put our order in and had been waiting a while when an employee (not our waitstaff) announced that they had run out of clams. I kept the order and think they compensated with added crab. It was okay. Might have been better with the clams. Wife had the Scallop Tostada. "It was good."
