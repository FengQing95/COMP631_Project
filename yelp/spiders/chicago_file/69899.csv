Little Goat Diner////The Girl & The Goat is my FAVORITE! If I ever go back to Chicago, I am eating there again. As a result of going there, we decided to also visit Little Goat. Since we were celebrating two birthdays, we ordered lots of drinks and the Los Drowned, Sloppy Goat, and Garlic Mashed potatoes. The food was good, but maybe since we had dinner at The Girl & The Goat the night before, it just wasn't mind-blowing. I do remember the service was excellent. Our waiter was really friendly, attentive (just the right amount) and brought out a shot and small dessert for our two birthday boys. If looking for a more casual atmosphere but still high quality food, this is the place to go.
