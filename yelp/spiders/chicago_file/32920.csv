Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is easily one of the best steakhouses in Chicago (also check out Benny's and Kinzie's). The last time I was here I got the Bone-in dry aged rib-eye and my wife got the petite fillet, both were perfect. The sides here are also amazing, we got the mushrooms, creamed spinach (!!!!) and elote style corn, all of them were great. This place is definitely on the pricey side but definitely recommended for a nice occasion.
