Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Hate to admit it but I'm only an hour or two from Chicago and I had never deep dish pizza.  Now that I tried Lou Malnati's I'm pretty much ruined for any other kind of deep dish pizza.  It's so good!  The wait is long but it's worth it.  With a bunch of locations in the Chicago area you can't be far from one.  Go get your deep dish on!
