Little Goat Diner////my man isn't quite the foodie i am (yet) - so this was the perfect place for us.  foodie brain power in casual environment.  pretty much the yummiest diner i've ever been to in my entire life.  we shared a delcious chocolate malt milkshake - he got a burger... i got a GOAT burger with kimchi on it.  just great.
