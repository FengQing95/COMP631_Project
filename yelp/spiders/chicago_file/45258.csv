Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I had made a reservation for the only feasible time on Saturday, 9:00 pm.  A little late for one used to waking up at 5 am and sleeping at 9:30, but I thought I'd chance it.  We arrived a few minutes late and were told it would be a few minutes which was fine.  Even by 9 the place was swarming with Lincoln Parkians and their parents, visiting from out of town - raucous bachlelorette parties decked out in penis swag - couples on intimate dates eschewing romantic whisperings for loud conversation just to hear each other.
