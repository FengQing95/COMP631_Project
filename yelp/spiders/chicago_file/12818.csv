Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Overall, i prefer Lou pizza to the competition (matter of opinion).  As for this place specifically, it is very popular being in the city and as such, usually packed. With that said, the service is very good. If you can, grab a spot at the bar, order an appetizer and drink and youre good to go on your wait.  Otherwise, itll be standing either outside in the "grazing area" or inside.
