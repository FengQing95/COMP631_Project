Little Goat Diner////I had the pork belly pancake.  The pancake is asian influenced, so it was savory and had scallions in it which added another layer of flavor.  The dish itself almost looked like an over sized taco.  The pork belly was amazing and honestly one of the best things I ate in Chicago.  However, the portion of pork belly available was small and for an entree that featured pork belly, I would expect it to be more present on the dish.
