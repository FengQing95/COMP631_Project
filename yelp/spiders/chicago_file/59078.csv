Smoque BBQ////I suppose I fancy myself a BBQ connoisseur. Having grown up in the Chicago area, I have a fondness and affinity for that sticky-sweet-tomatoey-Carson's-type of sauce (not that I would complain about L. Woods either). However, having lived in the deep south for many years, I also appreciate that pit-wet-and-dry-smokey-vinegary thing as well. So I was very excited when a new BBQ place had opened in the neighborhood.
