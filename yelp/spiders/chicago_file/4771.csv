The Purple Pig////Purple Pig sits at a whopping 5000+ reviews, so mine will most definitely be lost. Regardless, I am here to say that Purple Pig is quite a delicious restaurant/bar. Even upon opening, lines can get quite long; so unless you're a party of 2, do expect to wait. There're outdoor seating, bar seating and regular tables to suit all the types of diners.
