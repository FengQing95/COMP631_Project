Little Goat Diner////My family of 4 dined at Little Goat while we waited for the next train to leave Union Station. We were not starving and didnt feel like spending a lot for a quick bite. So we said lets try a Diner Little Goat. Wow our bill was $126 for 3 sandwiches. Nacho's and a waffle, sides of brussels sprouts and 2 milk shakes--only think good was the waffle and nacho's that were excellent-service was very good.
