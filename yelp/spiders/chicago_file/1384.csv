Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I had the fig omlet with fruit and coffee, my boyfriend had bacon and a chorizo omlet. The atmosphere is plesant its a tad crowded but we were sat quickly about an hour before closing on a friday morning, and the coffee was hot fresh and good! The portions are big! Overall delicious! They got the order right to a T even with the tweaks i added no issues
