Little Goat Diner////We started off with the Hot Crab Dip.  It was super cheesy and there was a lot of crab in the dip.  I was very impressed with the dip. My only complaint is that it was served with Ritz crackers (and not enough) - I think toasted bread or even a different chip would have held up better.
