Little Goat Diner////We shared a whole bunch of things, so rather than give you an exhaustive list, I will juts note that 73% of them included pork, and all of them made us make very adult noises. We all particularly liked the pork cheek, which was a special that day. The PB&J pie (dessert), another item that could have easily been one-note, was fantastic.
