Smoque BBQ////We stopped in on a Friday afternoon and walked right up to the counter, ordered from a very friendly young man and grabbed a table after filling our cups with some sweet tea (which is a must with southern barbeque). Shortly thereafter our number was called and we dug in. We sampled a bit of everything with the exception of the peach cobbler, ribs and chicken.
