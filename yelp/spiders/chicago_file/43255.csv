Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////So, if you like tapas or are looking for a nice introduction to them, Ba-Ba-Reeba gets my recommendation. The place is trendy, a bit crowded, and can be romantic if you want it to be ;) I won't make any specific menu recommendations because there is soooo much that is sooo good - just be a little bold and adventurous!
