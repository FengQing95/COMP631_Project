Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////For some reason, after shoving everything down our throats as quickly as possible, our waiter decided to wait 30 minutes before asking us if we wanted to dessert.  Seriously.  What did he do during this time?  Stand next to our table.  Where his friends were seated.  And gossip to them about his relationship problems.  Wow.
