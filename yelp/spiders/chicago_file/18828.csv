Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Long wait! It was crazy in there on a Saturday night. We expected it though. The bad thing about it was that it's so small and cramped that it's just a blob of people with nowhere to sit, even the bar seats were at a premium. We stayed pressed against the wall for 45 minutes watching people push by. Not very comfortable! We got seated in an area that was on the other side of the bar, so it was really hard to get to it through the mass of people. I think this affected our service. Our waiter was definitely working a lot and it must have sucked to have to shove through people to get to tables. Less visits to our tables. There was a bus boy who came to get our plates but he never noticed our empty glasses on the edge of the table. We had to ask a few times for this and for forks for our salad.
