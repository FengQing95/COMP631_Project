Art Institute of Chicago////My oldest daughter who was 8 at this time loves art and wants to be an artist so we had to stop here. This place is HUGE. I'm not sure we got to even see everything but it was fun trying to. Lots of classic paintings here with the most recognizable one being American Gothic. A must for any art lover visiting Chicago.
