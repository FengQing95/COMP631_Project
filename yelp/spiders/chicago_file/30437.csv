Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The location was very busy at 6:30 on a Wednesday night. Fortunately you can place your order while you wait for the table, as it takes 30-45 minutes to make the pizza. Also, there's a full bar to make the wait time pass quickly. They use text messaging to let you know when the table is ready.
