Art Institute of Chicago////My wife is an artist who has her work in several galleries so this was a particular interesting time for her. Although visited many times you never tire of looking at the greatest works of art in world. We spent over four hours viewing; Vincent van Gogh Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Claude Monet, The Great Wave by Hokusai and several others. To see everything it would take days. My suggestion is to pick several periods or artists and focus on them during one visit. The people there are very helpful so as you navigate thru the museum maze someone is always available to point you in the right direction.
