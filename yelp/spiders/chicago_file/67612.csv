Little Goat Diner////Was in Chicago visiting and so excited to be able to make it to Little Goat on a Monday for lunch, when the crowd was lighter. I made a reservation for my boyfriend and I and I'm so glad I did because even on a Monday afternoon this place filled up quickly.  We split the Sloppy Goat (our favorite of all the items we tried), the Goat Chili, Chickpea Salad with chicken, and fries.  Reason for the 4 rating was only because though I liked the salad it was a bit greasy from the falafel, and the goat chili, while unique, wasn't our favorite.  It was a cool atmosphere and was fun finally checking out a Stephanie Izard restaurant.
