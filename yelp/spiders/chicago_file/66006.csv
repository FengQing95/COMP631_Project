Smoque BBQ////BEST bbq in Chicago! Nothing comes close to it and what I love most about this place is that you get the whole package - brisket, fries, mac and cheese, corn bread, variety of sauces and peppers, dessert. Each and every item is worth ordering. Could eat this weekly - too bad they aren't closer to me!
