Little Goat Diner////In the end the food saved the day and made it worth the visit. The bulls-eye french toast is an example of the creativity here, and I highly recommend it. In the future, an execution of common sense on the part of the hostesses could avoid frustration from customers and add to their overall experience. I felt like the waiter's level of service did not meet the high dollar tip he receives as a result of the prices here. Even at 18% he still makes off with a robbery, but I felt bad leaving less. As I said in my previous review, the food is good but the high prices prevent me from coming here as much as I would like.
