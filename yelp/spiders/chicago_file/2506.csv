The Purple Pig////Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs- I LOVE BONE MARROW and this was fantastic! There was three of us and they gave us two large sliced bone marrow- plenty to go around. It comes with this toasted flavorful bread (you can ask for more). Get a slice of the bread, smear some bone marrow, sprinkle some of the parsley, and add a pinch of salt. HEAVENLY!!!!!!!
