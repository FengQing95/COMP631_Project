Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went here for dinner on Saturday 10/18 with my sisters, one who is vegan and the other who is vegetarian. We had the seasonal apple cider sangria, which was amazing. We were told that it's smart to order 3-4 tapas per person, but we wanted to get the farmer's market paella (2 servings) to share, so we ordered 4 tapas total & the paella. it was a little too much food, but everything was delicious. We got the stuffed mushrooms, bread with tomato, garlic & arugula & roasted vegetables- my favorite was the stuffed mushrooms. I also got the mini-tapa stuffed date w/chorizo- delicious. could have eaten 10 of them. Will definitely be back to try some of the meat dishes!
