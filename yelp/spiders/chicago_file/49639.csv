Smoque BBQ////This place is great!  I heard about it on the food channel and had to go check it out for myself.  The people working are extremely friendly and the owner was even walking around making sure everyone was doing good.  I like the fact that they seat you, so you're not fighting for a table because the place is on the small side.  It's definitely not a place to chill and hang out, you pretty much order, sit, eat and done, but it's so worth it!  I had the half of a pulled pork sandwich (perfect size if you don't have a huge appetite), a bag of fries (fresh cut - huge portion and great seasoning), and the cornbread (substituted instead of coleslaw - also cooked to perfection).  I was with several other people who had the brisket, ribs and chicken, and there were no complaints.
