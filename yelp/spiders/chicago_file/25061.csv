Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've never had deep dish pizza-and I've been told Lou Malnati's was the place I had to try in Chicago. And it for sure didn't disappoint. I'd recommend getting the buttercrust for the pizza-it adds a better taste. Also, if you sign up for emails through their free wifi, you can get a free appetizer with a purchase of $20!
