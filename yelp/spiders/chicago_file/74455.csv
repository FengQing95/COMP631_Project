Little Goat Diner////My experience could have been better if they didn't seat us at the bar. After waiting for 45 minutes for a table we were seated at the bar which was the most uncomfortable seat of my life. Stools and bar table were too short and there was not enough leg room between our bolted seats and the vertical part of the bar table, so we both( I'm 5 7 and my husband is 6 2) had to fold our legs under the bar and basically sit sideways. I didn't enjoy my food at all. Â As far as the food goes, I ordered the " little pig went to China" and that was descent. A bit on the salty side but descent and my husband ordered the pancake. Nothing extraordinary about his pancakes. Overall a very disappointing experience. Bathrooms were clean though.
