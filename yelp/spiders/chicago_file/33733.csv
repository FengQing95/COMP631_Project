Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Just an incredible dining experience. Highly suggest for a date. The atmosphere is romantic and the music is classic. The food is out of this world. We had the bone in filet which was outstanding and gives Chicago Cut a run for it's money. We also enjoyed the white fish caesar salad which is light and has a surprising flavor for a caesar (in a good way). Our sides for the steak were the mashed potatoes which were delicious and the creamed spinach with blue cheese and caramelized onions (a little salty but pretty good). To finalize our outstanding dinner we had the chocolate cream pie. It's like oreos and chocolate mouse had a baby and that baby is ridiculously delicious. To top it off, the service was outstanding, both at the bar and at our table. Bavette's provides a perfect evening with great service, a wonderful atmosphere with a classic chicago feel and a unique and playful menu.
