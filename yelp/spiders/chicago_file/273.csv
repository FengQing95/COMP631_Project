Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I really wish that yelp allowed us to give 1/2 stars, because I would give Wildberry 3 1/2 stars, but I'll stick with 3 for this review. The wait wasn't too bad - only a 35 minute wait for a party of 4 on a Sunday. Go anywhere else in the loop area at this day/time, and you are looking at an hour. The pancakes were great - I got the buttermilk pancakes with bananas. Also tasted the pumpkin spice pancakes, which were tasty. Not too sweet, but nice well-rounded use of spices. The bacon was good, but the eggs needed a little more seasoning. One of my friends tried the french toast and said that it wasn't very good. Stay away from the french toast and get the pancakes instead. Nevertheless, this is a good solid brunch place - I'd go back.
