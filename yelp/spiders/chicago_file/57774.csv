Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tasty but standard brunch spot. We started with $10 bloody marys from the bar. While this sounds like a great idea, I realized I have no idea what to put in (horseradish, onion spears, pickles, Tabasco etc available) so it was good but a little weird. The food was okay. We had some hits- the fried chicken bites and some misses- the Cubano. Everything was good and not a bad price, but it's not one of my favorite brunch spots I've been to. It is a lettuce restaurant so you get points for eating there!
