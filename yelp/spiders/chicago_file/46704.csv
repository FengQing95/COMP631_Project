Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////- Great food, tons of vegetarian options. My favorites include: sea food paella, it's fresh and the huge portion is easily sharable by 4-5 people. The market salad is delicious with the textures all playing well together. The spicy potatoes and goat cheese in tomato sauce actually pair well together, who doesn't like high-carb foods? I've also never been disappointed with the chef's specials, so be sure to hear them out.
