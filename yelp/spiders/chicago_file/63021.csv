Smoque BBQ////For almost $20 per person, Smoque was not worth it. It was way over hyped for what it was worth. Maybe they were having an off day or maybe Guy just got it completely wrong, but this was definitely not a place where I had to check out in Chicago. Overall this whole meal could be summed up in one word. Disappointing.
