Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The "classic" pizza was delicious! The "Lou malnati" salad was so good but you'd have to like sweet. The service was ok. Our waiter had to keep going downstairs for our beer, they should have a cooler for bottled beer so it's more convenient. That's a lot for a waiter to keep going up and down. Our pizza came before our salad, apparently ours was given away. Our waiter never noticed until we told the person who delivered our pizza. Thank god we weren't charged for the salad. Overall, love the food'
