Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The choice of tapas was certainly impressive, the service not so much. There was much mushroom to choose from, none made an impact. My top 2 picks - the goatcheese/tomato sauce, and the chocolate tres leches. The salads were a trifle insipid, and the sangrias somewhat weak, but here maybe what we singled out from the selection was a bit to blame.
