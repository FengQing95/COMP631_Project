Little Goat Diner////Awesome vegan menu. It's not a ton of options, but everything is tasty. The avocado toast is always good. The ingredients change seasonally. We always get it. The pasta and scallion pancakes change with the season, too. The vegan home fries are AMAZING. They are probably the best part. Also, the vegan chocolate shake is quite good.
