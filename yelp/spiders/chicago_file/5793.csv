The Purple Pig////I came here for dinner after a show during peak dinner hours and the wait was actually a lot shorter than I expected. I left my name and walked around and I got a notification about 15mins that my table was ready. The atmosphere is casual and loud. The seating was a bit tight and my table was very close to the tables beside me.
