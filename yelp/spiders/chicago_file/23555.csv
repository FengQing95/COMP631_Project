Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We arrived for an early lunch at 11:30 and were seated immediately but it was 15 minutes before a waitress came over and acknowledged us. Thus, I had a bad impression early on. We decided to get a small "the Lou" pizza to split between two people. This is a veggie pizza with spinach, mushrooms, and tomatoes. Since we knew the pizzas took a while, we wanted an app and decided to go with the stuffed spinach bread. This bread was amazing and was the highlight of our meal...super cheesy and delicious. However, we were disappointed with the pizza. The crust was bland and definitely not buttery considering that they call it their "buttercrust", and the cheese and toppings were just alright. Nothing to write home about.
