Art Institute of Chicago////Free February by Comed brought me to the door.  The awesome collection was uplifting and made me feel better about the world.  Isn't that what art is supposed to do?  I enjoyed the modern wing the most.  The early American furniture, sculptures, and paintings really moved me.  It must have been growing up with parents who worshiped antiques.  It must have rubbed off on me as I truly appreciated this part of the museum.
