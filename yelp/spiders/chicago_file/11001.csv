Art Institute of Chicago////I hadn't been since I was a kid and I was really blown away. It really is fantastic and I can see why it was awarded the Top Museum in the World according to Trip Advisor. They have some of the world's most famous paintings. The paintings and the artwork have been kept in amazing shape.
