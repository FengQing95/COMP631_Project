Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place was just a short walk from our hotel and all the locals recommended this spot. I wasn't about to leave Chicago without getting my fair share of deep dish pizza! My family and I came here on a Monday night and this place had a line surrounding the door. Â It's a bit different than what I'm used to. Here you order before you're actually at your table. Order while you wait and then once you get seated your food will be ready. Well, at least this is the idea.
