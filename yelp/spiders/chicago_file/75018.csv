Little Goat Diner////A friend and I visited this Diner after a morning at the Shedd Aquarium with our two toddlers. We really appreciated the cookies and coffee from the adjoining cafe while we waited for our table to be ready. After a long morning, we were all tired and very hungry! Oatmeal raisin cookie for the win... SO good.
