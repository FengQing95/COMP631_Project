The Purple Pig////As visitors to Chicago, this place was on our list but we were nervous about the no reservations set up. We decided to try a late afternoon time and were rewarded by a short wait! Our small group was shown to our "assigned seats" at the communal tables and we started to review a menu that everything sounded tasty. With the help of our neighboring diners and the knowledgeable servers, we started our selecting our items.
