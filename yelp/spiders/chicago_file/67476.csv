Little Goat Diner////Not a fan. The foodie take on American classics just does not work for me here. Every time I've been, at least one member of my party has been disappointed with some part of their meal. Either it's too greasy (not in a good diner way) or the favors not blend well. Â Can't put my finger on it but I won't be back.
