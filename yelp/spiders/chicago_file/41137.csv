Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The shrimp and scallop paella was excellent, my favorite of the 5-6 dishes of my visit.   I had some sangria, which was pretty good, but almost seemed a little watered down.  I had the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, and the orange and beet salad.  Both were good enough, I suppose, but nothing that would make me crave them again.  I also had the beef tenderloin and blue cheese.  Despite being assured that the blue cheese was a delicious addition to the beef, it was almost offensive to me to ruin a nice piece of meat with an overflowing hunk of melted cheese.  The meal had a nice ending, though, because of the fantastic bacon-wrapped dates.  I'm still unsure what a date is, but I know that this dish was quite good.  I don't know why the dates were soaked in vinaigrette - not a fan - but it was delicious nonetheless.
