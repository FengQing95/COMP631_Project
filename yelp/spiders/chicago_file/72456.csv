Little Goat Diner////A go-to for out of towners, they get it right most of the time. I love how they embrace children there, and the menu is diverse with asian influence. The waffles are crisp on the outside and gooey inside, the bacon good and coffee better. Definitely get the Blue Plate Special as a table entree.
