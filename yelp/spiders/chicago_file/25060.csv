Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So, check it....I ordered a peperoni large pie, some rolls and a drink. The rolls were tasty and the pizza was really fulling, you will need a fork the eat this pizza but it's full of flavorful sauce and cheese. I wish that they sold a slice of pizza to try 1st but they don't sale slices because it's made in a dish, which means that if you come here alone, you will be having leftovers-unless you are hungry as hell and can eat what is like the equivalent of two regular pizza pies. So, if you are visiting Chi-town, this place should be on your list of places to dine at.
