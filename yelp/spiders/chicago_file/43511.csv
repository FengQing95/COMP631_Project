Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Went here for the first time for a birthday party. This place was decent. I liked my food, and the prices, but it didn't blow me away. We got a few pitchers of Sangria, which were good, but not great. Â I tried the spinach and manchengo stuffed mushrooms, mushroom empanada with porcini alioli, goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, and the garlic potato salad and they were all good.
