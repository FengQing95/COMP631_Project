Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food is absolutely amazing here! From the bone marrow, to the truffle mac n cheese, to the sourdough bread they bring you, to the dry aged steak, you can't go wrong with what you order. However, if you don't order the chocolate cream pie at the end of your meal, you didn't do Bavettes right.
