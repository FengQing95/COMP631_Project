The Purple Pig////For lunch, we ordered the pork neck gravy and ricotta, the pork blade steak, and the roasted cauliflower. I HIGHLY recommend the first two for a great representation of what Purple Pig has to offer. The pork neck gravy tasted like pulled pork and was so rich and creamy with a great tomato base. The pork blade steak was to die for - the glaze on the pork was some rendition of nutty honey and was paired so well with a nduja. The updated 5-star is for these two dishes!
