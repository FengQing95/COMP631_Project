Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My wife and I love this spot and come here for date nights as often as possible. Truly a great atmosphere and staff is always great. We had one instance where we felt sick after eating (we had the exact same dish, and same drinks minus one where she had a glass of wine and I had Bourbon) and the team reached out via email, then followed up with a phone call. Went over all their preventative measures, apologized, and made the situation right. 100% sure it was a one off scenario so no hard feelings. Handled very professionally.
