Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////When we got there, we were quoted a 30 minute wait.  I thought it must have pretty great food to have a wait list.  Happily, we were seated after only 20 minutes.  The dining area wasn't spacious in the sense that the tables were very close to one another.  The waitress came to us in a timely manner, and we placed our order.  The food was brought out within 10 minutes or so, which was decent.  The glazed blueberry crepes had no glaze on them. The blueberries inside had little sauce around them.  There were blueberries on top also, but other than that, the presentation lacked.  There were 3 of them.  The crepes were very plain tasting.  Not much to them.  Wouldn't order them again.  The chocolate chip banana bread French toast (the menu says chocolate banana bread French toast, but it just has choc chips in it) had a nice presentation.  There were 3 slices on the plate, and each slice was approximately 3x4 inches and 1 inch thick.  They were sprinkled with chocolate chips and banana slices.  Looked delicious.  The banana bread used was dry and flavorless.  Wouldn't order this item again.  Our waitress wasn't attentive.  The restaurant was clean.  The restrooms were clean.  I wouldn't return here because each breakfast entrée was around $11.00, and they weren't anything amazing.
