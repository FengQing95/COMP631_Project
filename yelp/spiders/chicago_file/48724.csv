Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tried this place for the 1st time today and it was AMAZING! So sad I have to leave back to California in a week, I had the papas bravas with the paella & chicken kabob and it was delicious !!! The atmosphere is great and our server Marilyn was so sweet! Will definitely be back when I visit again :)
