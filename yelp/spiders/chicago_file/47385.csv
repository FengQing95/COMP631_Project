Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been here several times and have had a great experience every time. True Spanish style tapas with all the dishes I had when I was in Spain recently. The tapas I can't say no to are the: brussel sprouts salad, stuffed mushrooms, chorizo wrapped dates (seriously you MUST order these), goat cheese dip, and olives. The most recent time I had the beef and chicken empanadas and they were good but I could take them or leave them. The calamari is pretty good too. I don't know that you can really go wrong with any of the food though! I usually end up getting a pitcher or 2 of sangria while I'm there which is good but a little sugary for my liking. The ambiance is great, the service is friendly and you will definitely have a great time at this restaurant!!
