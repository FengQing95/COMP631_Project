Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ridiculous wait for sub par food. It has been a few years since I have been here but the wait is not worth it. Â They announce for tables like you are at an Applebees in the burbs. Once seated we had to ask to change seats due to a terrible smokey smell but it turned out all they had to do was shut the flue in the oven. Our waitor was the best part of the night.
