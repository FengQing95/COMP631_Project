Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The star of the show though (if you plan your meal properly and save enough room), is the paella.  My mom was in town last weekend and begged me to take her back to "that amazing paella place."  It takes a while to cook, and they make you order at least two servings, but the servings are huge and I've found that two servings is perfect for four people after having a few small tapas to start with.  I've had the seafood and the chicken paellas and both are phenomenal, just depends on what you're in the mood for!
