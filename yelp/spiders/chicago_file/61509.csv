Smoque BBQ////I literally just finished my meal at smoque, I'm struggling to keep my eyes open as the bus boy takes mine and my girlfriends empty trays away. Â This was my first experience and I could not be more impressed, I'm friends with a lot of very good bbq gurus and this food easily matched them. The sauces were amazing, the sides were amazing, the food was fast and delicious and very fair priced. Wish I lived in Chicago so I could have it more often.
