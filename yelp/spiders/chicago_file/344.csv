Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The place to go if you Have time early mornings excellent food you can't really  go wrong unless you order online they tend to mess that up 85% of the time but call in and talk to someone they are friendly and get your order right everytime thats why they lost 1 star. Oh yea the biscuits are dry and nasty But that's my opinion, I only tried it twice. But anyways their Rutherford omelette is soo good makes you want to scream.  Cranberry pecan pancakes excellent Great quality. But one time I upgraded my meal paid an extra $1.50 for the cranberry pecan pancakes and  they left out the cranberries but you guessed it, it was an online order. Unfortunately when it's an online order yyhey can't refund you the $1.50 because it's a third party I was told by chownow and chownow said they contacted the restaurant  and they cant refund it unless they said it was ok which they said they couldn't however they did replace it i had to walk up there on lunch on a friday and i was starting my diet the next day and was not eating pancakes at 130 but i just gave them away to someokne else and they couldnt stop thanking me. It was printed correctly on the receipt and I double checked the online order it was there but I don't know maybe when the cook gets the order it don't display correctly.  Fried chicken and waffles were good with the jalapenos and candied bacon. It even comes with strips of bacon so it's worth it and I love spicy.  But with that being said you have to try wildberry great food excellent portion sizes
