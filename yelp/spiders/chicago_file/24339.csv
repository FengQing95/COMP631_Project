Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We waited an hour for a small pizza in which we devoured it in less than 15mins, but it was worth the wait even tho we were rushing to John Hancock for our ride at the tilt....I dunno what promotion they had that day on July 5 but we got a small deep dish pizza (chicago style) for only $9 including tax, what a friggin deal!!!!!!!
