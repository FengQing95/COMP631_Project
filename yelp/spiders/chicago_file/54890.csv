Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here with a large group on Sunday night (made reservations on OpenTable beforehand), and I'm glad we made a reservation because this place was poppin. We decided to all get tapas and paella to share, which allowed us to try many different things. I would recommend getting a pitcher of their sangria (we got the classic red, but all of them looked great!).
