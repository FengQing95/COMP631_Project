The Purple Pig////We tried the bone marrow, broccoli, chicken kabobs , and the Sicilian to finish off the meal. Everything we tried was absolutely delicious! The menu is a little pricey and if it were not for that fact, I would have ordered several other items. If you are on a budget then this is probably not the place. If you are traveling and looking for a unique spot then this is defiantly the place. If we are ever back in Chicago we will make every effort to come back.
