Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////First off, best steak frites in Chicago. 8 oz. of sliced, prime ribeye, a side of hot and crispy pomme frites, and two dipping sauces (an aioli and a bernaise sauce). They also bring you this seasoning mix to dip your steak in, a mixture of coarse salt, dried herbs, garlic, and onion. It is unbelievably good, and makes their already-fantastic steak taste even better.
