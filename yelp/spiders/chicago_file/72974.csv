Little Goat Diner////We got here around noon on a Friday for brunch and there was about a 30 minute wait for inside seating (they also had outdoor patio seating).  Instead of waiting, we decided to sit at the "Bread Bar" which is in the back of the restaurant.  The bartenders were super friendly, attentive, and very knowledgeable about the menu.  They helped us navigate the menu and even recommended some their favorite dishes.
