Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered both the mozzarella cheese sticks and a bowl of the minestrone soup. The sticks were pretty standard. Nothing to complain about. But the minestrone soup was out of this world. Easily the best I've ever had by miles. It says on the menu it takes two days to prepare. I can see why. Order this. You won't regret it.
