Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It doesn't matter what you order because it will be fabulous.  I'm boring and just get the steak and frites.  It's a flavorful cut, has a killer crust, and is served to your temp preference. Definitely try a couple sides.  That mac and cheese is sensational.  As is the charred broccoli.
