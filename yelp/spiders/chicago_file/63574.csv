Smoque BBQ////Never have I ever had such a pleasant restaurant experience. Amazing food (my family had a variety of foods and each one was amazing in itself). The service was outstanding for the amount of people ordering. Prices were not too expensive, and well worth quality-wise. The owner was extremely helpful as he also hid away the backpack I had left there and was happy to return it to me even after the restaurant had closed. Would highly recommend visiting this restaurant, does not disappoint!
