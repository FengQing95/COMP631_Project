Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After visiting "The Bean" in Millenium Park we worked up an appetite for some Chicago style pizza.  We thought what better then Lou Malnati's Pizzeria.  Lou's boasts over a 1000 reviews as I add mine, with a solid 4 out of 5 stars.  We arrived about 15 minutes early grabbing a rare parking spot right in front of the iconic red awning.  The staff couldn't have started out any better with this foodie then they did, opening the doors 15 minutes early on a cool spring day on the streets of Chicago.  The staff was super friendly and seemed surprised when I told them I was ready to order before even glancing at the menu.  We started with an order of the Calamari Fritta.  Well seasoned, perfectly fried squid served with extra lemons & a tangy red sauce.  We didn't have to wait as long as you might for some other Chicago style pizzas, because the server was dishing up some pie before you knew it.   The pizza was absolutely amazing.  A thick , buttery crusted pie oozing with cheese ( I mean oozing, the cheese stretched as far as my son could stretch his little 8 year old arms).  But what really made the pie was the layer of their house made sausage.  The sausage was a combination of pork and beef, made in house and was the highlight of this visit if you ask me.  The sauce was very simple, crushed tomatoes with a pinch of salt & sugar.  We really enjoyed our visit & I would have to plan a return visit on road trip passing through Chicago for sure.  We had some pizza left over and I don't think it made it half way to St. Louis.  It smelled the car up something good, and if you would have been in the car you would have seen a little drool drip down the corner of my lip when the carry out container was cracked open.  I have eaten at several Chicago Pizzeria's & I would have to say Lou's is high up on my list.  A must try if in Chicago!!
