Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Spanish tapas & sangria? Count me in. It was our first time here and I'm sure there will be plenty more visits in the future. Don't forget to make reservations ahead of time, especially if dining on the weekends. We were lucky enough to get last minute reservations on a Friday night. The place was already packed even before 6 p.m.
