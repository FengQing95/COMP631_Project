Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Wow, all I can say is wow.. wow, wow, wow. Every time I eat here I'm blown away. Service is super friendly and FAST. If you time your orders properly you could have a never ending flow of tapas, and I ain't mad at that. Bacon wrapped dates are one of my favorites and some of the best I've ever had. I could honestly eat one of everything on the menu, Â beer selection could be better but their cocktails make up for that, their mezcal mule is A-1. Make a reservation to avoid waiting since it's usually pretty busy, it's a massive space but tables fill up fast.
