Art Institute of Chicago////When I heard that not only had The Art Institute opened a new Modern Wing, but that that it was free to all opening week I invited my mom to come with me and check it out. One of my favorite things about modern art is how a singular piece can evoke such different reactions in people; where I found a piece liberating and contemplative, my mom found it dark, cruel and depressing.
