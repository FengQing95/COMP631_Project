Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Then I opted for a basic pepperoni deep dish pizza for one. It was kind of fantastic. Crispy on the outside and not at all soggy like other deep dish pizzas. Overall I'd come back next time I'm on Chicago so grab a beer and some pizza and maybe a salad and enjoy. These guys know what they are doing.
