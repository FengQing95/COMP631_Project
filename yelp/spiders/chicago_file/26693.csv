Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////From the cheese pulls to the thick sausage and the rich sauce, the Classic was definitely my favorite of the two. Our server, Jessie, was jess-t amazing, and made sure we had everything we needed. I'm pretty easy to please with food, but that was 5/5 for sure - some of, if not the best, pizza I've ever had!
