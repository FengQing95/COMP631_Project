Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Food was good but not worth the hype. A little too dark in the room but nice romantic feel. Drinks were significantly marked up compared to other comparable restaurants. Cuts of beef are excellent but I found the food in general to be over salted. Steak frites and broccoli were cooked to perfection.
