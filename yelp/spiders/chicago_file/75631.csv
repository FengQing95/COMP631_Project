Little Goat Diner////I did not know what to expect as we went in here just for hunger and was I blown out of my mind! I didn't realize they were affiliated with Girt and The Goat and the "diner" twist was good. The entrees and deserts were delicious, I will be back!!! I suggest make a reservation to get in there as they do get packed, the food explains why ;)
