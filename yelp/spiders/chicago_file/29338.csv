Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////My mom and I walked over from our hotel and it was quite a nice walk. It was not busy when we arrived, but quickly picked up by the time we were being seated. They gave us the option of ordering our pizza in advance so we would have less time to wait at our table. Note: you only order the pizza, not additional items such as salads.
