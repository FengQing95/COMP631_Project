Smoque BBQ////I'm now a vegetarian so I will no longer enjoy their absolutely yummylicious pulled pork sandwich.. really go try it because it is soooooooooooooooo good! I need to think of new words for delicious .. anywho their mac and cheese is also good. Expect to wait for a table if you go at night though. They also have good desserts.
