Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Got the dry aged ribeye, petite duchess filet, and the Chicago cut ribeye. All three were great quaolit steaks and huge portions, but extremely salty for our tastes. You can definitely taste the nuttiness of the 42 days of dry aging. The bread was worth the carbs. Crusty on the outside, springy soft on the inside.
