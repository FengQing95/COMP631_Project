Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We started with the calamari which was pretty good but the stars of the show were definitely the pizza.  We were a party of 3 and ordered 3 medium pizzas which was pretty much enough for like 10 people.  I had the Malnati Chicago classic but i added some pepperoni, mushrooms, and hot giardiniera.  All I can say is WOW so freaking amazing.
