The Purple Pig////We had pretty high expectations after the first two dishes, but were a bit disappointed by the Spanish octopus. The octopus was over cooked and not very tender, and the potatoes were also a bit overcooked and not as crisp as I would have hoped. This is not a dish I would get again.
