Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I have been to Lou Malnati's in the past on the recommendation of a friend from a Chicago. It once again did not disappoint. We went on Wed essay night around 9pm and there was still a 20 minute wait. But it went quickly. They took our number and then exited us when our table was ready. We were also given the option of ordering our pizza ahead of time to help expedite he process when we got our table. We didn't do this but I wish we would have. While we waited for the table, we went to the bar. It wasn't big and I felt like I was in the way. When we got to the table it took about 40 minutes until we got our pizza when we ordered. The waitress recommended doing the butter crust on the deep dish pizza and we were not disappointed. There were 2 of us and we got a small pizza. It was sufficient without making us feel over stuffed and like we were wasting. Although it was so good and I would have loved leftovers. Looking forward to coming back for the deep dish.
