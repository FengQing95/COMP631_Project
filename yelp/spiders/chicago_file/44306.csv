Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The tapas I tried were the garlic potato salad, the Spanish artisanal cheeses. The cheeses were cheese (a.k.a. I can't really remember so they must not have made an impression), Â but I really liked the garlic potato salad. I think I probably hogged about half of it for myself, but I don't think anyone cared since I'm a vegetarian and don't like mushrooms, so I didn't eat any of half of the other plates. I would have liked to have tried the desserts, but the others I was with didn't want to and I didn't want to seem like a pig.
