Little Goat Diner////I had a great breakfast here. They cater to gluten free diets and dairy free. They have completely different menus for this purpose. I had the hash with corned beef. The way they shred the potatoes are so delicate and thin. We also had the summer squash. It had a wonderful texture and was topped with puffed rice. Anna was a wonderful waitress. She gave recommendation and great explanations of the meal.
