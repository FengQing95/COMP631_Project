Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Definitely a good spot for a special occasion. We came with a group of 4 for my husbands 30th birthday. We started with shrimp dejonghe and the bone barrow. The shrimp were good but nothing to write home about. The bone barrow was excellent and well worth the price. The sourdough they start you with is amazing and served warm as well. For entrees, we got the classic ribeye, the porkchop and salmon. Everything was a very good sized portion for the price and all came out perfectly. We ended by sharing one slice of chocolate pie to celebrate. The ambiance is a little dark; a little too dark. When other guests need to use their phone flashlight to read the menu, that's a good sign that it might be a bit much. But overall, the place is nice and quaint, the food was excellent and the service was on point. One tip: make a reservation well in advance. I booked ours about a month in advance and they only had 5 and 5:15 open before a 9:30 reso so we opted for the early dinner.
