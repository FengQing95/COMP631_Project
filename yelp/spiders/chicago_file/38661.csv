Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Have been to Bavette's twice now and had a fantastic evening both times. The most recent was for my girlfriend's birthday where the restaurant and Erika went above and beyond for it by bringing out a delightful wedge salad and ice cream dessert that were both covered. Fantastic ambiance for any occasion (night out with some guy friends or just the gf) that will impress. I haven't been able to get my steak cooked perfectly to my standard medium rare liking yet, but believe it's mostly circumstantial and also partly my fault for over correcting my order. The shrimp app is fantastic and the elote corn and mac & cheese are great meal accompaniments. Wine policy makes it easy to save a couple bucks, but will likely encourage you to order extra food to enjoy. I will always suggest this place for most occasions
