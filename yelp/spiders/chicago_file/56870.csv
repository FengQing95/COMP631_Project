Smoque BBQ////I had a pulled pork sandwich, and it was, in a word, Phenomenal. Best bbq pork I've had outside of north carolina (home to the best pulled pork on earth.) The meat was juicy, smoky, and tender. I didn't need a sandwich, I could have just eaten a mound of the meat on it's own. Perfection. 5 stars.
