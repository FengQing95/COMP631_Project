Little Goat Diner////Came here for a quick bite at around 9:30am on a rainy Saturday and the wait was only about 20-25 minutes for 2 people. Ordered the This Little Piggy Went to China sandwich and one of the cinnamon buns. The Little Piggy sandwich was PERFECTION. Well balanced flavors, perfectly cooked sunny side eggs, nicely toasted scallion biscuit. The cinnamon bun left a lot to be desired. It arrived warm, but was pretty dry. Maybe we got a bad one...I'd be willing to try it again.
