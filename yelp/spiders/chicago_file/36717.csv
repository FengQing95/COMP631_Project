Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We were walk-ins from the area so we Â didn't expect to be seated right away, but were willing to a seat at the bar downstairs . The bartender took forever to get to us , then after we picked out our food and drinks, we sat the menus down and waited a while again to be asked what we were going to order. The food was amazing, one of the best steaks I've ever had, we ordered the 22oz dry aged steak and the fried chicken, as well as the baked goat cheese. Honestly, my only complaint was the service
