Smoque BBQ////I have had the baby back ribs - they are excellent. They come with a dry rub which is very flavorful (sauce on the side)...the meat has that "pink" coloring that comes from a good smoking. The sauce on the side is pretty good...a little less sweet than I am used to, but still very good.
