Smoque BBQ////It's true! The best bricket lives here! I fell in love with the brisket, the cornbread, and the St. Louis ribs. Seating is a bit tricky, since you can't be seated until you place your order. There were a couple of parties that were smart (maybe not ethical though) and grabbed seats while one person from their party ordered.
