Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Pork belly and loin skewer: The weakest dish of the night. I'm pretty certain the skewer came with only loin cuts, which were extremely tough and dry. The sauce that came on the side alleviated the dryness, but I really would've preferred to see a sauce that was made for the dish than what seemed to be a generic dollop of mayonnaise-type sauce that was also used for the scallop empanadas.
