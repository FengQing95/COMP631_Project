Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////This is one of my favorite steak houses in Chicago. The ambiance and wait staff are always pleasant. To start, we had the salmon tartare and peppered duck & goat cheese terrine with apricot mustard on toast. Excellent. For my main course I chose the traditional filet mignon, which was cooked perfectly (medium rare). Absolutely delicious. I had the fries with garlic aioli as a side, but all of the sides sounded good. I can't wait to go back and try the elote style corn.
