Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////What was nice was the food and beverages. Both were really quite good. We also took the time to get the paella to split with the table, which was well worth the wait. They had a great selection of adult beverages to make anyone happy. The desserts Â were adorable! I say that because we got two sampler orders and split them, which was the right size and the right flavors. It's a very well-considered menu on the whole.
