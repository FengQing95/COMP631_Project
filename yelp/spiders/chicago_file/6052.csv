The Purple Pig////I went on a Friday evening, and waited about 2 hours, which was to be expected. Their new location does have an area indoor where you can wait, but there is VERY limited seating area, and the security in the area does not allow you to even lean on their wall or crouch down on the floor. It was therefore a very tiring 2 hours.
