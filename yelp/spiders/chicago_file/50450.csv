Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Happy hour tapas for $3! and $1 for Pintxos and $6 for glass of red Sangria. Everything was delicious I liked their chicken empanada, deviled bacon mustard eggs and garlic potato salad. It was fun get to get out eat something on the cheap and have a glass of sangria with my hubby it was a fun date night.
