Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I loved Cafe Ba Ba Reeba. I went with one of my girlfriends and we shared a half pitcher of Sangria... I believe it was raspberry. It was just the right amount. We ordered 2 tapas each plus a larger entree dish. We were full by the time the entree came. My only issue was that we were in an odd corner of the room in which the table was tilted to one side.
