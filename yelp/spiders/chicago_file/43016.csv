Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Mindblowingly delicious!!  We got 6 tapas:  short rib, shrimp, squid, bacon dates, potato, salumi, and seafood paella.  We stuffed ourselves like  3 silly little pigs.  So content and satisfying to be able to enjoy a meal like this.  We also drank passion fruit sangria and the Spanish beer.  Desert tapas are must have.  We tried butterscotch, coco flan, and apple empanadas.  Super super good too even when we were so full.  After this meal we rewarded ourselves with a nice scenic walk to the navy pier and took in the Chicago skyline.  What a special treat for our trip!!
