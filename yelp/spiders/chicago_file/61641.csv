Smoque BBQ////I ordered a brisket platter with cornbread and baked beans as sides. Honestly, the sides were the best part of the meal for me. The brisket, to me, was kinda bland. I didn't even finish it, despite the not-huge portion because it was not satisfying to my palate. I've had better barbecue in Chicago and don't get the hype surrounding this place.
