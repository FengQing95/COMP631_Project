Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We had a nice time hear enjoying different dishes and a pitcher of sangria. One note, we did not have reservations so they told us it would be a half hour wait. We walked around the back o the bar and saw four empty tables. After asking at the bar we were told we could have dinner there. Service was very good and thanks to yelp we had a nice dessert sampler for free also.
