Little Goat Diner////The second time I went was with my husband and some friends on a Saturday night.  The wait was estimated to be an hour long, normally I wouldn't wait this long but I was really excited to eat here.  We had a few drinks at the bar, which was crowded but we didn't have to wait long to get the bartenders attention and it made for a nice waiting area.  They texted us when our table was ready and we sat at a community table which was not as awkward as I thought it would be.
