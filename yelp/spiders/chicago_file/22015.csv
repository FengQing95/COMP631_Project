Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I this is the best pizza that I've had in a long while! Very thick and creamy pizza. It reminds me of lasagna. It's not quite like Neapolitan pizza; more like it's cousin that moved to America and married a Polish sausage cook. This makes Joe's Pizza in New York City looks like a sorry excuse for burnt toast with cheese wiz.
