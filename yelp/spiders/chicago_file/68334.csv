Little Goat Diner////The hash browns were the usual geared potato browned on a skillet but w a creamy goat cheese treat melting inside of it. I grew up on goat and it kinda scarred me. That pungent uric acid aroma that rises in the back if your pallet as you exhale turns me off. I overheard the party next to us rave the hash browns. Saying "so creamy but the goat cheese is undetectable and subtle". WRONG. It was delicious if you like goat cheese. But not as subtle to me. The hubs did love it. And the girls in the party next to us must have had stuffy noses.
