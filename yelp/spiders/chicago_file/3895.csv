The Purple Pig////A friend of mine visited Chicago about 5 years ago and could not stop raving about The Purple Pig. When my husband and I decided to take a vacation to Chicago, I could not wait to eat there! It did not disappoint. I went in with the expectation that we would have a long wait to be seated, but we happened to go in the late afternoon and were seated within 5 minutes. The vibe is sort of a finished industrial feel. Tables are pretty close together, and the restaurant was somewhat loud. However, the seating created a friendly environment in my opinion, and we quickly began talking to the couple sitting next to us. It gave us an opportunity to see what they ordered and get their feedback. The wine and beer list is extensive and impressive. My husband had a sour beer brewed with grapes and I had a wheat ale made with beets, both of which were wonderful. We shared 3 dishes between the two of us (Fried pig ears, smoked pork tongue, and pork jowl). All three were beyond delicious and were plenty to fill us up. The pork jowl was our favorite! The couple next to us ordered dessert and we could not resist once we saw it. We also ordered the "Sicilian Iris", an incredibly perfect beignet type dessert with ricotta and chocolate chips inside and powdered sugar on top. To die for!!! The meal was a bit pricey (about $100), but not outrageous compared to other tapas restaurants, also considering we each had a beer, meal, and dessert and were completely stuffed.
