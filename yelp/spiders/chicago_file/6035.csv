The Purple Pig////The burrata cannoli was interesting to me because I've only ever had sweet cannolis. The burrata was really light and creamy and the sauce dollops and sprouts and seeds added a wonderful nutty, tart, sweetness to the creamy burrata and crispy fried shell. Great contrast of flavors but I thought it was a little pricey since you only get 2.
