Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our server, John, was nowhere to be found for most of our meal. We waited a very long time before he even took our drink orders. I think he forgot about our pizza, because it was just warm when it finally arrived. He came around once to ask us if everything was alright, when there was only one slice of pizza left. Then, he put down our bill without asking if we wanted anything else. We ordered dessert and my boyfriend asked for a refill. Before my best friend and I could ask for more water, because our cups were empty, he was gone. He clearly wasn't paying attention and did not seem to care. The only time he was fast was when he came to pick up our check. I would have at least understood if it was busy, but it was not even crowded while we were eating.
