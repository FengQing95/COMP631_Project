Little Goat Diner////Unfortunately, this place is lives up (or down)  to it's "little" name.  The problem is not so much the food (well actually, I'd can do without a soggy Ritz cracker in my crab dip and a gummy fried onion ring), but the service is what gets me.  It blows!  How arrogant can you be to bring out people's food one at a time, especially when the entrees you are waiting on are salads, and premade salads at that?
