Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////There was still a wait even when we got to the table and got our orders of beer and apps in, but it wasn't that long.  And so worth it.  This is some serious heavy and delicious pizza.  We ordered 3 of the signature pizza's for our group of 9 and we had more than enough food.  We even had something that some people refer to as "leftovers" (something that is quite alien to my family) at the end.  Everyone left quite satisfied.
