Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I was thinking for sure I'll give it 5 stars but something make my experience uncomfortable. First, this place is extremely hard to make reservation on Saturday evening. I checked open table that I find out With in 4 months they have no table available on Saturday dinner time. So I called and walk in on a Saturday night before Xmas.I have been told about 45 mins wait. So I waited at the bar with my friend. after 1.5 hours long, Finally they seat us down. I already have two drinks that time at the bar and our waiter knows that I had two drinks. I asked him recommendation about wine and champagne. And told him bring me one champagne and two red wine for tasting then I'll choose one. Â Later he bring one full glass of champagne. I asked where are my tasting. He looked all confused then told me red wine will come back... I'm lazy to argue so I have to drink the champagne. Then I started enjoy my food. Rib eye dry aged and bone marrow and salad and few sides dishes all tasted very good. Deserve the name no 1 steak house in chicago. In the middle of the meal they sent another glass for wine without I ask.I feel wired but don't know what to do with it have to drink. I thought was their apologize of our waiting. Then the table next me offered me a glass of wine. I chat with her, told her sorry I already have enough of it. Can't drink no more. Then more chat. Then went restroom.
