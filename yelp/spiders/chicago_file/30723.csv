Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I ended up ordering a small build your own deep dish pizza (serves 2) as well as a Malnati salad. On my pizza I had pepperoni, cheese, and hot giardiniera. I wasn't too hungry and was able to eat the entire pizza without trouble. The pizza was decent, unique, but not great. I would come back here again in the future to get pizza in the hopes of having a better experience (maybe all the hype got my expectations up too high). The salad was a very artful creation. I loved the mushroom, bacon, and gorgonzola with a sweet vinaigrette dressing. It was a huge salad and I felt somewhat healthy eating it.
