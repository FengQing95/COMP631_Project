Little Goat Diner////Huge fan of Stephanie Izard, so we were excited to try this place. We walked in pretty close to closing, which I hate doing, but staff was super accommodating and welcoming and sat us right away. I had some type of cocktail that was like a Moscow Mule - delicious. But the reason I'm writing this review - is the sandwich. Good God. I can't stop thinking about it. Los Drowned. Get it. Love it. Whoa.
