Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////However, most of the food was delicious. The only plate that I did not enjoy was the apple and spinach salad that literally tasted like plain spinach with nothing else. Zero flavor. Â Everything else we tried was great. We had the grilled asparagus, goat baked cheese in tomato sauce, roasted dates with bacon, natural chicken paella, beef tenderloin and blue cheese, meatballs with sherry tomato sauce, and deviled eggs. All of the sangria was great but my favorite was the berry sangria.
