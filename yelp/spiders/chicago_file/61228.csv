Smoque BBQ////This might be the only place where I can say everything is good here. I've tried like 80% of the menu and it's all tasty. I've tried many great BBQ places in the south and this little place in Chicago rivals all of them. I guess that's not a surprise since this place has a nod from Michelin. My favorites are the pulled pork and brisket. I also really like that the menu is a la Carte, it makes for tasting various things easier. I first came here with a large group for a birthday party. They don't take reservations but the staff was kind enough to help seat our large party; very good service overall. I love this place and I will keep coming here and recommending that everyone should come here as well.
