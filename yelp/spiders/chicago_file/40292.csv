Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there's something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn't go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don't see how this is okay but we will never be back again.
