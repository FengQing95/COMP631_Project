Little Goat Diner////Sat at counter for breakfast. Server took order and disappeared. Food arrived from a runner and our order was missing a side. When server reappeared Â about 15 mins later I asked about side. She mumbled something about it coming from another station. This "station" must be in another location as the side showed up after we were done eating. No apology or comment from waitress who made her final appearance with our check in hand. Next time I drop $20 a head for breakfast it won't be here.
