Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Anytime we mentioned pizza in Chicago all the locals said we had to go to Lou's. We knew there would be a wait, which we had no problem with, but there was a 30 minute wait JUST to get your name on the list. The hostess was very friendly but the tablet she we was using to take down names was running super slow and backed up a line out the building. It was very inefficient and took away time we could have been at the bar. Once finally seated the pizza took 40 minutes to cook so by that time we were starving and anticipating the Â best pizza ever! Unfortunately when it arrived it was boarder line cold, but I could have seen past it if the flavor was there. The sauce reminded me of canned pizza sauce as Prego and overall was not memorable. We'll definitely try another pizza place next time around.
