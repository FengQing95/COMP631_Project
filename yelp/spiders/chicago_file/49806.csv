Smoque BBQ////It still seems like a better system should have been worked out by now as far as the whole place your order/ some guy writes down if you're dining in/ huge line/ yelling a number thing. And we were asked to move down one table mid-bite to accommodate a larger party, which was fine, but still...weird? They gave us free cobbler which was not necessary, but delicious! I would go to this place all the time if not for the monster line. But a Sunday lunch? Worth the wait.
