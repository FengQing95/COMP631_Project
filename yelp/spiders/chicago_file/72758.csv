Little Goat Diner//// I started off with the Hot Crab Dip.  I liked the crab dip, but I did not like the ritz crackers.  I think a crostini would have been better especially since all of their bread items are great.  The Sloppy Goat was superb, it is not your mom's sloppy joe.  It is definitely the must try at this place.  The Los Drowned is huge and delicious and every bite tastes different because there are so many ingredients.  The Apple Pie was weird and had cheese on it.  If you like a thicker crust then go for it, but I won't be ordering that or the Crab Dip again.
