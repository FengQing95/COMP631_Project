Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great ambiance/atmosphere and the service was impeccable! I especially appreciated how attentive the staff were, immediately removing plates when we were finished. Our waitress was incredibly helpful with offering up suggestions and explaining the tapas concept. Bread was given to us upon arrival and I don't know anyone who doesn't love a little freebie to begin a meal! The food came out rather quickly despite the large crowd on a Friday night. We ordered several small plates of food and two of our favorites were the short rib and the beef empanada. It was a bit expensive but a nice little treat!
