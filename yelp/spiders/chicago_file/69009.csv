Little Goat Diner////Every pickle had a tang and tart pickled flavor that married well with the crisp naan, hummus, kale and taziki sauce.  I also had the smoked fries and wished I had opted for the mac n cheese as a side instead.  The fries felt like scraps and when told to the waiter he switched them out for fresh ones that were pretty much long shoe string fries on top of more scrap fries.  I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.  I was eyeing the fish tostadas to my right and the grill cheese to my left....will have to come back for that as well as the shrimp sandwich between 6-6 on the breads side and a tiramissu milkshake!!
