Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Service was very good. The waiter was very energetic. I had a party of 11 and was able to be seated with just 4 of us there. The waiter immediately was about to bring out water and bread despite the place being crowded. The empanadas were good, as well as the chicken Pallea. The white flight was only $14, which I thought was a nice deal. Overall, my experience was great. Good food, great service. No complaints
