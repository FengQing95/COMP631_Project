Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Wait times can be very long in the morning. We put our name on the list and took a walk in Millennium Park which is right across Randolph St. Our wait was quoted as 1:15 minutes so we came back after about 45 minutes and were seated just after an hour. The food was good, in our group we tried the pancakes, the crepes and the classic eggs Benedict. Eggs benedict had a very thick tasty cut of ham. Once seated service was fast and food came out promptly. This is a very good place for breakfast but the long wait time we experienced I think is related to the premium location and the peak time that we got there.
