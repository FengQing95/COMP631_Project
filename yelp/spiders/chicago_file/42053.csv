Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Good tapas, especially the grilled calamari and the patatas (my favorite). However, its overcrowded, often very long waits, and SO loud. We had a large party in a semi-private room and the other group in the room was so loud and obnoxious we could barely talk. It was so bad that we were discussing yelling at one woman in the party to shut up, and even contemplating throwing things at her.
