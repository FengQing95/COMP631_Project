Little Goat Diner////Very good if you can survive the crowd; waited over an hour for a table for weekend brunch. However, you can grab mimosas from the bar to make the wait more tolerable. The food was great though; I still dream about that crab rangoon omelet that was a special that day, it was soooooo good. Also tried the French Toast, very tasty.
