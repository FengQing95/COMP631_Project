Smoque BBQ////St. Louis ribs - All my life I've eaten sticky, sweet baby backs, so this took a little getting used to.  The ribs are huge and meaty, with a nice thick layer of bark from the dry rub they use.  The meat itself is just firm enough to sink your teeth into, with a little effort needed to pull it away from the bone.  Eating ribs is meant to be a carnal experience, and Smoque does it exactly right.  When someone advertises ribs as "fall off the bone good", give them a scowl and walk away.  It was hard to get used to ribs that are entirely savory rather than sweet, and for personal taste I still prefer baby backs, but on their own merits these are quite good.  I just don't think I'd want a whole slab of them.
