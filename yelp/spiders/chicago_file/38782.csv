Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food was great. I didn't expect the foie gras terrine to be so heavy, but it tasted really nice on the bread. My date and I decided to try out a lot of their appetizers, and they were very flavorful and new. What REALLY stood out was the Elote style corn. I love corn. I get it almost everywhere available. This corn dish was unforgettable and after finishing the entire plate, it left me wanting more. To this day, I still fantasize about coming back solely for the elote style corn. (Which I might just do when I'm back in Chicago). We also tried the roasted tomatoes, Roasted Bone Marrow, Beef Tongue, which were both really good.
