Little Goat Diner////I've been dying to try The Little Goat since it opened but as a suburbanite don't always have opportunities to eat at the new trendy place in the city!  This place may be a "diner" but let me tell you; its not your typical greek diner with Mickey Mouse pancakes and feta omelettes.  The decor is very eclectic and the place is plenty big and comfortable with both booth and table seating.  I arrived late on a Friday morning for a business breakfast so seating was no problem.  The service was great and our waitress was very friendly, offered great suggestions and generally just seemed happy to be there (which seemed to be the vibe througout the entire restaurant).  She recommended the "KIMCHEE & BACON & EGGS & PANCAKES ASIAN STYLE BREAKFAST TASTY THING".  Now, I can't say that I'm normally up for Kimchee at 9AM but I had a feeling anything I ordered was going to be "out of this world" and besides, it had bacon in it so it had to be good!  Unbelievable...one of the best breakfast kimchee, bacon, egg asian style breakfast thingies I've ever had.
