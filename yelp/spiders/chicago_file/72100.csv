Little Goat Diner////We had the Benenden Eggs Benedict and the sloppy goat sandwich. Both were very good but Benedict was a home run. It has a creamy fish sauce that's poured over fried eggs, kimchee, pork belly, and biscuit like bread. Damn good. The sauce is esp a good compliment to the kimchee and the Â pork and eggs bring it all together. Perfect. The only knock here is that one of my eggs was over cooked. The sandwich was also good...sloppy for sure but very tasty with a warm soft yet crusty bun. Kind of was a more tomatoey pulled pork sandwich with the coleslaw but in a good way.
