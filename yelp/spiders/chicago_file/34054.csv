Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I had the luxury of having sitting at the bar downstairs.  It was the perfect setting to feel tucked away yet apart of the atmosphere.  Lighting is perfect.  Service is spot on.  The decor is ornate but not overwhelming - brilliant mix of masculine oversized tuft leather furniture and dainty glass candelabras.
