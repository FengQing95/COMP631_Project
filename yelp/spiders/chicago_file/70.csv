Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////My husband had biscuits, gravy, sausage, poached eggs and cheese with a side of hash browns; he was blown away!  I had the bliss berry french toast, which was just phenomenal as well.  I also ordered a hot chocolate (very large and tasty) and a side of applewood smoked bacon (crispy to perfection).
