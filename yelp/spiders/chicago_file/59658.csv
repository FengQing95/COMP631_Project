Smoque BBQ////Also I got to sample a rib. Which was super flavorful and smokey, but not tender. To me they were kind of tough. They are dry rubbed with sauce on the side. The sauce with these was a little strange, It actually kinda reminded me of curry, which wasn't what I was expecting to taste. I sampled some BBQ beans as well. The smoke taste in the beans was a little overwhelming, not my thing.
