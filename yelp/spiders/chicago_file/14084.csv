Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The only downside about the dining expereince is the wait to get seated when it's busy.  I've gone 1 time and been seated right away, but the other 2 times I went I had to wait almost an hour.  My advice is to go to one of the bars or resturaunts around and grab a drink while you wait.  (We went to Sushi Sambe across the street twice, sat in their loungs and got cocktails which made the wait fun!)
