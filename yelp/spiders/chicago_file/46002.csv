Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Second was for lunch. We were seated in a different area I was in the first time, close to the kitchen, and that was quite dreadful. People were constantly shuffling past us, and the food wasn't quite as good as it was the first time. Some of it was a bit too cold, some of it was so hot I thought they'd stuck it in the microwave for ten minutes.
