Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We sat at the bar and started perusing the menus.  I suggest sitting at the bar, especially if Layla and/or Ben happen to be working.  I ordered an Old Fashioned and it was the best Old Fashioned, hands down.  I've had them at several places and Ben got it right, damn right!
