Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The whole experience was wonderful.    I may be a bit slanted in my opinion as it was our 3rd anniversery and I just love my partner so much.    But the waiter eric was patient attentive and informative.     Started with cocktails bavettes punch super .     Appetizer duck tureen I think that's the name, delicious.     Sides elote style corn ( I'm not a fan of elotes)  these were delicious.   Aged bone in rib eye and some fabulous chicken dish .    Ambience was lovely.   Even patrons were so nice, two ladies next to us randomly engaged in conversation, they were delightful as well.     Can not reccomend Bavettes any higher it was just amazing.
