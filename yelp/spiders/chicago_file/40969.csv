Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Pintxo platter which is basically all 6 of the bite sized tapas they have.  We ordered it and then checked in at four square and there was a deal to get that for free!  Woohoo!  We shared the platter, so I got to try the Spanish artisanal cheese and quince, the short rib stuffed piquillo pepper, and the chorizo wrapped medjool date and cheese.
