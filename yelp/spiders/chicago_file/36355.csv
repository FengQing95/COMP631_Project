Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////It's official...I've found my new favorite Chicago restaurant!  Not even just my favorite Chicago restaurant, my favorite anywhere restaurant!  Bavette's Bar & Boeuf in River North is so gorgeous, so chic, so intimate, so PERFECT!  Any restaurant that can make stroganoff sexy is a winner in my book!
