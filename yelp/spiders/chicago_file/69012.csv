Little Goat Diner////Best thing about my meal: cup of goat chili, slice of Elvis cake. Bad taste in the mouth: the blonde receptionist, who seated everyone else before us (even the walk ins with no reservations), pretended to text us to tell us our seats were available but actually did not do so, ignored our brown faces even when we were right in front of her, then sat us near the bar even when plenty of tables and chairs were available. The waitress was sweet, as was the bakery salesperson. But that receptionist needs a major sitdown with the owners.
