Art Institute of Chicago////My favorite way to spend a rainy day, the Art Institute is one of my favorite museums in the world, obviously the best in Chicago. With plenty of recognizably famous pieces, I prefer the Joseph Cornell section. It's never that crowded over by his pieces. I also like to go early and look at the Degas.
