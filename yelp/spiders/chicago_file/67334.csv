Little Goat Diner////Spiced Apple Pancakes - were good, but not great.  While I enjoyed some aspects of this dish, I don't think I would order it again.  My best bites had a good amount of the oatmeal crumble on them, but there were many bites that were simply just "meh."  My partner said she wished there was more of the cream cheese butter on the pancakes, but she also said she didn't taste any type of spice flavor and I agreed.
