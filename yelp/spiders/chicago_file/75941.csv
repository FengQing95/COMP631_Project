Little Goat Diner////I don't know of any other place I've ever been to where I left feeling like I've made friends with complete strangers. From the guy sharing the bench outside with me as I waited to be seated inside and he waited for his blind date to show up, to the girls we shared our table (a long diner like counter or picnic table with very comfortable stools) but not our checks with, to the hostess, to the other diners who came by to pet our service dog.
