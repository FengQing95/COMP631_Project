Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's Pizzeria has fantastic pizza!  The place is always crowded.  Recently when we went there, they were sampling a new turkey sausage pizza.  It was amazing and they let us sample a mini-pizza for free.  The service was excellent and our waiter was very friendly.
