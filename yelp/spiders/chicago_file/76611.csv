Little Goat Diner////Little Goat Diner offers an extensive menu of unique twists on American diner classics. Based off whatever looked most intriguing from its Yelp album, This Little Piggy Went to China piqued my curiosity. Boy oh boy, was I sent down memory lane the experiences of eating street food in Northern China. They nailed the chili garlic chive flavor on an otherwise western biscuit and sausage breakfast sandwich. Another classic with notes of Asian flavors was their reuben sammich paired with kimchi. Quite interesting. Will come back with my cousins for a larger tasting of their eclectic foods.
