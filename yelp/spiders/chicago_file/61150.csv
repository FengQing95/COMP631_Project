Smoque BBQ////I mean this in the best way possible, we could have been in St. Louis or even KC.  I think brisket is a hard but to pull off well, but the Smoque version was quite good.  My wife is a pulled pork fan and she liked (but didn't love) her meal.  The side dishes were the perfect complement to the meal; in particular, the mac & cheese was tops.
