Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Best tapas spot in town. The patatas bravas as usual did not disappoint. The aioli dip was amazing. The special of the month was the pomegranate sangria which was delish...for desert, we tried a trio of chocolate truffle, butterscotch pudding and caramelized banana. The chocolate truffle wasn't the best but the other two were to die for.
