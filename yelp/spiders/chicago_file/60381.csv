Smoque BBQ////Went on a Tuesday night around 7:30.  The place was about 90% full with a small line to order.  We got to the order counter quick enough.  After you place your order a host will take your table requirements and promptly seat you at the first available.  Food was up within 10-15 minutes of ordering...damn that was quick.
