Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I love the dessert tapas menu. I want something sweet at the end of my meal, but don't have room for a full-sized dessert. We got the profiterole, blood orange (special) sorbet, and a little fruit cake. These were the perfect size/price for the end of the meal. I also got a coffee with my dessert.
