Smoque BBQ////They have both "St. Louis Style" and baby back ribs. I really like that you can order 1/2 slab of each as part of a meal (or you can order 1/2 or whole slab ala carte).  I ordered 1/2 of each.  The babyback ribs were a little drier than I sometimes like, but still good.  I much preferred them over the St. Louis style ribs, but honestly I think I just kind of got a bad cut.  At least 2 of the ribs were just covered in solid gelatenous fat, which was kind of nasty.  The other half wasn't like that at all.  (we had ordered it to go, I might've taken them back up to the counter had I been there).
