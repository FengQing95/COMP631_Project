Smoque BBQ////I'm a huge fan of pulled pork, so that's the only thing I've ordered both times.  I find the sauce TO DIE FOR.  After living in North Carolina, I've really become a fan of vinegar based bbq sauces, and Smoque's sauce definitely has that "tang" to it.  I could bathe in the stuff.  Friends have ordered everything else on the menu and I've tried bites of it.  I like them all, but will always stick with pulled pork.
