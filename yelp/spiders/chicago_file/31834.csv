Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So disappointed! Visiting Chicago, my husband and I carefully did our research to see where we could get the best deep dish. While competition seemed neck and neck we finally decided on Lou Malnati's to try the famous crust. We weren't surprised there was a wait (I think on a Friday afternoon we waited about 90mins). Luckily the system is very efficient, so we ordered our pizzas ahead of time and waited at a nearby Joe and the Juice.
