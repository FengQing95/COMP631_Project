Smoque BBQ////Probably the best smoked brisket and pork in the City.  You can go to white table cloth restaurants in the city and pay 50% more than this plainly designed smokehouse.  But you will not come close to the quality of food that they put out.  If there is a line inside, dont worry,  They move fast. Plus I am sure your Mom told you that "good things come to those who wait"....so wait a few extra minutes.  You will be rewarded.
