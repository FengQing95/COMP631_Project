Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered the Pepperoni deep dish pizza, and after 30-45 minutes it came out. It looked incredible. The service was excellent, as they cut the pizza in front of you and then plate your food for you. I've had a lot of pizza from a ton of places, but this was the best pizza I've ever had. The cheese stretched like it was straight out of a video. The sauce tasted amazing, and the dough was as fresh as it gets.
