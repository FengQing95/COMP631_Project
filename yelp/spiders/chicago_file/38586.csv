Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Upon entering, it was jarring how dark it was. It was still sunny outside and it was so dark inside we were walking with out hands in front of us to not bump into anything. After our eyes adjusted it was fine, but still darker than any restaurant, bar or speak easy I've ever been into. It seemed kind of stuffy.
