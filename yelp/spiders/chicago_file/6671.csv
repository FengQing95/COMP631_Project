The Purple Pig////SOO GOOD! Now I understand the hype around this place! My partner had been to their previous location and wanted to try their new one. He got us a reservation a few weeks in advance for Sunday brunch. We were seated right away when we arrived, and the place seemed quite packed and lively.
