Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The place is very nice with a cool vibe and decor. They sat us in the back and I was given a separate gluten free menu. Surprisingly is was considerably smaller than the regular menu, but I appreciated the effort to provide me with a menu specific to my needs.  I got the shrimp in garlic sauce - always get these as my baseline taste for any spanish place.  Also got the tortilla - another baseline.  My daughter got the octopus.
