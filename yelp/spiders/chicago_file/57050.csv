Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Was randomly poking around OpenTable on Friday and quite fortuitously, somebody had canceled their 7:30 pm reservation at this place. Â No other reservations available until 10 pm, nearly 3000 reviews and 4 stars on yelp, reviews mentioning 45 minute to two hour waits, plus having been to Barcelona before with good memories of Spanish tapas - it was perfect.
