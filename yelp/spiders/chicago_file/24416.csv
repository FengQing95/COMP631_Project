Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////But it was worth waiting! I visited Chicago 7 years ago and the pizza I had at that time was thick but dry. I didn't have good memories on that. Also, some friends living in Chicago didn't recommend deep dish pizza. They said it's just a one time thing. But this one was thick but still juicy and cheese and tomato sauce mixed really well. Four of us all really enjoyed the dining here. Prices are reasonable too. I paid only like 10 dollars and felt very full afterwards.
