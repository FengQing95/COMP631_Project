Little Goat Diner////The Los Drowned "sammich" was phenomenal.  The braised beef on a hoagie bun, with accompanying dipping sauce, was outstanding and I'll be hard pressed not to order it again on my next visit.  A shared order of fries was equally delightful, and the beer list was well appointed and had some favorites like "3 Floyds" as well as some lesser known options.  Good selection.
