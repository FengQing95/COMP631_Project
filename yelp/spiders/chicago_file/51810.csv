Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Without a doubt get the bacon wrapped dates, they're to die for. Short Rib and burrata were very good but not amazing. Spicy potatoes were also excellent. It was the perfect amount of food and came to about $30 a piece after tax and tip- which was well worth it and we were all full! We sat out on the covered patio which was awesome, and I was surprised how full it got on a Wednesday evening! Excited to go back and try more menu items!!
