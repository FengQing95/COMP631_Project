Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Sara went with the steak frites - a reasonably sized portion of a flat-iron steak, simply prepared and served with a side of sea salt, peppercorns, and a few other spices that you can sprinkle on.  The Bearnaise sauce was a bit thick and oily, but had a decent flavor, the steak itself was pretty solid and suprisingly tender for a flat-iron.  The fries were a bit limp and sauce, but well seasoned.
