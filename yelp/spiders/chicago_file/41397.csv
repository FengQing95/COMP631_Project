Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We went on a busy Saturday night without a reservation.  The wait for a table for four was 45 minutes to an hour...OR we could seat ourselves in the bar area, which happened to have a table for four available.  We were seated immediately and the bar staff was very helpful and knowledgeable about all of the tapas choices.  The Sangria was pretty good.  Of the dishes we tried, my favorites were the Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Alioli, Roast Dates with Bacon and Apple Vinaigrette, and the Serrano Ham, Salchichon, Chorizo & Manchego. Typing this is making me hungry!  I would definitely recommend getting a reservation.  If it's just two of you and you don't mind sitting or standing in the bar area, you might be ok without one, but otherwise, you should at least try to get a reservation the same day if possible.
