Little Goat Diner////Food: I started with the cinnamon bun and WOW was it tasty! Much of the deliciousness can, and should be, attributed to the frosting thought because the bun itself was not very good. In fact, mine was cold and pretty hard... it almost seemed like it was leftover from the previous day. For my meal I had the Corned Beef Hash and it was OUTSTANDING! This was my first time having CBH and it was a treat. The hash browns were very thinly sliced and crisped to perfection and the corned beef was so tasty. Additionally they have two eggs on top (I had mine poached) but really it could use probably four total - the yolk adds such good flavor to the whole dish.
