Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I got the chocolate chip pancakes and a skillet, and although both were pretty good (and the staff was very friendly), they weren't as amazing as some of the other reviews led me to believe. I definitely wouldn't call them the best pancakes in Chicago, although they are good and perhaps the specialty flavours are even better.
