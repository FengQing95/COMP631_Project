The Purple Pig////It's a pretty good place to day drink and eat Mediterranean food. I got a roasted broccoli with toasted bread crumbs and anchovy vinaigrette. It tastes exactly like roasted broccoli with a thick sauce. I got this because of the Yelp reviews. I honestly do not think I tried the right dishes at the Purple Pig because $40 down, I still don't understand why people are super crazy about this place. The table next to us tried a lot of dishes that seemed more interesting. One was a bone marrow smear dish and many tables got the beet (antipasti?).
