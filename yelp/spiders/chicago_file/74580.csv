Little Goat Diner////We dropped in for drinks and a quick bite while in queue for nearby Au Cheval (which was a 3-hour wait!). There was no wait to be seated when we walked in. We quickly ordered a few drinks - the Moscow Goat, old-fashioned and a honey whiskey cocktail. Then we ordered our "snacks" - Macho Nachos and fried pickles and onion rings.... dang. Those nachos were NO JOKE - they were massive & soooo good.
