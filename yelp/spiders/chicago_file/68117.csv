Little Goat Diner////My husband and I visited the Little Goat Diner for brunch recently while we were in Chicago for the Pearl Jam concert recently. Stephanie Izard seems to have really done it right by taking her time getting her places up and running after her Top Chef win. The hour-long wait was a bit daunting, but we toughed it out, and boy -- were we glad we did. Simply put, the food was awesome.
