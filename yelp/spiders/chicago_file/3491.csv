The Purple Pig////Moving on, I recommend the grilled broccoli, crispy pig's ear, milk-braised pork shoulder, and for my adventurous food enthusiasts, the roasted bone marrow. The broccoli is nicely charred and garlicky with a hint of acidity from the vinaigrette. While the crispy pig's ear and roasted bone marrow sound a bit off-putting, it is beyond delicious. The pig's ear is satisfyingly crunchy, has the all-too-familiar taste of bacon and goes well with the fried egg tossed together. The bone marrow requires an adventurous palate, but it truly is "meat butter". It is rich, nutty, buttery and will melt in your mouth. Spread it over the sliced baguette with a sprinkle of salt and you will become a believer. Finally, the milk-braised pork shoulder is probably the most tender dish I have had in Chicago. The Purple Pig really took a cheap cut of pork and elevated it in terms of tenderness and taste! The bill can get steep, but it really is a price I'm willing to pay.
