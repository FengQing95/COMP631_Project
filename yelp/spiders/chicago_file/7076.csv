Art Institute of Chicago////A must-see for modern art enthusiasts. A magnificent collection of art, capped off with "La Grande Jatte." Truly, a beautiful building to appreciate all the art and artifacts within. Also, we were told the beginning of Route 66 is right in front of the museum (and I just so happen to be listening to Depeche Mode's cover of Route 66 as I Yelp).
