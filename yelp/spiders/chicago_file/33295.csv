Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Food was AMAZING, service was great, and they have a very creative corkage fee...it's BYOB and instead of paying a corkage fee you have to donate a glass of whatever you're drinking to another patron of your choice. They have a great cocktail/beer list too. Prices were a bit high but well worth it.
