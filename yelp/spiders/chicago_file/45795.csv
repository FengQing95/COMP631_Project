Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I took my parents here and we ordered 9 different tapas, and each and every one of them were almost as good as the last (especially the shrimp and crab gratin). Â The inside of the restaurant is really nice looking, and there is a pretty nice outdoor seating area, although it was a bit too humid to sit out there last night.
