The Purple Pig////Was the highlight of my Chicago trip. I was able to make a lunch reservation fairly easily by calling in on a Monday afternoon. We were seated promptly and the waitress gave us a rundown on what's popular and things to get. No surprise, she mentioned the Bone Marrow (which we were going to get anyway) the Grilled broccoli, and Crispy Pig Ears. We got all three of them. The Bone Marrow was LEGIT. Perfectly roasted, generous amount of salt, paired with herbs (believe they were parsley from memory), and nice toasted bread. It was like spreading butter onto the bread, so smooth and good! I would get this EVERY TIME.
