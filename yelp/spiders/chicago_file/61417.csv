Smoque BBQ////We eat at BBQ places all over the Midwest.  The pulled pork meat was tender and flavorful.  The handcut fries were the best part if the meal.  The St. Louis ribs were very tough but had good flavor.  The sides were nothing special.  The sauces could use some work.    The service wasn't very friendly or helpful.  I doubt we will be back.  St. Louis is the only place e to go for good BBQ!
