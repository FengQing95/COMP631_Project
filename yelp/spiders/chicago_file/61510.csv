Smoque BBQ////Yumitty-yum-yum-yum!!!  This BYOB restaurant was a card in our "a-la-card" deck and was the first card we used.  They were out of their brisket the night we went, but that wasn't my first choice anyhow so no biggee.  The staff was super-nice and made sure we were well aware they were out of brisket before we got in line.
