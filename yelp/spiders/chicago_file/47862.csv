Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I would call the food, mediocre.  Something for everyone.  Nothing hit me to the point where I was like,  "Man I gotta eat that again!"  Don't get me wrong, food was fine.  Just nothing really popped out.  The drinks however were great.  Their mojitos were refreshing!  I would not come back on my own, but if a friend wanted to come here, I'd come back.  Great ambiance.
