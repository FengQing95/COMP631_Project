Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Price was too high. I'll say that up front. In the end we dropped almost $100 per person for 3 of us. We got a lot of stuff but I don't know if the price justified what we ate. No, in fact, I'm sure it did not. I try my best to not let price get in the way of a review. But I make exceptions for extremely cheap food (eg, $2 breakfasts at Chinatown) and extremely expensive food. The recap is that this is very good, but at this price, I can't justify going here.
