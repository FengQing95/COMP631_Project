Art Institute of Chicago////My husband had noticed that their was an Edvard Munch exhibit, and since that happens to be one of my favorite artists, it was the perfect excuse to go. I enjoyed the exhibit greatly. Skillfully lit, perfectly displayed, and very informative. I enjoyed the mix of artwork from Monet and other artists of the same type also in the same exhibit. It was well worth the extra admission. And they also had an personal audio tour available. I declined, since I wanted to explore on my own. From what I could tell, the audio tour allowed people to ignore their surroundings, and not pay attention to what was going on around them. I couldn't even count the number of times I was bumped into or stepped on by some fool wandering around with a pair of headphones on and a glazed look on their face.
