Little Goat Diner////We were considering bringing a vegan friend here and expressed concern to the waiter, who immediately returned with an entire Vegan menu -- unexpected for a place with so much meat goodness; the items looked good and they had some interesting things like the scallions and kimchi pancakes which was basically my wife's dish minus the meat -- keep in mind both our dishes were delicious even independent of the pork belly.
