Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great ambience for dinner and brunch.  The entrees and the tapas are delicious and the drinks are also great.  The entrees are a little pricey, so my boyfriend and I typically get a tapas platter, possibly two and leave satisfied.  I go as often as I can, and if you haven't tried it, you should!
