Art Institute of Chicago////Not just for artsy-fartsies, the Art Institute offers so much amazing-ness in one building! There's famous art (Seurat's Sunday Afternoon, Picasso's Old Guitarist, etc.), Asian art, installation works, detailed miniature rooms, even a Chicago Stock Exchange room! It's mind-blowing how much the Institute has, and you don't have to travel overseas to see it (unless, I suppose, you were overseas to begin with).
