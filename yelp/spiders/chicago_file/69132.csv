Little Goat Diner////We ended up starting with the goat chili cheese fries which were delicious.  Large serving that was plenty for 3 to share.  Then our meals arrived.  I had the reuben, one friend had the patty melt and the other had the burger.  I loved mine...loved the beef prepared in house pastrami style and the kimchi kick which made it a little different.  The patty melt was a thumbs up as well (especially for the added pickle slices).  The burger was a thumb sideways.  It was good but nothing special.  Then we shared the cookie pie which was really delicious too.  It actually was like a chocolate chip cookie in a pie crust with ice cream on top.
