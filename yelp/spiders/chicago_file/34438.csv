Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Starter: We started with the lump crab cake-- great choice. This crab cake was cooked to perfection and already flavored with some lemon. The crab cake had a very decent amount of actual crab chunks in it, which is essential for a good crab cake (I hate when they beef up the crab cafe with other nonsense to make it seem bigger). Portion size was very generous, and it came with a really flavorful dipping sauce.
