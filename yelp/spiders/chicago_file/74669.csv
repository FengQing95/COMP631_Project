Little Goat Diner////Went for breakfast on Sunday and enjoyed ourselves. We made a reservation for 8am, and good thing, since it was pretty busy. I don't normally care for breakfast places where everything is a la carte though. I got the seasonal omelet (ham and cheese) and enjoyed it. My husband got the biscuits and gravy and he liked the gravy a lot; the biscuit was a little dry. The cinnamon roll was good, but a tad dry as well. It was a good meal for sure, but I don't think I would go out of my way to return.
