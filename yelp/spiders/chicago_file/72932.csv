Little Goat Diner////This place is to die for!! Definitely one of my favorite places in the whole city. My boyfriend and I are huge fans of Stephanie Izard and this restaurant is maybe my favorite of her three Chicago restaurants. It can get super busy and a little crowded but it's so worth it. The atmosphere is incredible and the food is even better. I wish I could give it 6 stars.
