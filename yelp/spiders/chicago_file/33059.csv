Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////One of my top 5 go to spots and by far my fave among Brendan Sodikoff's restaurant empire. The bone marrow paired with the dry aged bone in rib eye is quite the carnivore's affair. Ambiance is hipster cowboy meets Parisian saloon, but I'll definitely recommend making reservations months in advance. Try the elote style corn...the taste elicits a little 'je ne sais quoi'...
