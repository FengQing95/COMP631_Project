Smoque BBQ////My neighbors bought smoque for their daughters birthday and invited me to the party. I was amazed at how fun the food was. It had all the sauces on the side and they had pulled pork, chicken, and brisket. It was served in catering style foil containers and there was so much of it. When he told me what he paid, I became ecstatic about using Smoque for my next party. I'm addicted and can't wait to try again!
