Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered a classic (sausage) and a cheese with pepperoni. We got one with the butter-crust ($.75 up-charge) just to see what that was about but there really wasn't much of a noticeable difference. Â Maybe the butter-crust one didn't get as hard on the edges when it got colder later.
