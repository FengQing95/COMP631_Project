Little Goat Diner////The service was bad. Being called "sweetheart" and "doll" is kind of endearing when it is a 60 year waitress who has worked at that diner since before you were born. From a young hipster? Not so much. My beverage - ordered at the earliest possible moment after being seated - was delivered when I was halfway done eating my meal. I might give them a bit of a pass if the cafe was really busy and they actually brewed my tea properly, but if all you are doing is delivering hot water with a tea bag in it? That should have been here 20 minutes ago -- before my dining companion got her milkshake, for sure. Also, bringing the check before we are done with the meal is a huge no-no in my book. Check to see if we want dessert! It's a diner. There is a better than average chance we want pie. Pie is the whole point of going to a diner!
