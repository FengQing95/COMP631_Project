Little Goat Diner////The stars perfectly aligned for my visit to Little Goat.  I'm a huge fan of Chef and love G&G.  So, I was giddy to drop in and give the lil guy a try.  Jam packed for lunch at the high noon hour.  Flying solo, I was able to take it right to the counter.  I kept turning around from my seat to take it all in.  This space has been completely redone and bears only the address in relation to the prior tenant Red Light.  Diner on one side, Bread on the other.
