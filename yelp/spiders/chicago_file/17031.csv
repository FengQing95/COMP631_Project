Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We enjoyed Lou's pizza.  We ordered the classic-Lou pizza, with a family sized Cesar salad.  The pizza was absolutely delicious, very flavorful & filled us up!  The combo appetizer was not tasty to us.   It seemed as if all was frozen food & just fried.....nothing homemade about it.
