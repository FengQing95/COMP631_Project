Art Institute of Chicago////I'm not worthy!  I'm not worthy!  Went on their free night (Thursday from 5:00pm to 8:00pm) and managed to catch some Gaugins, Van Goghs, Rodins, Monets, Dalis, Matisses, Picassos, Seurats, Manets, Renoirs, Toulouse-Latrecs, Degas....the list of heavy hitters goes on and on.  I'm still spinning from shock, awe and sheer wonderment.  Seriously I'm just not that worthy.  A+ all round and definitely not to be missed.
