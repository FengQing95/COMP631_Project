Little Goat Diner////I visited the Little Goat Diner on a trip to Chicago earlier this year and cannot stop thinking about their biscuits and gravy.  I would go there every week, just for that, if I didn't live 800 miles away.  The coffee was also pretty awesome, so all in all, it was a hit.  If you're in Chicago, it's a must!
