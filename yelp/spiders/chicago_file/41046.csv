Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Usually, service at this place is 4-star, but the server I had today - PABLO R. - best server ever! He wasn't your usual overtly nice server, but in fact genuinely cared about his customer and didn't have to say much to show it! Dropped my fork by accident and didn't bother asking for another - but there he was with a new set a minute later!
