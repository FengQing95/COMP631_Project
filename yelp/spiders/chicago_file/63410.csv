Smoque BBQ////After being spoiled in St. Louis, I was concerned that Chicago couldn't satisfy. Smoque has proven that I was mistaken. It is consistently my favorite BBQ in Chicago. The STL style ribs have a flavorful rub and the meat falls of the bone. Fries and slaw are idyllic. When I save room (a difficult feat) the bread pudding is a joy. Their service is great and they seem to give job opportunities to local kids. Also, Smoque is reasonably priced for a BBQ joint.
