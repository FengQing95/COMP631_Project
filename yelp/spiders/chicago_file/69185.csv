Little Goat Diner////We got there and took seats, like hungry and cool kings in a giant food castle where you can eat the walls and rugs and even the chairs and stuff. I did the ordering because Big D's no foodie like me, so I kinda pointed at the menu and raised my eyebrows and tried to smile at the waiter guy till he picked something for us. Well, we got the good times rolling with some of them big poofie puffy potato puppies, which had all my favorite flavors and came out hot and fer-resh as hell! U guys know I'm a real-deal flavor hunter, and let me tell you these had such flavor you will never forget it! Â I looked over at Big D so happy with my eyes big as moons but there he sat, a sad Little D, forlorn and broken. He pushed his food around with his fork like babies do and I tried to make that joke that he likes about what did the peach say to the orange but I forgot the ending so it kinda ruined the whole thing and I knew things were coming to an end, that i might not see him again for a while.
