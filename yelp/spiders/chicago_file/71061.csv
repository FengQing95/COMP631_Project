Little Goat Diner////We were planning to eat around the block, but the wait was too long, so we stumbled into Little Goat on a Wednesday night. Plus, we all have been wanting to try this place out as well. The restaurant was packed as I expected, but we were still seated right away. We started with the Hot Crab Dip because it seemed popular on Yelp. We all thought it was a bit too salty. They do give you refill on the Ritz crackers, which is nice. I got the Los Drowned and this was pretty good for the most part, but I felt like I expected more. My gf ordered the Pork Belly Pancake and she said it was good. This was probably our favorite dish here. My friend ordered the Goat Almighty Burger and it was huge. It looked amazing, but it ends there. The meat was a bit dry and it just ended up being a regular burger that had a lot of stuff in it. Overall, this place was good, but I expected a lot more from Little Goat. We had really high hopes coming in here based on the reviews and our experience with Girl and the Goat. I will definitely come back in the future to try other things and hopefully update my review!
