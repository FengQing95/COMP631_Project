Little Goat Diner////The more casual offshoot of the Girl and the Goat, Little Goat has a more relaxed but still scrumptious menu. I recommend visiting this place during off hours, as they don't take reservations-- maybe a late or early lunch. Visiting Little Goat after Girl and the Goat will increase your appreciation for the restaurant series. Happy dining!
