Smoque BBQ////The best BBQ in the city. Possibly the best BBQ outside of Texas. I had pulled pork, jalapeno cheddar sausage, mac and cheese, bbq beans, and slaw. The pork was juicy and melted in my mouth. The sausage was smoky and spicy, with a crisp casing without being dry. The sides were delicous. Nothing needed the smoky bbq sauce, but I still put it on everything. Can't wait to be back to try the brisket and ribs. Everything on my plate was consumed, and I collapsed into a food coma without regrets.
