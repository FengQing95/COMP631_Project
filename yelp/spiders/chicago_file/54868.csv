Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////-Check-in on Yelp and you get a free dessert. Surprisingly, because we all checked in, they let us all get a free dessert. It was NOT one per table. We tried four different ones and passed them around the table in true tapas fashion. They were about 5 bites a piece and hit the spot! My personal favorite was the rich chocolate cake!
