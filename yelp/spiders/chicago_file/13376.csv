Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////They do have a gluten-free pizza option, but it's NOT a normal crust! Instead, they use a big, flat disc of sausage instead of a bread crust. It's something unusual, and I'm glad I tried it, but keep in mind, if you order it, that's it's not "pizza" so much as "sausage patty with cheese and tomato sauce".
