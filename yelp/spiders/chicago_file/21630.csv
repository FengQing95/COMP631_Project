Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We got thw house salad, a blend of tomaine and spinach topped with fresh tomato, mushroom, gorganzola cheese, olives, and my favorite part, the crispy salami bits. I could've just feasted on those the entire day. The regular portion was the perfect size for two as an appetizer, and only left a few minutes before finishing that and our pizza arriving.
