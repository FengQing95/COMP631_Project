Little Goat Diner////I can't say much that hasn't already been said.  Stephanie is a genius.  The sourdough pancakes were amazing.  The french toast was unlike anything I've ever had...I can't stop thinking about it.  It's great to actually see Stephanie in the kitchen.  The bread store next door is also really good if you are in a rush and want to get in and out...although I wasn't a fan of the oatmeal.  It's not cheap but they always have good samples set out to nibble on while you wait.  Now if only Dragonfly would close and Stephanie could do something else amazing on Randolph.....She could take it over like Rick Bayliss did on Clark Street.
