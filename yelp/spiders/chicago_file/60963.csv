Smoque BBQ////Luckily I had zero wait time, no line and no crowd at all - trust me, it is worth none of all of that (Zagat and Guy Fieri can be damned if those bitches disagree). But if you're in the area and it's about 3-5pm with no line or anything, feel free to have yourself a decent and probably forgettable meal (as long as you don't make the critical mistake of hyping it up in your own head too much...). And the people who work here are super sweet, which always makes even mediocre food go down easier. I'll probably visit again, too - I'm not always lucky enough to be near better bbq.
