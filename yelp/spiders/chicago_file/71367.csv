Little Goat Diner////We went for dinner but I think the breakfast and brunch menu is probably what has given this restaurant a high rate. The fried chicken was bland, the biscuit it came with was over cooked, the chicken fingers were also overcooked and the pork & shrimp spaghetti had a little too much fish sauce and salt in it. On the plus side, the nachos were DELICIOUS albeit the chips slightly overcooked. The fried pickles were also yummy. I'd go back to try out their brunch menu.
