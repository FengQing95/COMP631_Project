Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We had trouble deciding what to order, there are so many great options, I don't think you can go wrong! The sangria was amazing (we tried the classic red); seriously, the best I've ever had. There were three of us in our group; we split about 8 plates: from pinxtos platter to goat cheese in tomato sauce, brussel sprout salad to spicy potatoes, and three different meat plates (Spanish sausages, beef skewer and short ribs). It was all amazing. I'd order those plates again, except that I would also want to try new things!! With that said, my favorites were the roasted dates with bacon and apple vinaigrette (coming from someone who doesn't usually like dates - they were heavenly), rioja-braised short ribs, spicy potatoes and the brussel sprouts. It was a great dining experience. I look forward to coming back!
