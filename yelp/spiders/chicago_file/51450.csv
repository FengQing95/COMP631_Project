Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The prices and portions of Caf√© BabaReeba's foods are quite good. Note that it is a tapas place and hence most items are small portions and are meant for sharing. Please be sure to come with a few friends so that you can make the most of your experience by trying a bunch of different items without breaking bank. And given the wide variety of food offered here, it is well worth trying a handful of different items.
