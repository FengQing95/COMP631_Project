Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////In Chicago and it's my last night... had to try deep dish Chicago-style pizza in its hometown. I've had it at Uno's at other locations outside of Chicago, but there's nothing like the hometown, right? Decided to try Lou Malnati's based on Yelp reviews and just found it to be "ehhh".
