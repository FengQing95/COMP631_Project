Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////What came out after 35 minutes changed my view on pizza forever. From the first slice, which is cut and served to you by the bartender, I was taken to a happy place. The best part of this pizza is hands down, the sauce. There's an abundance of it and it taste as if someone spent hours putting it together. It's about as perfect of pizza sauce as you can get.
