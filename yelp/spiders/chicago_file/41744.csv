Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////With so many high reviews I expected greatness but was met with mediocre tapas and average sangria. The shrimp was good - and chorizo wrapped date was pretty standard. The goat cheese in tomato sauce tasted like a drunk friend made appetizers out of the pantry - canned food for sure. The potatoes were basic but the dipping sauce was pretty good. I went on a weekday with a friend, so perhaps that contributed to the mediocrity. We also tried the tapas ice cream sandwiches - which had a good flavor pairing, but it's not very logical to put ice cream between two burnt gingerbread cookies. They need to be soft so the ice cream doesn't splooge everywhere. If you want good food - go to Bien Trucha. This is my first yelp review - just couldn't let the top reviews summer in a facade of quality food.
