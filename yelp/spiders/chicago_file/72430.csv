Little Goat Diner////The best thing about Little Goat is it's a very relaxed simplified version of Girl & the Goat. Almost anyone should be able to find something they like on the menu, and they have so many different cuisine types to choose from. I quite enjoy the salads they have here for lunch, yet around dinner I will have a tasty beverage and choose a meal that's a littler more decadent. If you're not a very adventurous eater, this is one of Stefanie Izard's restaurants you should be a little more willing to try!
