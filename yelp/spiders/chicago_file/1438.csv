Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////In town for business and I love breakfast. Great menu selections with very creative entrees. I had the fresco omelet. I didn't know provolone cheese could be so creamy!! Â I had a side of the blueberry glazed pancakes but nothing too special about that. Good service and very reasonably priced.
