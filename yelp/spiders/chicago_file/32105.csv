Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We came for deep dish pizza and they're known for their buttery crust which tastes like an overbaked biscuit. The crust is delicious and crunchy; however it's heavy on the cheese and very light on the sauce. We went on a weekday so it wasn't crowded and no lines. We were seated immediately. Deep dish pizza took about 45-60 mins to bake since it's a thick pie.  Our pizza was made incorrectly by accident so our serve informed us and offered us an appetizer on the house. We chose traditional chicken wings with 2 sauces: honey BBQ and garlic Parmesan, and OMG...they were delicious. The wings were small but they were fried to perfection!!! The sauces were to die for!!! The ranch was also super delicious and didn't have the heavy ranch taste. If you'd like a saucy pizza, Lou won't satisfy you. If this is your first time in Chicago, first time trying deep dish pizza, and in love with A LOT of cheese, go for Lou to experience it since it's so popular.  If you want a hearty and well balanced pie, go to Giordano's. If you want a pan style (thick crust) with caramelized cheese crust, go to Pequods. I like Lou's but I probably wouldn't come back because I like my pizza to be saucey and less cheesy. It'll come down to personal preference.
