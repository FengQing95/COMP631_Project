Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I was a bit hesitant with all of the hype around this place that it would be more trendy than quality, but I am SO glad I was wrong.  The food here was AMAZING.  Maybe one of the best meals I have had in Chicago.  The restaurant is small and dark, but still a great ambiance.  The service was outstanding; as were the cocktails.  We had the mixed green salad, dry aged ribeye, roasted chicken, baked potato, and brussels sprouts.  For desert we had the chocolate pie.  Everything was outstanding, and was more than enough food for four people.  I highly recommend Bavette's and can't wait to go back!
