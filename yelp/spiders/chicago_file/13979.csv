Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I don't get what all the fuss is about with this place. I am not a native Chicago resident so when we first moved here this place was talked about all the time. I was so excited to try this place after a few others were great (giordanos and Genos east) but left feeling ripped off as the pizza really wasn't very good especially for the price. It was beat they had little samples to snack on as you wait but the pizza really wasn't anything to rave about-what am I missing? Is there a specific pizza that is better than the others? I'm not seeing it, sorry :/
