Smoque BBQ////I don't get the hype behind this place. I ordered a sliced brisket and pulled pork platter with a "taste" of st louis style ribs with mac and cheese and peach cobbler. I NEVER add salt to my food and apparently this place doesn't either! Seems they used all of it up salting the sidewalk during the winter. The texture of all the meats were a little off, it wasn't quite tender nor could it be deemed chewy. Sampled my friends' texas sausage and fries. The sausage was lacking in the flavor and salt department but the fries tasted like In N Out fries. The service was great with no wait on at 9 pm on a Friday night. Would not return.
