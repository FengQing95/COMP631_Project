Little Goat Diner////Looking at the menu ahead of time, I'll admit I was a bit apprehensive at some of the flavor combinations.  But, everything came together quite well!  I enjoyed pretty much every dish (the kale and chickpea salad wasn't quite my thing), and they were all served beautifully.  My favorite though, was the chocolate pavlova dessert-I'm not a huge chocolate fan, but it was the right balance of chocolate and other flavors.
