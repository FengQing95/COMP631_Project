Smoque BBQ////That said, everything else was just ok.  The pulled pork was a bit dry... The baked beans were a bit too sweet and soupy in my opinion... The St. Lois ribs were good but not great (tougher than I like).  Lastly, the cornbread was pretty standard fare for cornbread, and the much touted mac 'n cheese was good, but not super flavorful and was a little too creamy for me.  All in all, 3-stars seems like a reasonable review based on my experience.  Good, but not oh my freaking god good.
