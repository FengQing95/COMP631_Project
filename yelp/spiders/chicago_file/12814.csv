Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////For my money, Lou Malnati's is the BEST deep dish pizza anywhere (that buttercrust is ridiculously good)! Gino's East is still excellent. I'm a big fan of Giordano's, Carmen's, Uno's, Edwardo's and Home Run Inn (thin) and Connie's (thin or stuffed) are sublime if you have it at the restaurant.
