Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou's wins my customer service award.  This place was crazy the night they lit the Mag Mile lights and I had a major miscommunication with the hostess.  Long story short, I thought that putting my name in but foregoing the immediately available table to allow the rest of my party to arrive would put me at the head of the line when my party was complete.  When the hostess put me at the end of the line (i.e. 60-90 minute wait) when they did arrive, the manager stepped in and gave us the next table.  I was probably in the wrong, but I was so impressed with the service that I vowed to give them a great Yelp review.
