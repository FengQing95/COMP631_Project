Little Goat Diner////At that point, I felt that we should have asked for a manager but my friend was trying to be courteous. The waitress leaves our table and I am sitting where I have a good view of the kitchen and I notice the waitress talking to the Chef and showing him the food. He looks at the food and clearly is irritated. He grabs the plate from her and we assumed that the chicken was zapped in the microwave for a minute or two. The waitress does not wait around to see if my friend is satisfied and walks away. We notice that the chicken is much more tender and the right color, on the surface but once my friend cut into the meat, we again notice pink and give up on eating the rest of our food. Â
