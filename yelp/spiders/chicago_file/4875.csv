The Purple Pig////Be mindful coming in... the way they designed the place is totally not meant for people who are claustrophobic! Seriously!! There is an outdoor tent area for you to wait but once you head through their poorly designed tented door/make-shift hallway it's chaos. My cousin and I were sat at a table where the layout of it is long and rectangular. So I was sitting next to another woman and her girlfriend. Idk, maybe I'm being too much of a complainer but damn I'd like my own table!
