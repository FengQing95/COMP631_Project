Little Goat Diner////We showed up for breakfast, we were in town for Lollapalooza- a popular music festival, and really only had breakfast and lunch to explore Chicago's food scene since we'd be at the festival during dinnertime. Knowing I didn't have a shot at Izard's other restaurants, I happily took the opportunity to head to Little Goat Diner for breakfast.
