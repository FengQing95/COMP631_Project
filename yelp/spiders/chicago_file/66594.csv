Little Goat Diner////At LG Bread, I first tried out the goat cheese bagel with honey schmear, and it was a delicious start to my day.  The bagel rivaled those I have had in New York, and it had a great chewiness that bagels are often missing around here.  The schmear was good too, but not all that remarkable.  I also purchased a banana espresso muffin, which sounds good in theory, but it was just awful.  I only ate a little before I had to throw it out, which for someone who loves all pastries just felt plain wrong (but it was that bad)!  I don't know if it was the espresso or if someone put in too much baking powder, but there was a really bitter and off-putting flavor to the muffin.  My sis, however, tried the apple spice cake and said it was delish.  Maybe they just need to tweak the muffin...
