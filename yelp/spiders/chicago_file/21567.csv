Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I chose Lou Malnati's as the deep dish pizza try on my recent Chicago trip.  It was just okay.  Exactly as I expected.  There is really no point making comparison to other pizza styles, either, due to the fairly significant differences between the deep dish and other styles.  At this time I can't say whether Lou Malnati's represents a good, average, or poor product of the style.  However, odds are not great that I would ever truly *love* a dish that resembles a meaty, cheesy casserole with pie crust.  I might enjoy a slice or two when hungry.
