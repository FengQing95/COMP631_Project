Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I've been here a couple times and always waited an hour or so to be seated. Luckily there's plenty of places to kill time nearby. Got seated. Our waiter was like the most social person ever. He was super nice and helped us strategize our order. It was July 4th weekend so it was kind of busy so our pizza took some time. Luckily we had some delicious wings to chow through. Eventually our pizza came out and it wasn't like any deep dish I've had. It was super watery and didn't look appetizing at all. But I trusted the restaurant. It was pretty gross and subpar for pizza which is still very delicious. Even the worst of pizza is still like a 6 on the scale of food in general. But pretty disappointing for deep dish pizza in the Mecca of deep dish pizzas waiting weeks for the cheat meal and spending more time waiting than actual eating. You get it. I expect more!
