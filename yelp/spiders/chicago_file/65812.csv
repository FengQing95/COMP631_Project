Smoque BBQ////We had a proper Memphis-style bbq dinner here during our tour of Chicago. While the ribs and pulled pork and brisket were wonderful, the star of the show was the not-on-the-menu candies jalape√±os! Sweet yet slightly spicy, these little atomic morsels were unique and delicious! We also enjoy the brisket chili which was packed with flavor!
