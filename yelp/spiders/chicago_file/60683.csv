Smoque BBQ////Oh yeah, and they have great barbeque too. :) The brisket is to die for - juicy and tender and dripping in sauce!  When my co-worker told me she was going to get takeout from Smoque for her birthday, I started salivating at my desk.  And this place is a trek for me.  It means walking and taking two different bus lines just to sit down at their tables and nosh.  But believe me, it's all worth it.
