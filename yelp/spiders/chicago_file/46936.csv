Smoque BBQ////Having been born and raised in the south, I've been dying for a decent BBQ place to open in this city. And while this place isn't great, it's the only decent place around. They smoke their meats unlike some places around here that think it's OK to boil it. The ribs are probably the best thing on the menu. I always go St. Louis style.
