Little Goat Diner////I respect those who respect the product and the food and the execution..this girl IS on fire!  Chef and her staff.. they get it... the product, the food, execution,  service (they actually know what's in everything), decor, ambiance.. it's a whole experience here.. we took a stroll outside and then came back and checked out the bar/bakery area and then finished our wait by the the main entrance.. we were quoted roughly 1  hr and I think we were seated at 45 min. mark.. which was fine.. I also enjoyed the gracious offer of a tasty sampling while we were waiting.. I thought it was a nice touch.. I really love that Chef clearly makes a conscience effort to be accessible to all diners, budgets etc.  I didn't mind the wait.. it was worth it! .I could go on and on about the food each and every bite  was so thoughtful which I believe is a running theme throughout the experience you have here..icing on the cake.. was that seeing her behind the line cooking her ass off!!   Can not wait to come back!!
