Little Goat Diner////Tables all around us bustle with the beginnings of a day. The cacophony of utensils hitting plates, silverware being bussed, ice cubes, the hostess calling out a new name, fills the atmosphere with a thickening agent. I'm nodding mindlessly. Little Sis is looking thinner, and not just skinny, but muscular. Her shoulders are starting to cap, small but hard looking traps running to a slender neck. I'm imagining us as the couple in the diner opening of Pulp Fiction. I'm leaning out of my seat over the formica table, sipping my coffee, wearing a loose fitting cabana shirt, and the camera jump-cuts to our faces each time we talk, always spitting out something clever, rapid fire, the street outside our window goes from day to night to day to night to day again.
