Smoque BBQ////Best BBQ in Chicago if you ask me. As a girl, the meat isn't fat packed (it's all melted off), the sides aren't too large, and the BBQ sauce is delicious. Parking is a nightmare and the place is obviously way too small for the amount of business they do -- but what good restaurant isn't too small! I swear it's all in their plan..
