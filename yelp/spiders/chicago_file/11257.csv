Art Institute of Chicago////Challenging, amazing, sometimes head-scratching works, some familiar, some not, but always a soul-filling experience throughout the museum. "World Class" definitely, and one is never disappointed - some of art's greatest hits live here. It's always fun to wander around and explore the nooks and crannies of lesser-known galleries, since what's on display changes often.
