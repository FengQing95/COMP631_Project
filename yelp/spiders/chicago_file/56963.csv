Smoque BBQ////My daughter and I saw this on Check Please and decided to check it out for real. I don't know much about great BBQ but I do know that was the best damn mac n cheese and BEANS I have ever tasted. The husband is picky about ribs but he was happy as can be, he said they were the best ribs he's had. I don't think my daughter said one word the whole meal, it was that good. I recommend the brisket, seems like that was everyones favorite.
