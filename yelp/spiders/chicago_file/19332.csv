Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Who would complain about this place?!  Awesome pizza!  Yes, it is pricey and yes you may wait for a long time to sit down, that's because it is that awesome of a place!  Yes, you will wait 45 minutes for a pizza, order a head of time if you are that impatient or order a salad while you wait!
