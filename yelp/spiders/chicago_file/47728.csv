Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Tapas with a twist! I try something new everytime and everything is good to awesome. His place has the best atmosphere - with a wide assortment of clientele in the best way possible. I always bring people here if they are visiting. I have been seated in both the patio and bar areas - love them both. Whether you just happen to be in Lincoln park - or you want a good meal with a group of friends - you won't be sorry you came!
