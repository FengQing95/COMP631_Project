Little Goat Diner////I was very excited to try this place out after eating at The chef's other restaurant. Okie that you can make a reservation now and that the wait is short. It seems very kid and family friendly. My food was good but not as great as I expected. Very disappointed in the vegetarian selections. Overall okay.
