Little Goat Diner////I've been here for brunch several times and finally came to try dinner. So good!! Their brunch items, both sweet and savory, are unique twists on traditional diner staples. Everything I've had, both from the breakfast list and the lunch/dinner list, was terrific. They are also very kid-friendly! If you're going for lunch or dinner, I HIGHLY recommend the sloppy goat. It's delicious!
