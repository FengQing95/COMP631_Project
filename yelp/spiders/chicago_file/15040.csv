Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This place has a name and a lot of hype as a must try. My experience was less than what I had hoped for.  It was about 45 min. wait, they have this thing they say to save time that they half cook the pizza while you wait. I must say it is noticeable when you ate it.The sauce was ok the crust was flaky but seemed it was cooked earlier and reheated.  The cheese not really hot as you would expect. Management got in contact with me after my initial review to see what was the issue.  I have modified my review based on that as I am a firm believer that anyone who try's gets extra points.  I would give it another try.
