Little Goat Diner////Okonomiyaki - 10/10 - Osaka street food with pork belly, scallions, poached egg, kewpie mayo, crunchy tempura & bonito flakes makes such a great savory crepe type dish. This dish is FANTASTIC. The crepe part is very fluffy and moist and packed with flavor. The only weakness is this dish is way TOO SMALL! I could eat 3 of these things.
