Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Made reservations here for my friends birthday for about 8 people 3 weeks in advance and somehow they managed to mess it up. They connected two tables of Â different sizes that can fit a max of 6 people. Also, did I mention they were of different sizes???After talking to the waiter, he changed our seating to an outdoor table. The service was ok, they might have been short staffed that saturday night, because it seemed forever to get the food, a refill, the check. We waited a good half an hour for our check.
