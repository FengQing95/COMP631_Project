Little Goat Diner////I ordered the bulls eye French toast and a cup of goat chili. The Bulls eye has two pieces of French toast made into egg-in-baskets, topped with strawberries and crispy fried chicken pieces. The BBQ maple syrup on the side was interesting but a little off putting to my tastes. Left it out. The goat chili was very good, not overly spicy or heavy.
