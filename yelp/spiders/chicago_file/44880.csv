Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Now it was been raining for a week here and were seated outside which I was excited for until our table was on a rug near the portable kitchen outside for the servers. Note: Wet rugs are worse than wet dogs! So the smell was atrocious. My friend didn't notice so I left it alone and we order almost everything off the menu from goat cheese, to shrimp, pork, steak, chicken and chorizo. Can you say yum!
