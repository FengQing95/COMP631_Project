Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I travel a lot and a eat everywhere I go. I have been to a lot of different amazing spots I've seen on Travel Channel & Food Network and NOTHING has blown my mind the way Lou Malnati's Pizza did. I am a huge pizza lover and this is hands down the greatest pizza known to man! My friends and I were torn between UNO and Lou's. I researched a lot and was leaning toward Lou's then we ran in to some locals and asked their opinion and everyone of them said Lou Malnati. To this day when those of us who were there talk about our trip we still rave about that incredible experience. I had leftovers and STILL bought another pizza to take home with us back to Pennsylvania. I wonder if on my future travels it will ever be topped. Writing this makes me want to jump in my car right now and go to Chicago just to grab a pizza then come home.
