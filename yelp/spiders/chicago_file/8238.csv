Art Institute of Chicago////At my last visit, I spent about an hour with the impressionists and then had to rush through the remaining 1/3 because my time was short. I hiked through the European Art pre 1900s, and eventually made my way to the contemporary galleries in the Modern Wing, but only after taking a break at the Balcony Cafe, which is basically another strategically placed gift shop that serves Intelligentsia coffee in little cups.
