Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is SO FREAKING GOOD and SO FREAKING AFFORDABLE. Everything on the menu is to die - I have yet to have a single thing that didn't make me say "OHMGUDDDD" (that's a mouth full of food 'oh my god'). Their sangria is famous for a reason, their bacon wrapped dates are mouthwatering, and their fun desserts let you try everything just like their entrees! Great spot for a date, casual night out, group outing- legit anything. Can't wait to be back!
