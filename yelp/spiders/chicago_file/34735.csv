Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We chose Bavette's for our annual family holiday dinner and they did not disappoint.  The food, atmosphere and service were right on point.  We arrived at the designated time and were immediately seated.  I was surprised because the restaurant was packed but we always felt that the attention was on us as guests.
