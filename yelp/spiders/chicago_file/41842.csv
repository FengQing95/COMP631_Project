Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've been coming here since I was a newborn- it is a regular haunt for my family whenever we come back to Chicago. This place is fabulous!!! I always order garlic potatoes, which will probably give you a heart attack but they are well worth it. Some things you should also try are the chicken and chorizo, anything with horseradish, and the beef medallions. Go without the goat cheese dip- very typical and it'd be better to try something new. The paella is pretty good too. The only downside is the sangria taps... I would like to think that the bartenders lovingly made my sangria from scratch.
