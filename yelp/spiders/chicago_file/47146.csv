Smoque BBQ////It's a little pricey, but I've never tasted brisket as good as they make here.  The Texas sausage is incredible as is the peach cobbler.  This is one of my favorite places for lunch.  I come here at least once a month.  My challenge is to branch out and try some of the other specialties - the chicken looks really good as does the pulled pork.  Maybe someday...
