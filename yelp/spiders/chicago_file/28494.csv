Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Favorite pizza in Chicago. Would have given it 5 stars but I've had rude encounters with the takeout in Oak Park and have to always ask for condiments. On this particular visit, the woman seemed surprised and annoyed that I asked for them and then only gave me two of each one when we ordered a large deep dish pizza and salad. I also think it's silly that they charge you the price of an additional topping when you request a little extra sauce on top.
