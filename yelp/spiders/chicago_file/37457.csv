Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I've been coming here since I moved to Chicago... and it is the MOST CONSISTENT restaurant I have ever been to. Everything about this place is incredible: the ambiance, the service, the food, the wine, the dessert....I could go on and on. I love this place. Nothing compares. We usually get the petite filet, the bone eye filet, the oysters, and two sides, with dessert...and that's perfect. :)
