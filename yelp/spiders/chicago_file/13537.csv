Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm just a tourist, but this is the best deep dish pizza I have had in Chicago. Actually, it is the best deep dish pizza I have had anywhere. Â We don't have great deep dish in California. The quality of their ingredients and the red ripe tomatoes is comparable to the other three or four places I have been in Chicago, but Lou Malnati's flaky buttery crust is the best.
