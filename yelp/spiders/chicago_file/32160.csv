Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Jesus. Have you seen the wait for one of these places? A weeknight is not the time to be having pizza like this. The wait was well over an hour long. My girl and I got the large pizza loaded with sausage, jalape√±o, and vine ripened tomatoes. The pizza was great. The wait and customer service was not.
