Art Institute of Chicago////Ok, I didnt have a chance to see it all but the location is so convenient.  Just a really short walk from the train station.  I didnt have time for a real tour of the place but the retail store itself is like viewing beautiful art.  I was looking for a coffee table book and purchased one on the history of Chicago style housing.  Plus, being a native, I felt I needed to have something in my home to reflect this fact.  This is one of the largest museum stores I've ever been to with a little something for everyone. I've walked out of museum stores empty handed before but not here!  Since my time was short, I will be back with DH and son in tow!
