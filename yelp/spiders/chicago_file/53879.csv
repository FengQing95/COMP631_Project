Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I can't believe I haven't written a review about this place! So this is the location that introduced me to Tapas. Before that I no clue about what those tasty dishes were. The first time was also for a company event, so you know what that means...loads and loads of food and drinks you dont have to pay for . I digress. Anyway I have been here several times since then. Some standout dishes I love happen to be grilled squid,beef tenderloin and the paella. Their Mojitos were great as well. Cheers to my first Tapas spot!
