Little Goat Diner////I felt like I could've thrown a dart at the menu and loved anything I ordered. However, I chose the Little Piggy Went to China based on Yelp reviews. I was not let down. This dish is jam.packed. with flavor. The biscuit was incredible, and I couldn't stop sopping up the sauce on this dish. My boyfriend had the french toast with chicken and as he was commenting that the dish would be great with a fried egg, he cuts into a piece of the french toast and lo and behold there's an egg baked into it. Amazing.
