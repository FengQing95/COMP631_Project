Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Was quoted 45min wait, but after 30mins I found seating at the bar. After the 30min wait, was told it would be another 45mins for the pizza to arrive! Ordered an appetizer of buffalo wings because I was getting hangry and wow... the wings were AMAZING. I was recommending everyone else at the bar to order some! Extra crispy and the buffalo sauce had the perfect amount of tangy-ness. I had no expectations of how I would like the pizza because I love thin crust, but I was caught off guard at how good it was. A small size was perfect to share between my boyfriend and I. We actually killed the whole pizza. I love that the sausage was like a huge patty so that you could have sausage with every bite. The crust was crispy and cheese was gooey... I'm salivating as I'm writing this review!
