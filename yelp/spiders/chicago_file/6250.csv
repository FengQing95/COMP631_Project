The Purple Pig////This flavor experience may have been the best I've ever had. I enjoyed watching Chef Bannos and his team send out plate after plate - a feast for my eyes. Here's a tip: if you go to the host, you may be told the wait is over an hour...don't worry! All seats around the bar are first come, first serve, and a majority of them were open when we arrived at dinner rush on Monday night. Seat yourself and someone will be right there. We picked the few spots in front of the kitchen, where you can watch the magic happen. Everything was timed flawlessly, so that when we finished one dish, the next came right away. Our server was also EXCELLENT at suggesting wine pairings, just ask! This spot is known for delicious food AND fabulous wine. We started with the Grilled Broccoli, creamy and bright, I am confident these were the best greens I've ever had. Next, the Burrata Di Puglia: after figuring out how to cut into it, this was the most interesting dish I tasted, balancing sweet, salty, creamy, acid, loved it. The Ricotta Gnocchi came next, and it melted in my mouth - as did the Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder. If I had to recommend anything on the menu, it would be this pork shoulder as our whole group couldn't get enough. We didn't have room for dessert, but we ended our night with the blood sausage: I don't see this on the menu anymore at the time I'm writing this but if it comes back I would absolutely recommend as a starter or an ender!
