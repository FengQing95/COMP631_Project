Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I'm so glad this place takes reservations--it can get packed but there is sooooo much seating inside. The sangria is delicious, they offer a traditional red and two different whites. The cheeseboard was pretty good, not too much came out with it. The paella was very flavorful but our rice was a little too crispy. The deviled eggs were also very good--super creamy.
