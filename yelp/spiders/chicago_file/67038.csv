Little Goat Diner////I went here for lunch with a few friends earlier this week.  I had heard that Little goat was diner style so I was actually expecting it to look more drab and old school (you know..like your usual diner establishment) and it was actually very nice and open.  Little goat has high ceilings and big windows to take full advantage of the natural light coming in and they make great use of the space to add as many tables and counter space as they can, but yet it doesn't make the space feel too clustered.  Also we went a little after 12:30 and the wait was not bad at all, we only waited for about ten minutes..which seemed like a mini miracle.
