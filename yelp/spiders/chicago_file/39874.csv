Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Restaurants like this should no longer exist. I was instantly put off by the humorless, overly accommodating, textbook trained staff lunging at us to fulfill the Hogsalt prophecy. "Hello, sir." "Excellent choice, sir." "Well done, sir." This self congratulatory, pube fluffing, Reagan era country club service style must die. The servers are posers, the clients play the part, and the bill is sky high at the end. My first real issue with Bavettes was them not brining out bread when we sat down at the table. It's standard practice there that only after you order is a basket of starch thrown down on the table. The onslaught of contrived, scripted, Remains of the Day pathetic servitude continued until our entrees were served in tandem with the appetizers. My steak frites (medium well) was lackluster - so much so that I only ate a few bites. Typically, I'm a member of the Clean Plate Club. For some reason, it came out pre sliced by the kitchen in overly thick cuts that allowed all the heat to escape. I don't know why they did this. In our party of six, I was able to sample a sizeable cross section of the menu - butter bombs all. Butter mushrooms, butter broccoli, butter brussel sprouts, butter steak. Also, I'm a fry boy. I consistently slam fries. Only made it through half of the Lowry seasoning salt and lard sodden potato slices before abandoning ship like the USS Indianapolis. The table to our left consisted of a group of pilled out 50 somethings - totally thwapped on anti depressants and overpriced seafood. To our right, a never ending cavalcade of waifish thots taking a break from serving their soulless corporate masters. The vibes were cold and off-putting. When the bill mercifully arrived (if it was more than $177 bucks - which it absolutely was - it would be highway robbery), I slugged the rest of my Coors Original and dismissed myself. Restaurants like these actually do serve a purpose- to highlight the gulf between food made with love, and those fleecing and suckering yuppies.
