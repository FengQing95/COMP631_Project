Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ba-Ba is always a good time! You really can't go wrong when you come here, but my only suggestion would be the more, the merrier. If you go here by yourself, you limit how many fantastic dishes you can try! I'm not usually big on fruity drinks either, but their sangria is definitely the way to go! Stick to the original house red sangria for a nice treat; not too sweet and just the right amount of buzz to get you going to really elevate those tapas!
