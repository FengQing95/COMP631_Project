Little Goat Diner////This place is fantastic. We've been here about 10 times for brunch. Great atmosphere. We always bring our out of town guests. And they are super kid friendly which was really unexpected. We have little ones and finding babysitters for brunch is not an option. Nice to know you can bring them along.
