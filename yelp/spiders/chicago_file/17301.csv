Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////After about 20 minutes we got the cheese bread, and the salad.  I am not a salad person, so I can't really comment on the taste, but I did have a bite.  the salami bits are very crunchy, and add a flavor I didn't enjoy.  I would have enjoyed the salad without that addition.  The cheese bread is very good.  There is a good blend of cheese, with a decent flavor of garlic.  The edges of the loaf were fairly crispy with the portion under the cheese being relatively chewy but not undercooked.
