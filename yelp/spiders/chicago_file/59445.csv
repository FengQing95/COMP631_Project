Smoque BBQ////on to the meat: my brisket was good. I wouldn't say amazing. It had a really good smoked flavor, even without the sauce. The meat was cooked well... but the sauce really added to the flavor. I believe they had a north carolina sauce for the brisket which had a great balance of sweetness but wasn't too tart, and didn't overwhelm the flavor of the brisket. I'd say for me it was more than above average for sure, but no grand slam however.
