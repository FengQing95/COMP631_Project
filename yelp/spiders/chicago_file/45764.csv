Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Overall, fun and great dining experience. The waiter we had was very attentive and helpful with dish selections. The runners and bussers do an amazing job keeping the food coming and clearing away your plates as the small tables can get kind of crowded. This place is really noisy because there's so much going on, but it just adds to the experience.
