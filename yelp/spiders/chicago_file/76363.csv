Little Goat Diner////I ordered the Patty Melt and what was their "Dr. Pepper", called a pepper elixir (it tasted like Dr. Pepper with a cough syrup aftertaste). I was a little disturbed that everything was served "a la carte", which for me, meant I only got a patty melt for $13 dollars and that didn't include a side of any kind. Had to order that separate.
