Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been to this restaurant a dozen times - the food has been consistently good every time.  We always order our favorite stand bys: the spicy potatoes, bacon wrapped dates, goat cheese and marinara and red sangria.  Then we try to mix it up with a few other dishes.  This last time we tried the deviled eggs (good), cheese plate (very good), garlic shrimp (excellent), and some others I'm failing to remember.
