Art Institute of Chicago////I'm visiting Chicago from Los Angeles for a conference, and decided to check out the AIC while here. I must say I was seriously impressed. Even with the Getty and LACMA in LA, the Art Institute had some really heavy hitters when it came to their impressionist and surrealist collections (which are my favorite forms of art). The Monets, Manets, Van Goughs, and Cezannes were gorgeous to see in person, and I was impressed to see the self portrait of Van Gough in such a place. But throw in your Degas, Dali, and Pollack and in you're in an impressionist-surrealist-modern heaven.
