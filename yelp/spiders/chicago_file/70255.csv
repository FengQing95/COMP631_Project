Little Goat Diner////Love. Love. Love. I had heard this place was great for kids and it was! We took my son here for his 2nd birthday and the service and food were impeccable. Â Our server seated my in laws and my son's godparents while we were on the way. We had reservations too - very easy to make. It was on a Sunday but still packed. Love the casual feel but everyone there looked like they were to have fun. They have valet but we took a spot through a lot close by. When we arrived they had a high chair ready for us and water was already on the table. Our server greeted us promptly and got in our drink orders. When he came back with our drinks, we ordered the entrees. I got a chocolate malt shake (duh, amazing - and so much whipped cream, how it should be!), and the mushroom ragout. My son got a side of Mac and cheese, my husband got the Reuben sandwich, my mother in law got the chicken pot pie. I don't remember what everyone else got though - but I know for sure there wasn't much left! At the end the server got us a little ice cream sundae for my son to sing happy birthday, which totally made his day. Pricing wasn't terrible - the food was delicious and my son was happy. I would definitely come here again, especially so I can try out the cocktails next time! What I super appreciated was our server's patience and quickness - my son was having a temper tantrum and he got him some goat stickers, made sure he was happy (as well as the rest of our table). He's the one that really made it worth our while to come here, and I've been really looking forward to visiting this place, so thanks to that server who made my son's birthday so great!
