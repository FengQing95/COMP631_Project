Smoque BBQ////Before coming to Smoque I heard epic tales of its succulent greatness. I'll be honest after trying it I am not that impressed. Perhaps it is because I am from Texas where BBQ is king or I think that when you throw down $10 you should be given more food than you can eat, but Smoque did not satisfy my expectations.
