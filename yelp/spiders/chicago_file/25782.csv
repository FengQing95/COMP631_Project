Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////It was the first time trying the famous Chicago deep dish pizza and I was really really skeptical. We ordered half with sausage and the other half regular cheese and..... it was very good! I would never thought I could like a pizza like that one but it was a very successful experience! The only thing I didn't really enjoy was the crust which tasted a little bit weird and it was really hard to cut. Besides that, it was good!
