Little Goat Diner////She may have to be named the Golden  Girl & the Goat. Everything Izard seems to put her name on turns out to be spectacular. This being said, the diner has not even opened yet!!  Had the egg salad sandwich & the tomatoe apple soup. Ok, sounds classic enough, nothing too fancy...flavors bursting in your mouth. Go...don't make any excuses & just go! The decor is phenomenal too. She is truly making a brand for herself & Chicago is embracing it!!
