Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We love this deep dish, better than Ginos! They deliver in a timely fashion. About an hour for a large deep dish. Order it uncut, so it doesnt get messy when they are delivering. We had that happen once, where all the toppings and cheese slid off. We called them and they sent us a coupon for a free pizza. We also like the mozzarella sticks and the beef sandwiches. We get it delivered at least once a week.
