Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The food here is excellent, I enjoyed myself very much. However I am forced to give such a low overall score because of their "gluten free" menu. A Â dear friend of mine has celiac's disease, and therefore ingesting gluten makes her extremely ill. Three of us went to dinner here and chose to all order off the gluten free menu so that we could share everything we ordered. As a person who understands the nature of food allergies and food related diseases fairly well, I know that there is a lot of risk in ordering from a restaurant, even if they do claim to have a gluten free menu, however, I wish that restaurants would take more care with food that is being served to people specifically ordering off of any special menu, because my poor friend was sick before we even got home. Excellent, upbeat atmosphere, good service, and great tasting food. Unfortunately this one experience for me has tainted my vision of this place, and I warn others who might order of their gluten free menu to be extra cautious...
