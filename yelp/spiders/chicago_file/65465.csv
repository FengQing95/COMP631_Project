Smoque BBQ////I'm from St. Louis, and I was quite skeptical about getting BBQ in Chicago, but I was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was at Smoque! They have really good BBQ, very good portions, and the prices aren't bad. I got a half slab of STL ribs with mac n cheese, fries, and coleslaw for an early dinner on Saturday. We had about a 30 minute wait in the line to order, and then a 15 minute wait for our food. It was surprising that the food took so long to arrive, but the food was fresh and hot when our names were finally called. My cousin and her friend both ordered the double meat brisket and pulled pork sandwiches, and it was a ton of meat. All of us enjoyed our food and were pleasantly surprised by how good the coleslaw was. It has really good flavor and is not your typical coleslaw. The watermelon iced tea and sweet tea are also winners!
