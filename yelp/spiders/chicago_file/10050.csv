Art Institute of Chicago////The Art Institute of Chicago is hands-down one of the best museums in Chicago. Beautiful works of art and gorgeous architecture. I have a membership and it's more than worth it--my monthly visits combined with free coat check and access to the Member's Lounge more than compensate for the $100 price tag. Plus I can bring 2 guests each visit! An awesome attraction for out-of-town guests!
