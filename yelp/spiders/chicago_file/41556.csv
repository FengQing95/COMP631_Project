Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We came on a warm sunny afternoon and sat outside, so we can't remark much on the decor, other than that you should definitely try to eat outside if you can. Â Not only is it a wonderful way to enjoy the food, you become surrounded by the smells of the foods of other patrons and leads to quite an appetite opening atmosphere.
