Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visiting from Los Angeles, I was really looking forward to a "Chicago Style" deep dish pizza. This was our first time to Chicago and we found this place by searching online and reading reviews here on Yelp. Wow, is about the only adjective I can use to describe the deep dish deliciousness that we received here. We sat at the bar area and chatted it up with the bartenders and tried to absorb the whole Chicago pizza experience.
