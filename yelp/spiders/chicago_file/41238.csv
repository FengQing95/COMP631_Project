Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I've loved this place for a long time. Service is pretty solid, and it's a lively space. The food is consistent, and while everything I've tried is good, there are several must-haves. I love the escargot, spicy potatoes, and the bacon wrapped dates. Great cheese plates, and good sangria. Purists may tell you these dishes aren't authentic Spanish tapas, but if they taste this good, then who cares? More escargots, please!
