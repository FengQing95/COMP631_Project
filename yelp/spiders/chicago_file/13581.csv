Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou's has had this version of the gluten free pizza for a while now, and back when they started serving it there was much less known about the food chemistry of how to make a gluten-free crust, and certainly fewer suppliers of quality ingredients. Times have changed though, and several companies are now serving excellent gluten free pizza that is indistinguishable from the rest. Lou's needs to revisit this offering and bring it up to date. if you're with someone who HAS to have Lou Malnati's, the personal pizza is a viable part of a larger meal. But don't go out of your way to try it.
