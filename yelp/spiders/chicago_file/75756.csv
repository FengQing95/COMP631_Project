Little Goat Diner////The only thing I can say about this place is that it is very unique to try once if you're visiting from out of town, but if I was from Chicago or lived in the area, I honestly probably wouldn't frequent the place. Little Goat is essentially a diner with a menu not expected of a diner which is really cool and interesting, but at the end of the day, it's diner food: greasy, probably not the healthiest, but without the great prices of a regular diner.
