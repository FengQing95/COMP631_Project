Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Visited the restaurant with the family since we were near Michigan Ave.  Food is so so.  Don't get what so special about  "The Malnati Chicago Classic". It's just a pizza.  It was SO LOUD!!! in the restaurant too.  And we waited about 1 hour for it  (though we toured the area while waiting).  The only re-deeming part was the local craft beer I tasted that was unique.
