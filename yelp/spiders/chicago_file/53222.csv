Smoque BBQ////We settled on the baby back ribs (the St. Louis ribs weren't available that night) with BBQ beans and mac and cheese for the sides, and added the sampler portion of the sliced brisket. Even though it seemed every inch of the place was full, we were led to an empty section of the table immediately after ordering.
