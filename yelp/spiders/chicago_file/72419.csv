Little Goat Diner////I ordered the Crab and Shrimp dip and the fish tostadas. Let me just preface: Whenever I get a dip, I always assume there are a million calories so I try to settle for a little taste while my other half finishes the rest. Well...my other half wasn't in the mood for seafood and my will power wasn't on point so I ended up finishing the phenomenal crab dip until the dish was empty-it was that good!
