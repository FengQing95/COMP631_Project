Little Goat Diner////Story:  Barista didn't notice "soymilk" on my order so made a mocha out of skim milk... I'm lactose-intolerant.  I didn't realize it contained milk until I drove away.  Left a vm with Little Goat's office.  Samantha called a couple days later and apologized profusely.  Refunded the cost of my mocha and emailed me with more apologies.
