Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////A truly special place! We had dinner here for the bf's birthday. I got us an 8 pm reservation nearly two months earlier. We showed up about ten minutes early and were able to grab a drink at the bar while we waited. The ambiance is really perfect- dark, swanky but not pretentious at all. The majority of the women were in sundresses and lots of men were wearing dark jeans. My French martini was perfect-- the sickeningly sweet raspberry liqueur you sometimes find in this drink was nowhere to be found.
