Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The pizza at this restaurant was nothing short of delicious. We ordered the small pizza for two people to share and it was more than enough. We could not find room to finish it all. The waitstaff was super friendly and helpful. I'm glad that we went here, it did not disappoint!
