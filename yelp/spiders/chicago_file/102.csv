Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Anyway. My omelette was...okay. there was nothing about it that I thought deserved the month-long build up. I thought it was kind of bland and nothing special. I tried the skillet and, again, thought it was only okay. It was gigantic but also kind of bland... The skillet roommate had gotten that dish before so she had to like something about it and the pancake roommate said the pancakes were "amazing!" So maybe Wildberry's niche is their sweet dishes?
