Art Institute of Chicago////The Modern Wing.....even if you're not a fan of modern art--and I admit I'm one of those people who looks at blobs of paint on a huge canvas and says "i coulda done that" --this is something you have to experience. Take the bridge from Millenium Park--magnificent --amazing views of the park and lake, great vantage point to shoot pics--arrive at the third floor-and just let the building happen to you. Even the views from the escalator are stupendous. I haven't seen much of the galleries yet, it was an architectural mission. Breathtaking.
