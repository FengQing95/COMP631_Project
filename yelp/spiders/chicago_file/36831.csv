Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The service was excellent and the food was just as good: I had a dozen oysters and the steak frites plus we drank a few bottles of red at the table. They were easily able to accommodate my Celiac with every course except dessert. Our server was very knowledgable about gluten free diets and had no problem steering me in the right direction.
