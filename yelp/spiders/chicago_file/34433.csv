Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I went here for my birthday. The ambiance was amazing, like a speakeasy. They have an awesome byob(wine) policy! Now for the important stuff the food! The dry aged 22oz ribeye was amazing! I went to David burkes a few weeks prior and Bavettes ribeye knocks them out of the water! Perfectly cooked, medium rare with a beautiful crust! Also the mashed potatoes were great! This place is a must!
