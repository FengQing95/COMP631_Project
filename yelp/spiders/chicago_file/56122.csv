Smoque BBQ////I got the taste portions of the pork, sliced brisket, and a texas sausage with a side of the beans (which were the most interesting to me on the TV spot) and a cornbread muffin. I've never had better meats and the sauces tasted good although I didn't want to mess up the flavor of the meat so I went mostly dry. The sausage wasn't as spicy of a link as I prefer, but the perfect smoke flavor more than made up for that.
