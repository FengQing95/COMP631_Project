Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The tapas appetizers here are very good. Lots of flavor, lots of character. We got the patatas bravas with the spicy dipping sauce, the brussel sprout salad, the braised short rib, and two free desserts with yelp check in - the flan and the chocolate dessert. We also got the mango sangria which was tasty.
