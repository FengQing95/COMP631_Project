Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Me and my husband had a great experience the food was awesome and the service was great. Our server was very nice but what made our night memorable was the bus boy Miguel he was great had great feed back on the food and what to try since it was my first time here. He was so nice and really made us feel at home! Thank you Miguel!!
