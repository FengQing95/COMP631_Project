Little Goat Diner////But here's the thing. The waits are ridiculous. And while I initially thought that was simply due to popularity, after eating here I learned that it is just as much a result of ridiculous pacing (LONG break between appetizers and entrees and and again before dessert) and slow, slow service. We got our fries when we had about a bite left in our burgers, and my shake had melted to the point of being a really cold glass of chocolate milk by the time it was delivered.
