Art Institute of Chicago////I came here for the last part of a daylong Chicago museum trip -- my bf and I also went to Shedd and Field. I was getting a bit tired by the third museum, so I probably didn't enjoy the museum as much as I would've if we came here first, so my rating could be a little skewed.
