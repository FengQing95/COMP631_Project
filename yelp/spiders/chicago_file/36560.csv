Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I'll start with the service. First of all, they do not seat people unless your entire party is here. Not really a pro or a con in my opinion, but just something to be aware of if you're dining with a large party. Anyway, we were seated promptly once everyone had arrived. We got one of those nice round booths, which are VERY comfy and made me real sleepy and content after a steak, superb sides, and a glass of syrah. Our waiter (forgot his name) was attentive (but not overbearing) and friendly. He had great recommendations and helped us order the right amount of food for our group of 4.
