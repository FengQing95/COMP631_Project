Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////First of all, the food here is awesome. I've had the Chicago cut ribeye and the bone in ribeye - both perfectly cooked and some of the best steaks I've had in Chicago. I prefer the bone-in personally as it was a little juicier. Mashed potatoes with garlic were full of flavor as was the corn elote. Fried chicken was good, not the best I've ever had. I think it was over seasoned and the crust a little too hard. That being said, the food is consistently good.
