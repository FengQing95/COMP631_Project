Art Institute of Chicago////So here's a cool little tip for those Bank of America customers: check with them to see if they're having a special sale for BOA customers because I got my admission ticket for free when I went because I had BOA. Usually an adult ticket costs $18, and when I was handing over my credit card, the cashier mentioned BOA members got in free. Woot woot!
