Smoque BBQ////Out of all of the restaurants I researched before coming to Chicago, Smoque's stood at the top of the list for nearly every website I came across. Needless to say, I don't think it was the BEST BBQ I've ever had in my life, but it was definitely good. The line for this place can go out of the door during peak times so I would suggest getting there a little earlier. The cool thing about this place (and other places in Chicago) is that it's BYOB. Had I known that, I would've gone to the liquor store to grab some drinks beforehand.
