Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Very good chicago steak house. All the usual things done well including service. Â The sides are large and meant to be shared. I would suggest you do the same with dessert- if you make it that far. Come with a large appetite and an open wallet. The cost prevents me from giving it 5 stars. After all, it's just steak. If I could get the same meat they do I could cook it just as well on my grill. It's a very good steak house, enough said.
