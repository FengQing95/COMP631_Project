Smoque BBQ////I had heard great things and been wanting to try this place for some time... So glad I did! We went just a few days ago on 3/25/11 and had a wonderful experience. The place was packed, but they have a great form of organization down. The young woman at the register was super friendly and helpful with us first-timers. I chose the sliced brisket, and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD! Best brisket I'd ever had. The coleslaw comes with pretty much everything, and it's good. I liked the baked beans, but they weren't the best I'd ever had. But let me tell you, the macaroni and cheese is the way to go! My boyfriend had the St. Louis style ribs, and they were amazing, too - he loved them. He also enjoyed the corn bread. I feel like you can't really go wrong at Smoque! I can't wait to go back, and I'd like to introduce some out-of-towners to the place sometime.
