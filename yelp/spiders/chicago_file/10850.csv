Art Institute of Chicago////I can spend eternity here gazing upon the brilliant pieces of work mankind has lovingly and painstakingly created. This place is endless and requires a full day or a couple of days to properly take in. It's by far, my favorite art institution I've been to. It, most definitely, tops the Getty Villa in Malibu, California. The refugee portion that recently opened up offers a sea of information about the hardships and suffering immigrants are forced to endure while fleeing turmoil in what was once a safe place called home. The short stories displayed starkly in the tent were absolutely profound. It reminded me of the perseverance and strength humans have, to endure absolutely any unspeakable tragedy/ tragedies while armed with little more than hope and faith, helping them begin a new life after the storm of suffering. Once all their fears become a reality, they become fearless and strong beyond belief. Their stories ignite a respect and admiration from those who have never been in their position and are now able to empathize with the refugee crisis. As I was taking in the work, I encountered a very rude employee. I didn't think much of it until the employee disrespected an elderly couple. I spoke to the manager and she was apologetic and kind. She let me know that she would talk to that employee and make sure he was respectful and didn't enforce rules that didn't exist instead focusing on the ones that did. I appreciated their swiftness in handling the situation. I spent hours in this portion of the museum before I wandered into another world of art featuring Islamic artifacts and textiles. Each place I visited was mind blowing. Before long, as I admired the armor in the medieval section, my stomach rumbled with hunger. The only thing that could get in the way of immersing myself in the beauty of it all was hunger. Therefore, I vow to come back and continue discovering exceptional work for hours on end with a full stomach.
