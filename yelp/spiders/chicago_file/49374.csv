Smoque BBQ////Service was friendly and as fast as could be for the line that was there at 2 on a Sat afternoon.  I like that they request you order before snatching a table since it helps make sure the flow of tables works.  Also, we overheard one of the workers advising someone on the phone to call ahead if coming late at night to make sure they still have what you want.  Keep in mind, brisket and pulled pork take a long time to make (as in overnight), so its not just something that they can whip up more of.
