The Purple Pig////Having lived near Chicago I've been hearing about this place for a while. Came maybe ~10 minutes right before they opened for lunch on a Sunday so we were the second ones seated right at 11:30. The food was good but it's definitely overhyped. We ordered a gnocchi , chicken kebab, meat platter, bone marrow, and a pork dish. By the end the 4 of us were all stuffed and struggling to finish the last dish. I noticed that a lot of reviews recommend the bone marrow. You scoop it up and spread it onto bread with some other toppings. It was pretty good but not as good as I was expecting from all the hype. It just tastes like butter.
