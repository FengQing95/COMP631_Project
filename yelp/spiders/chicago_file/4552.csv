The Purple Pig////I got lucky and was able to get seated at the bar right in front of the kitchen where all the magic happens.  Being able to watch the team put the flavorful plates together was an added bonus to my experience. Voted one of  America's best restaurants in 2010 the Purple Pig exceeded my expectations.
