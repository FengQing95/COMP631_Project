Art Institute of Chicago////Anyways, amazing art museum.  Many great pieces on display.... Hopper's "Nighthawks" (although it was part of a pay exhibit at the time), Wood's "American Gothic", over 30 Monets, Seurat's "Sunday Afternoon" and many other masterpieces.  The staff was very knowledgeable and friendly.  Gift shop was overpriced but what museum gift shop isn't?  Do not miss the Art Institute if you are in Chicago.
