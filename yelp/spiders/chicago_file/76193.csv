Little Goat Diner////My husband ordered the Bulls Eye French Toast. The presentation to this was cute. You got two pieces of sweet onion brioche with the middle caved in each having an egg in it, then covered by some chicken and drenched in a BBQ maple syrup. The dish itself was tasty, however the chicken was somewhat dry.
