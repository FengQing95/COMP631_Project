Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Walked into the place on time and was seated immediately. Our jackets were taken which was good. The place has a nice vibe about it. You feel really relaxed in here. Must be a combination of the Jazz music and the best Manhattan I have ever had caressing my lips. Wow, can they make a drink. Our party of 4 started off with a dozen oysters mixed between east and west coast. I would always get east coast Maine oysters if it were up to me. West coasters just make me think of Fukushima. East Coasters were perfect and served with horseradish as I like it. They have good bread and butter here too which is important. We got an order of the thick cut bacon and that was really good. I saved some of that to mix with my mashed potatoes. Bacon and mash go real good together. For the Main course, I went with the Daddy of them all, the bone in ribeye. I honestly don't think I have had a better cut of meat. I like my steak medium and at medium you still didn't have to cut the meat at all. The knife just went right through the meat. I was in food and drink lovers heaven. I had a couple of manhattans and a Lagunitas Sumpin Sumpin after dinner. It really was top notch. I want to get back here soon. Their desserts look really good but I always fill myself up and don't get the chance to try them. So glad to have discovered this place.
