Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Another word on service.  The staff member brought our steaks (about 5-7 min after ordered) before we were even given the promised bread service.  Super odd.  Even more odd was that the person delivering the steaks placed them in front of the wrong people.  When we told her that she did not have them in the proper place, she did not really care and told us to cut into them with her there to see if they were cooked properly (all ordered differently).  When the server finally did show up, he felt two of our steaks were overcooked (they were!) and did offer to take them back.  I feel very uncomfortable sending food back to the kitchen.  I also feel uncomfortable with the fact that the steaks were overcooked at a steak restaurant and that at this price point, the staff did not know which dish went to which person.  The steak was average for a high end Chicago steakhouse.
