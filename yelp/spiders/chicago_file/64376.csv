Smoque BBQ////Let's start with the brisket. Taste really good.  Bark pretty good.  Smoke ring really couldn't tell the was much of one.  Texture of the meat wad lacking a little bit as well as the color.  Perusal this was really good tasting brisket.  Some of the best I have had outside of Texas.  That is saying a lot coming from a bbq snob like myself.
