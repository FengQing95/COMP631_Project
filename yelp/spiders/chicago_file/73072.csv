Little Goat Diner////Before I went I perused the menu and knew I wanted to try the Crumpets with Chorizo Maple Syrup. Words cannot even express how good they were! I've never had a Crumpet before and my British coworkers had explained to me how good they were. I was psyched to see it on the menu as I'm going to London in 5 weeks and thought it would be good preparation! The crumpet was so soft and gooey which I love in my baked goods. None of that crunchy, overbaked grossness. The maple syrup...ahhhhhh the maple syrup. What a perfect pairing with the chorizo which had but a dash of heat to it. I was very happy that it wasn't overly spiced and just an delicious and simple, yet inventive, dish. I'm pleased to report it was a huge portion and with all our sides I was able to eat one crumpet while at the diner, one crumpet for dinner that night and one for breakfast this morning. Yep, it made me three meals out of this amazing $11 dish.
