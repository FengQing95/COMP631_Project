Little Goat Diner////We waited in the adjacent coffee extension next door and loved the fact that I could see what was going inside the bakery/kitchen through the window. My girlfriend and I are fiends for intelligensia coffee so we enjoyed ourselves at the bar sipping on coffee. We wanted something savory but apparently by 2:30 they were all out of salty stuff at the bakery.
