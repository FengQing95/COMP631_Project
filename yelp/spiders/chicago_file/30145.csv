Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Waited an hour and a half to get a table and another 45mins to get our food (the food are made to order). Was it worth it? Yes! I ordered deep dish cheese pizza with sausage, pepperoni and jalape√±o toppings. The crust was to die for! Crispy and buttery. Also ordered sangria to pair with my pizza.
