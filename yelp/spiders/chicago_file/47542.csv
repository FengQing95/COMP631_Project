Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Great ambiance and decoration, but the food wasn't as great as it used to. I ordered an octopus with potatoes that was supposed to be grilled but it was burnt. I told the waiter that the dish tasted like charcoal and he changes the dish. The octopus was better but the potatoes were burnt, not-edible burnt. I told the waiter and he said that some people liked it  like this but he could take it off the bill if I wanted. I responded that it wasn't about the bill but about the quality of the food. He said he was sorry but the dish was like that.  Even though the decoration is great, if the food isn't, it's not worth it.
