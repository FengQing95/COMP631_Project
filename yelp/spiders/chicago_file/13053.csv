Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////BUSY BUSY BUSY - first dinner I had in Chicago - great calamari - and decent pizza (I'm more of an NYC style fan myself - sue me...). Server didn't give much attention to the table - but that's understandable considering how quickly they were turning tables. If you're looking for that true Chicago pizzeria experience this is definitely worth going out of your way for!
