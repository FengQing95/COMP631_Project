Smoque BBQ////Ribs: holy moly these were delicious. When people write reviews saying this was the best bbq place in Chicago for ribs, couldn't agree more! The ribs were well cooked and the meat on them was delicious!!!! There wasn't any fat it was all big juicy meats on the ribs. Incredible, it really was. The sauce BLEW MY MIND!!! they gave us two cups of the sauce and we finished both, craving more. The sauce was so good I could honestly eat it plain which is totally nasty but feels totally right.
