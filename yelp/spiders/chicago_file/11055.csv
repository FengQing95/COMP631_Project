Art Institute of Chicago////I had a day to explore by myself so I thought, what better than checking out one of Chicago's most famous museums?! Tickets were super easy to purchase at the door - $25 a person. I wore my Nike's because I knew there would be a lot of walking (15K steps) but I didn't think I wouldn't be able to make it through all the exhibits!
