Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I love that there is another brunch spot option in the loop. Some days you just crave breakfast for lunch. It is unfortunate that  you aren't able to make reservations, but it kind of seems to be the norm for breakfast. I have been on enough waiting lists to make it a point to go earlier or a time when it is less busy. We did leave the office a little earlier to try to beat the lunch time rush on Friday, and the wait was probably 5 minutes for the first available table.  It was a perfect day to eat outside, with the slight breeze from the lake.  I got Blackened Chicken Sandwich with sweet potato fries.  it hit the spot for me and was the right portion.  The prices were reasonable and our server was friendly.  I'm sure when a breakfast meal craving comes on the next time, I'll be jumping at the opportunity to come back here.
