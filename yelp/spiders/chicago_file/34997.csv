Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We moved on to a shrimp cocktail for starters, which is (I believe) exactly the same as the offering at Maude's - a good thing. The shrimp were perfect, and the presentation was wonderful. However, we had shellfish tower envy of the tables around us, so we definitely need to try that on a future visit.
