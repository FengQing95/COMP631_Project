Little Goat Diner////I went there for the first time for lunch and tried their blue plate.  It was salmon tacos.  If you know anything about me, I'd rather have savory versus sweet.  The dish had a combination of both but I wasn't going insane over the dish.  And trust me, there have been moments where I've experienced a near food orgasm but not here.  It was just good.
