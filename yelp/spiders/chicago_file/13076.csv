Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////There is a big difference between New York pizza and Chicago pizza.  Being a New Yorker, a pizza is a to go food, something you fold, thin crust, good proportion of tomato sauce and cheese.  So when I had to try a deep dish, I wanted to try one of the best and this comes highly recommended.  My friend and I called ahead to see how long the wait was, which was 45 mins, we decided to just order take out and eat it at the Navy Pier.  (Shouldn't there be a rule, we don't have to wait for pizza? Just saying!). Upon arriving, the line was out the door for a table.  There method of trying to control the length you sit, order your pizza while you wait for the table and pay at the counter.  It takes a long time to cook these massive pizzas and thankfully we ordered out and called ahead.  The pizza came in a convenient box, and we shared a tiny 6 inch pizza.  The pizza didn't make it to navy pier... I wanted to just eat it now!  Excuse me cab driver, do you mind if I eat this in your backseat?  It was tasty.  Thick crust with tons of cheese in every bite.  The sauce wasn't the greatest but I can see the attraction.  The pizza is good but I like my thin crust.  If I had to wait for a table, I would've been upset.  Wish the sauce was more flavorful and the cheese wasn't so overwhelming.  And there you have it, my first experience of deep dish pizza was in the back seat of a cab... And I don't regret that choice at all.
