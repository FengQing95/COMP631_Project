Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So so disappointed. I really wanted to love this place, and deep dish pizza in general. There was a long line out the front and inside for a table on. Saturday evening. We were told the wait would be 45 mins but it was only about 20 before we were seated upstairs. We order a Malnati special pizza (medium) which is suited for 3 people according to the menu.
