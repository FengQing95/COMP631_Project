Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The restaurant is large and had some nice mood lighting which I appreciated. Service was just ok. Even though our server managed to have the tapas spaced appropriately he did forget a few dishes and a couple of us had to remind him about drinks we ordered. He was lacking a personality. I've noticed over the years that many LEYE restaurants have delicious food but noticeably sullen, robotic or easily agitated servers. Â It's one of the greatest mysteries of the modern world. All in all though, this fun place is still worth a visit. xoxo
