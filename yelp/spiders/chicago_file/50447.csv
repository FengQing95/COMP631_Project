Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Not from Chicago, but got recommended to come to this place! First we ordered black raspberry sangria, delicious!!! Not too sweet and also not loaded with liquor. We ordered the heirloom tomato salad, meat charcuterie and chicken empanadas. The heirloom salad sounds a lot more fancy than what it was. It was 3 huge pieces of lettuce with 2 big pieces of tomato and then some green dressing. The cucumbers and onions in it looked old and dried out (9 dollars). The charcuterie was terrible. The only good thing we're the side cup of olives. The meats had funky flavors, the bruschetta was on hard stale bread and not appetizing. The cheese was not good and only came with 3 tiny thin slices. (20 dollars!!!). The chicken empanada only came with one, it was the better of the three. (6.50). Overall, I was not happy with my experience. If the sangria was bad, this place would have gotten 1 star.
