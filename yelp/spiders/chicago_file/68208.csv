Little Goat Diner////For a girl who loves breakfast at any hour of the day, Little Goat was the spot for me. While their burgers, chicken fingers, and mac n' cheese are all amazing in their own right, I have to order the Fat Elvis Waffles every time I visit this restaurant, which has an upscale but welcoming diner feel.  Not a waffle fan? Just ask for this dish with pancakes instead.  The combination of bananas, bacon maple syrup, and peanut butter-butter (yes that's a thing) will having you dreaming of your meal for days and dying to make a return trip.
