Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I made a reservation here for mine and my wife's 20th anniversary based upon a recommendation from a Chicago raised work mate in Los Angeles. The best I could do was a 4:15pm because apparently, everyone else wants to eat here as well. At it's heart, it's an old world steakhouse, but the thing that you'll figure out pretty quickly is that old world doesn't mean typical. We were instantly greeted by our server Barbara who set a tone of "no rush" by inviting us to settle in before we made any decisions on drinks or food. Our experience from then on was one "best ever" after another. The steak tartare is simply to die for. My wife was worried when it was served that she would fill up on the incredible bread it's served with. Barbara picked up on this and had one of her assistants bring out some of their insanely good chips to have as an alternative. This is the level of detail we experienced in service and quality of food throughout the meal. This restaurant does not leave any detail to chance and it shows in every single course. I cannot possibly recommend this restaurant highly enough if you're looking for a classic, detail oriented steakhouse in Chicago. I cannot wait for our next trip.
