Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Honestly perfect. Tiny bites of a bunch of things is exactly what you wanted and they're all delicious. It's always packed for a reason. They have like 5 sangrias on tap?! Yeah it's pretty magical. They also host amazing wine tasting events with some of the best party bites around and tons of wine at pretty reasonable prices. We go as often as possible.
