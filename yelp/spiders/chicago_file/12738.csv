Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The ONLY place for authentic Chicago pizza.  The sauce is a perfect combination of sweet and tart  and they put an inch thick layer of sausage on the whole pizza!  Outside of the order delay (30-60 min) this place is the ultimate example of a Chicago food staple.  DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ELSEWHERE!!!
