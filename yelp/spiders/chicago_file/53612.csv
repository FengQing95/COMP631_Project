Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We rolled in late on a Sunday (before President's Day) with about 20 minutes left until the kitchen closed. We were starving and trying hard to find a place we could quick eat before they closed. Trying to be good patrons (and attempting for servers not to hate us for coming in so late), we ordered as soon as we sat down: Burrata (#23), shrimp w garlic (#44), short rib (#51), and bacon wrapped dates (#67).
