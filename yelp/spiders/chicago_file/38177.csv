Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Service was stellar. The waiter was very knowledgeable and helpful. He tactfully dissuaded us from a few choices and offered a few of his personal favorites that were deemed unsung. He checked on us frequently but not so much that you felt he was rushing you to order and free up the table. Kudos to him because there's a fine line between attentive and impatient.
