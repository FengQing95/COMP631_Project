Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////Went for the first time last Thursday and today was my second visit in less than a week.  The food is pretty good much better than most of the breakfast selections in the area.  I had the Fresca Omelette on my first visit.  It came with hash browns which were just okay.  I only ate a very small portion of them.  The omelette on the other hand was quite delicious! It was huge too.  I was only able to eat half of it.  Today, I had the Tuscan Chicken Panini on Sun-Dried Tomato Focaccia instead of the Italian Ciabatta w/sweet potato fries.  Again, the portion size was HUGE! I managed to eat 1/2 the sandwich and maybe 1/2 cup of the fries. The sandwich was really good.  I'd definitely order it again.  The fries were ok but that may be because I had my meal to go.  I can't comment on the service of the waitstaff because I have yet to dine in but based on the quality and quantity of food, I'll be going back in the near future.  Oh, I do have one complaint, I have now way of knowing the calorie count of the food.  It's kinda hard trying to figure it out but I do the best I can.
