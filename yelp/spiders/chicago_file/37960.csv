Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Everything was great. The shrimp cocktail was fresh and came with a number of different sauces. We got two crab cakes - a great decision as it was too good to be satisfied with one. Our sides included wild mushrooms, Brussels sprouts and fries with garlic aioli (some of the best damn fries out there). For the main course, I went with the dry aged bone in rib eye. It was delicious, but given the apps and sides that preceded the main course, I couldn't finish the whole thing.
