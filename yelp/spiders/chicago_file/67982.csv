Little Goat Diner////The food was very flavorful and creative. We ordered the los drowned and Chinese chicken sandwiches, both were very good. The service was initially slightly slow to start out but was completely understandable considering how busy they were. After the initial lack of service our server was attentive and very nice. I give the food, service and ambiance all 4 stars and would definitely return.
