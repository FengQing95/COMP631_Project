Little Goat Diner////4. ATMOSPHERE: It's a diner - old-school meets clean and swanky under classic lights and it has a fun photo booth at the entrance to boot. Â The dressed-up can look towards the affiliated Girl and the Goat across the street while the Little Goat provides great times and great food in a casual environment.
