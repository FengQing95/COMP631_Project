Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I feel even bad writing this because I don't give such reviews. But I wanted to say what was on my mind. After a 21 hour trip I was thrilled when I finally got here. The actual restaurant was lovely. Clean. The staff was kind. They helped me choose between the 'Lou' and the Malnati special. I got the small special, around $22 (I was treating myself) and waited a little over 30 minutes. Which the staff had warned me about and I was ok with it.
