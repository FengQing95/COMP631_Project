Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This was my first time here and I was amazed by the sheer size of the restaurant. There are so many different rooms that all have their own atmosphere. My friend and I were seated in one of the back rooms, so it was quiet and made for a really pleasant and private dining experience.
