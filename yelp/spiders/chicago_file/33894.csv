Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The best steakhouse in Chicago...hands down!  Buttery soft melt in your mouth filets.  Oh my!  But if there's one dish you have to try...Try the Bone Marrow.  You have to! Don't let it scare you, when the plate arrives.  It looks a bit greasy and the marrow def has texture. Dig in, scoop some onto that crusty crispy toast and top it with a little mint.  IT. WILL. BLOW. YOU. AWAY!  You're welcome.
