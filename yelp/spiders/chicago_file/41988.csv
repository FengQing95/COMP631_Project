Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Nice atmosphere, good food, good service.  I was craving some tapas(I studied abroad in Spain) and decided to give it a shot.  I had recently been to Cafe Iberico and wanted to try the other Spanish restaurants out.  Ill give the nod to Iberico on food.  Babareeba had good Jamon and cheeses, but Iberico's food overall was amazing.  I'll probably be back, but it's not my first choice for Spanish food if I'm gonna drop $90 for 2.
