Little Goat Diner////I ordered the braised beef sandwich. I originally wanted the bbq pulled pork sandwich, but they weren't serving that. Maybe we went too early. The bottom of my bun was super wet and somewhat soggy, but I wonder if that's how it's supposed to be. It was really good. Very messy to eat though. My BF ordered the sourdough pancakes, and he LOVED it. I thought they were average, but I don't love pancakes like he does.
