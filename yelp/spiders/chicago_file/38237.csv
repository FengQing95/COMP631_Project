Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Bavettes just rose to the top of my list of favorite restaurants in Chicago. It's not your traditional steakhouse which I love: French themed, dim lighting, tufted seats, rich blends of texture all topped with 1920s tunes. The service is impeccable from the hostess to the servers; everyone is super friendly and welcoming which is an added bonus. I do recommend getting a reservation because the wait can get a little lengthy if you decide to just walk in.
