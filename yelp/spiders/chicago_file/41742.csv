Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Our favorite items that we got.  Goat Cheese Croqueta and The Butterscotch Dessert I would come back for both of these in a second.  We also got the Goat Cheese, Pistachio, Mint and Nispera Preserves.  It was good but nothing special the pistachios got lost in the dish and that is what we were looking for.  Both the Garlic Potato Salad and Wood-Roasted Sweet Potato Bravas, Pomegranate Alioli were good but not standouts.  The Beef Tenderloin & Blue Cheese was cooked perfectly and  the bleu cheese was great but also didn't standout in the city of steakhouse.  Hope this helps.
