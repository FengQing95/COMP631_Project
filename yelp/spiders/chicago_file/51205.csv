Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago; definitely the best Tapas. The food is excellent and service has always been consistent during my many visits. Getting a reservation on the weekend is often difficult, and the noise level can be a little out of hand at times but the food is definitely worth it.
