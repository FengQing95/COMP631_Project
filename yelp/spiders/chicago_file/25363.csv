Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ordered a salad, a chicken sandwich, and the deep dish with the sausage. I really enjoyed the deep dish, although after eating I could tell it was really heavy. The buttery crust was really nice though. It was a good thing we ordered salad because it balanced out the heavy pizza. It was really good, but I think I can only have it when I am really hungry.
