Little Goat Diner////I was really excited to come here, but unfortunately did not have a great experience. It was not the food, or the server, but the safety of the restaurant. We found a small chard of glass in our ice tea. It might have came from the stacked glasses they used to serve water and iced tea. This issue was brought up to the manager, and she acknowledged the problem, but brushed it off as if it was a common, non-serious complaint. There was no apology and no promise to fix the issue. Will not be returning.
