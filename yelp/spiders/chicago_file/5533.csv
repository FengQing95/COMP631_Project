The Purple Pig////Purple Pig serves Mediterranean food in tapas style. With Yelp's recommendation, I got the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder while my boyfriend got the Scialatielli al Nero. The pork shoulder was perfectly cooked; it was juicy, and it tore apart so easily. I enjoyed the crispy lentils that came with the dish. However, the meat can be a little overwhelming as there wasn't enough greens to pair it with. Scialatielli al Nero was full of seafood like mussels and shrimp. There was a hint of spiciness which made the dish more flavorful.
