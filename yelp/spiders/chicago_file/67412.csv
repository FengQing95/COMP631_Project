Little Goat Diner////Avoid waiting in line and walk into Little Goat Bread, where you can pick up a quick sandwich, pastry or loaf of bread. Stopped in today and got an everything bagel with roasted cauliflower, cheddar cheese and scallion schmear. The bagel was different from the norm but still delicious. I absolutely love the cream cheese schmear as it reminded me of a veggie cream cheese pumped up with flavor. Can't wait to go back and try some more things!
