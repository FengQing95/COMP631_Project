Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We went here on Friday and the wait was an hour and a half. We were unaware of how crazy it can get here, so we had to pass to make it to our comedy show on time. We tried again Saturday night and the wait was even longer. We were 61st in line and it was barely moving. Again, we were way too hungry to wait that long, so we went and got gelato instead.
