Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We took up the yelp check in offer and got the free dessert on the house. Ordered the chocolate truffle cake. It was what they promised but didn't impress my soul. I took a leap of faith and ordered the caramalized banana, o boy it was something. The caramel layer on bananas gave it a nice crunch and then there were the toasted pistachios with yummy vanilla ice cream. That was a winner!
