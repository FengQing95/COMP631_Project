Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////I have been here many times, simply because of the excellent location. The food is decent, but the wait is always long. For a place named wildberry, the wildberry options are a bit disappointing, but there are a few gems hidden amongst the riff raff in their menu. I particularly love the banana bread french toast, and I'm not usually a french toast fan. The coffee bar isn't great, but the place is nice and the staff (beyond the front desk) is friendly. Being as the place is always crowded, they should give people more time to respond when their buzzer goes off to collect themselves and get there. I was with family and the kids were a little ways down the street and they made us wait for the next table because they weren't there immediately with us. Very unreasonable, particularly as they encourage people to wait outside as their "lobby" / waiting area is tiny.
