Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We were anxious to try Malnati's as a part of our own personal deep dish food war between them, Giordano's, Gino's East and Uno.  The nice server suggested the buttercrust since it's what they're known for.  I forgot to call ahead so we wouldn't have to listen to the table of female ignoramuses behind us claiming to be "wasted" after they could barely split a beer between them.  Oooh, get drunk at a family restaurant in a city full of bars, you're so cool Brewster!
