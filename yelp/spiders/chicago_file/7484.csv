Art Institute of Chicago////Like any world class museum, coming here is a religious experience for any art lover. From the beautiful architecture to the breathtaking touring exhibits, spending time here is magic. Over the years I've also enjoyed the permanent collection immensely. Â Featured are incredible galleries of Ancient, Impressionist, 15th century Spanish and Italian paintings...it just goes on and on. Whether or not you see the touring exhibit you will be blown away.
