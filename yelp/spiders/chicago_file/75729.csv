Little Goat Diner////The only thing preventing this from being a 5 star review... That Bloody Mary. I asked for it extra spicy, he told me it had a kimchee base and was naturally spicy, I said great. I was wrong. It was not great. The kimchee provided a spiciness but the flavor was not good. It was hard to finish.
