Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Ahh This place is so good! The buttery crust is a must when you go. We had the cheese bread (GET IT) pizza and I tried my little babe's ravioli and that was so so yummy too! I definitely prefer Giordano's over this place pizza wise, but we wanted to try multiple places for Chicago pizza and this is my 2nd favorite forever! Â
