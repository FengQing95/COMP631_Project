Smoque BBQ////Finally Chicago has a place that serves good BBQ. I am not your typical loud Texan, but I am from the state. Since I left Texas in 1998, I have not experienced good quality brisket outside of Texas. In addition, I have not had that great of pulled pork since my many wild nights in Memphis...problem solved again.
