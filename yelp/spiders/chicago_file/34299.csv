Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Cirque du Soleil, Kurios, just let out at United Center. It was late and we were hungry!  We called to ensure we would be able to get a table.  They luckily had a table available at 11pm.  We arrived a little early for our reservation and took a seat at the bar for a cocktail.  The bartender was friendly, engaging and on his game. I didn't catch his name, but he is from Macedonia.  The hostess showed us to our table down in the Parlor. Such a great vibe. Sleek and swanky.  We were seated at a cozy booth in a corner.  We noticed a bit of moisture in the booth, it seemed as there was some condensation in the window. We brought it to our server's attention and soon afterwards, a manager made her way over to let us know they would be happy to move us once another booth became available. While we waited, we ordered an appetizer, were toying between the foie gras terrine and garlic shrimp de jonghe.  Our server, Julio, suggested the shrimp de jonghe...and...let me tell you...YOWZA!  That was the BEST Shrimp de Jonghe...ever! The shrimp were firm and plump. Delicious little pieces of juiciness swarming around my mouth...and the toasted buttered brioche bread...holy bejebus. Just the right amount of butter slathered on it to slap up more of the garlic and herb butter.
