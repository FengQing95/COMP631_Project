Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This was my first time ever trying tapas. I was a little nervous about it but was excited to try something new. The passion fruit sangria was AMAZING! If passion fruit isn't your thing, they have five or six flavors to choose from. I tried the chicken and chorizo skewer. It was nicely cooked. The sauteed onions and peppers were great with the meat. However I did not care for the mayonnaise type sauce that they put on the plate. My best friend tried the ham and pineapple tapa, which he said was pretty good. He also tried the short rib and mashed potato dish as well. He thought it was great. The meat was very tender and the mashed potatoes were surprisingly good. We then tried the chicken and pork paella. On the menu it says that you need to have a minimum of two people to order it. Just be aware that the menu price for the paella is per serving or per person. Other than the price we both thought it was quite delicious. I thought it was the best part of the meal. We then decided to try the deserts. My friend ordered the cherry bread pudding. He thought it was good and would get it again. I tried some type of caramel almond tart, which would be amazing with a good cup of coffee. The manager brought us two free desserts outside of the ones that we ordered because it was our first time there. I thought that was very nice of him to do. All in all, I would definitely return. Maybe next time I'll be a little more adventurous with my tapa selections. I will say that its a little bit pricier than I expected, but well worth it....4 stars.
