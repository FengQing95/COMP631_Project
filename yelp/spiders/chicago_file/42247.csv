Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I have been to Cafe Babareeba many times now and I am never disappointed. Service, food and drinks always exceed my expectations! Out of all the tapas placed I have tried in Chicago I would recommend this one most. It is busy every night so definitely make a reservation! And while your waiting for your table grab a drink at the bar, its big and usually has some space for people waiting! Must trys are, the filet with blue cheese, potatoes bravas, and for dessert most definitely get the butterscotch. One of the best deserts I have had out to dinner!
