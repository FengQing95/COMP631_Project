Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My favorite addition to the Brendan Sodikoff empire. That's saying a lot because I love them all. Dry aged, prime yeah yeah yeah...I skipped these options and went to the heavy hitters. My date and I shared the tongue and cheek. Awesome of course. Somehow throughout my gf's life she had manage to never have a run in with a lamb chop so we rectified that. Great lamb chop, one of the best I've had. By server suggestion we tried the elote appetizer and that dish was the true porn star of the evening. For dessert we had the biggest most delicious wedge, slab really, of cheesecake I've ever seen in my life! Â  We started with the Bavette's punch ,and then shared a couple bottles of vino. That seems appropriate here. Try a cocktail while you review the menu, and then switch to enjoy some wonderful wine food.
