Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Let's start with the tomato. Clear as day, thick as night, Lou's pours on tomatoes in a chunky fashion that's not for the faint of heart. They contribute to hefty pieces that get saucy when handled. On top is a thick layer of cheese which is so well-prepared, it could stand to be a meal on its own. I personally love the crunchy, moist, golden thin-crust option which, being a thin sliver, leaves room for more pizza. There are locations throughout the city and I've found the consistency to be rather reliable. Gino's East doesn't stand a chance, whereas Giordano's is something you'd have to determine for yourself. Dine in, take out, but please do try one way or another.
