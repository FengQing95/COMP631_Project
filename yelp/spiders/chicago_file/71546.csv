Little Goat Diner////On my last visit a girlfriend and I split the reuben and the los drowned sandwich.  Both were juicy and flavorful and a really large portion.  We didn't need the fries, but we ordered them and they were delcious as well.  On a previous visit I sampled the corned beef hash and dark chocolate chip pancakes and it was a terrific way to start the day.
