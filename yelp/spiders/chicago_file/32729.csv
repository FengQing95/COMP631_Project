Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I read some of the other reviews and I can't believe we are talking about the same restaurant. First, my colleague ordered a Dewars on the rocks. Reply: Sorry we don't carry Dewars. He then ordered a Bacardi Lemon. Reply: sorry we don't carry Bacardi products. Another ordered a Coors Light. Reply: Sorry no Coors light. When asked for salt and pepper they brought a pinch of sea salt. It took close to 20 minutes to get our drinks. The food was decent but much better food can be had at any of the Chicago standards. The rough wood tables left me with a splinter. If your a 25 year old wanna be you might impress a date. If you looking for good service, a full bar, and better steaks go somewhere else. If you go, order the cream spinach with caramelized onions so the night won't be a complete loss.
