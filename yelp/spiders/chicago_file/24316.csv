Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////In all honesty, I thought that Zachary's out here in Rockridge tasted better, but if you've never had any sort of deep dish before, this is a great place to get introduced. We ordered the Malnati's Chicago Classic -- a tad on the greasy and cheesy side, but still delicious and absolutely filling.
