Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We came here around 6-7pm and the place was so busy. The ambiance was okay. A little too dark for my taste. The music was okay too. The place downstairs was a bit louder than the ones upstairs so if you want to hear the conversations around your group, better if you reserve seats at the 1st level but their downstairs looks cozy enough.
