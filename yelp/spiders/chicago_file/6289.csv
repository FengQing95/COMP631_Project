The Purple Pig////Service was good. And food was okay. Their portions weren't very impressive & the cost is quite high. I noticed they move their restaurant. I've heard such great things about this restaurant and although food was good; it just wasn't THAT good. They have a $20 non refundable deposit to reserve a table. I assume it's cause of the pandemic and they don't want to hold a table for a no show. Everyone was socially distanced and staffs were wearing masks so it looks like they're honoring the safety guidelines. They also checked our temperature upon arrival. I definitely don't regret coming to try the food but don't think I'll go back just because the price is too high, portion size isn't too impressive, & food was just average.
