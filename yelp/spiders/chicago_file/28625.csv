Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I know these sound like small things, but add them all up and pay $40.00 for 6 slices of pizza and.... it is not a very satisfying experience. Sunday night hbo and Lou's is something I look forward to all week. But man, what a disappointment it is to get a product like this.
