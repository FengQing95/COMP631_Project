Smoque BBQ////Being not the biggest fan of bbq, I was shocked to say that I absolutely loved it...the pulled pork and brisket are AWESOME. The brisket has that char on the outside but is tender on the inside, and the pork pulls part and is nice and charred with different textures. The babyback ribs weren't' as a big a hit w/the crew...I can't handle meat on the bone, so passed on that.
