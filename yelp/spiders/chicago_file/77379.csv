Little Goat Diner////After eating at the Girl and The Goat last weekend (spoiler, we loved it!) we decided to venture to Little Goat Dinner.  Although a different atmosphere, they still offer quality food. It was very busy on a Saturday afternoon so we waited for about 40 mins to sit at the counter. I actually really enjoyed the counter seating because we got to see all the awesome food as it was coming out.  FYI- didn't order them, but Nachos looked amazing. Will be ordering them next time.
