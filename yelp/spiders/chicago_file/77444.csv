Little Goat Diner////I've been here twice: once for brunch, once for dinner. The atmosphere lends itself more to brunch. At night, they just dim the lights a LOT to make it dinner-like. The menu has everything, but leans toward lunch and brunch. Â The food is really good, and unique, too. Standard items like a club, a Reuben, waffles, bbq beef, but all with a flavor twist that works well. Fat Elvis waffles were amazing-what's not to like about bacon, bananas and peanut butter butter? Fries were thin and tasty for the table. Nothing like Girl and The Goat, but also quality food. $17 + tip valet stinks, but that area is ridiculous to find free parking. Love the West Loop for dining...
