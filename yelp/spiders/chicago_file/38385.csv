Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The Atmosphere mixes elements that have now become hallmarks of the Hogsalt group establishments (dark, rustic and "sexy") with a slightly more polished and thematic vibe (deeply upholstered booths, wood paneled walls). It's a very pleasant vibe that feels much less corporate than most city steak houses and therefore feels more authentic and local. Â Its a great date spot and I think would impress in an understated less flashy way... Bavette's is almost the anti-steakhouse steak house. It is the opposite of the all flash Chicago Cut for example.
