Little Goat Diner////After about 45 minutes, they texted me saying our table was ready, but when we went up to the hostess's station we were told to wait a little while longer. We were pretty confused and just stood around there for the next 10 minutes while other people came up and got seated. No one explained to us what was going on or when we would be seated.
