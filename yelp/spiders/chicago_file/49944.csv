Smoque BBQ//// is BYOB!!! So bring some booze to drink while you wait in the line. My gf and I luckly had some nice ppl in line share some of their brew with us. Which was awesome. I ordered half n half rib dinner. St louis style (blackened/smoked longer ribs) and bbq ribs. Only received the st louis style with Memphis sauce. So hungry I didnt care. The sauce was tangy at first but grew on me. For sides I ordered the cooked twice fries which were delicious and saved my experience. Â The mac n cheese, sweet beans n the desserts (peach cobbler n banana something) were also pretty good. The brisket chili and the cole slaw were mediocre. Nothing really special. Chili tasted like chili from wendys.. which I like but I would have preferred to have ordered another mac n cheese or beans. The side of brisket by itself was pretty good. $5 extra.. definitely worth it. Next time going try the other bbq ribs style to complete my experience. For 2 full rib dinners with 2 sides each, 2 desserts, 2 can pops, a large order of fries and a side of brisket...the total came out to just over $70.
