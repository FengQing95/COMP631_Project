Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We ran into Ramon, in the elevator of our hotel, and the smell of the pizza made us curious. He recommended that we try the deep dish at the restaurant , so we ventured over there to eat. COMPLETELY WORTH THE HOUR WAIT, we will Definately come back! And cheers to Ramon! Great customer service . :)
