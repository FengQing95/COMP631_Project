Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place is always packed so definitely make reservations! In the summer, it's really nice to sit in the outdoor patio, although it is very crowded and you feel you're almost on top of the people sitting nect to you. The food is decent, but the tables are super small! The sangria is pretty good and the service is fast. Other than that,there are better tapas restaurants in the city.
