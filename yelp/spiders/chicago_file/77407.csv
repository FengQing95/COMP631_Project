Little Goat Diner////Ok... This place doesn't need my 5 star review... They already have over 2000 Reviews but I can't help myself and sing their praises!! I had a Blue Plate Special of their version of Pigs in a Blanket (A Hot Dog wrapped in a pancake with fried eggs on top with a BBQ Maple Syrup).
