Little Goat Diner////Since the new thing this year is gourmet diner or upscale comfort food, the place fits the mold but it's casual enough to still be a diner unlike Au Cheval down the street. The portions are generous and will definitely ruin anyone's healthy-living resolution. Take the pork-smoked fries - delicious! The menu is quite extensive and extends to their Bread side, which is more deli-like. Unlike traditional diners, the wait is long and the service is a bit slow but with a consistently full house you can imagine the kitchen is backed up. I wasn't blown away by my order choice and probably my own fault (Tonkatsu - a schnitzel sandwich) but the breakfast choices looked amazing and I will definitely be back for those items. Hands down get the desserts! The cookie pie was what it should be - Â a chocolate chip cookie in a flaky pie crust topped with ice cream!
