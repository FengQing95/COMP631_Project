Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Word of advice. Pay attention to your bill as some plates add up fast. We didn't really care because we knew the first $100 was covered but it was still surprising to see just how much food we put away. After drinks, more drinks, food, more food, and dessert I thought I was going to have to roll myself out of the restaurant.
