Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////At last we had a table and we ordered the goat cheese appetizer. It was good but I l prefer it a little more creamy. For dinner I ordered the shortrib stroganoff which was delicious. A friend ordered the steak frites which I tasted and liked. The hand cut fries were amazing! We also got a side of the broccoli. I wish I knew how to prepare broccoli at home like that!
