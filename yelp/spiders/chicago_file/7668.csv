Art Institute of Chicago////I always love going to the Art Institute because...well...it's awesome.  Yesterday, though, I went through rooms I haven't before because I'm always called into the European rooms upstairs.  Instead, we stayed on the first level and went through the American Artists exhibits and they were really excellent.  Both "Nighthawks" and "American Gothic" are there right now and I've never seen either one "live" so that was cool.
