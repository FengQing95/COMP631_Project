Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////I can't even remember the drinks we got, but all the cocktails we got were so delicious and refreshing. We ordered truffled mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, filet mignon....oh and the fresh bread they give you. I just can't rave enough. The service from the waiter was on point - he checked in on us frequently, was friendly, gave great suggestions, and just really tied the evening together.
