Little Goat Diner////I have been waiting months to try this place. I have talked up this place to go for an earlier breakfast to every one of my friends that comes to visit Chicago, however we never make it because we end up sleeping in too late and the wait for a table will be 1hr and 45minutes without fail. FINALLY my sister came into town and has a puppy so we were up early enough to get to Little Goat and not have to wait to be seated.
