Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////5 stars mostly because our server (Tina!) realized I was kinda in a rush to get the airport, told me how to get there the fastest way possible, got the check to the table when the food came, and immediately ran it and brought it back, and with boxes. So nice when you're not like hELLOO im gonna miss mah flight cause you cant run a credit card!
