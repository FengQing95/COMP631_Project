Smoque BBQ////This place is really good. The meat is very high quality, the sides are excellent, the service was really friendly as well. As far as sides and overall quality, I would say its the best BBQ I've had in Chicago. My one major complaint was the sauce. I wasn't a huge fan, I would have liked to see a couple of varieties, maybe a spicier version.
