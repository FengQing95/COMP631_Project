Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Been here twice - fantastic place with a reputation that precedes it. This place is great for any dining experience you need: dates, large parties, smaller friend gatherings etc. Cannot think of a single dish that was underwhelming or a service experience that wasn't smooth/great. The best dish (although not pictured) i've had there have been the croquettes.
