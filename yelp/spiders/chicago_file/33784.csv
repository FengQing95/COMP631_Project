Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////WOW!  What a great experience.  Great atmosphere.  Everything we ate was fantastic.  Started with the bacon as an appetizer.  It's a must.  Oysters were fabulous.  Now I am a filet guy, but the waiter recommended the bone in ribeye.  My friend and I split the bone in ribeye and the bone in filet.  Both were exquisite.  Fries for a side with a garlic dip.  One of the best meals I have ever had!
