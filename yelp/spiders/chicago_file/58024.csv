Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The inconsistencies in the meal kept me from giving Caf√© Ba-ba-reeba a higher rating, and although I had a lot of constructive criticism of the tapas, the tapas were tasty and deserving of 4 stars. Each one had great flavors that did not require any additional seasoning, even if those flavors were not to my preference. I would recommend it for a casual place for some small bites. Another con is that it is very easy to rack up a big bill here even though the smaller portions are expected.
