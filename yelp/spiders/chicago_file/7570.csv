Art Institute of Chicago////I came here alone, twice, because of the FREE ADMISSION now until February. The first time, I marveled at the older stuff-- it is overplayed, I guess, but Seurat's Sunday Afternoon... is breathtaking up close. It is literally a HUGE work of art. The second time, I checked out the modern wing, laughed at some of the ridiculous things the brilliant/crazy come up with, and took a few pictures.
