Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////In all honesty, this was the best dining experience I've had in a while. My boyfriend and I came in at 8 on a Friday and were seated at a table near the bar. The layout is different, but I like it. The tables are well spaced, so you aren't having a conversation with everyone else sitting next to you, but you still feel like it's a cozy atmosphere. They have these warm inviting circular booths--perfect for a group of 4-6. Can't wait to take out clients or have a dinner with a group.
