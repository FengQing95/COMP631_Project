Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////The hits kept coming with a visibly nervous waiter who practiced some invisibility tricks of his own. After taking our order, we never saw him again. He never checked on us, asked if we needed anything or if we were planning on doing a jig in the middle of the room. Na.Da. Being that it was breakfast time, I decided to go after the seasonal pancakes. That's sweet and sort of 'wild,' right? Seasonal? Yeah, no. Not only did our food come out after ten minutes (highly suspect) but my pancakes were so dry, I actually coughed after taking a bite. It's a good thing I'd ordered some OJ to lubricate my throat because we didn't get water until after our meal was over and our plates were gone. The cakes came without any sides and only a small amount of the special butter, which helped to make the dish seasonal. They looked so lonely and pitiful on my plate, I took a picture and uploaded it to Facebook. After waiting an hour for Southport Grocery level deliciousness, I ate the equivalent of IHoP at 3 am on a Tuesday. I simply cannot abide bad service and bad food. I don't know the audience WC is trying to attract, but I would implore brunch-seeking city slickers to go somewhere else. Nothing about WC was worth the wait.
