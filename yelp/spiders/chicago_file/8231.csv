Art Institute of Chicago////they have a fine selection of impressionism: Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, etc.  they have a wide selection of european and asian art too.  i'm not a big fan of modern art.  when a huge canvas is all black and displayed...i think, "next!!"  we walked through modern quickly.  it's definitely a nice way to see art and drink in culture.
