Little Goat Diner////My wife couldn't resist the temptation of the Bull's Eye French Toast - french toast made with onion brioche served with chicken, gooseberries and a BBQ maple syrup.  Delish and rich!  The only complaint she had was that she wished she had known an egg was inside that had a runny yoke.  Not being one for the yoke in a sunny-side up egg, a personal preference, and being in the minority of the rest of the diners, it's all good.
