Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Came here for my birthday yesterday and it was beyond perfect. Cafe baba Reba is one of my favorite restaurants so it was obviously a no brainier to take my family here. I worked with Michelle from the event staff to get everything planned. A big thank you to Michelle. She helped me customized a menu of all my favorite things. Hands down my most favorite lettuce entertain you restaurant. Our waiter was great! The management was great! The front hostess not so great (but everything can't be perfect) the menu appealed to everyone bc I included a little bit of everything with the help of Michelle. The food was absolutely delicious, the sangrias were amaze balls (red and mango). I couldn't of hoped for a more perfect birthday dinner.
