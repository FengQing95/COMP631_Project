Smoque BBQ////There's usually a line when we come during dinner, but it moves quickly so don't be deterred! Portions are large imo, but bad for my diet lol. I always go for the bbq chicken with double fries - maybe I should try another side hmmm. Anyway, the chicken is juicy and the skin is slightly crispy with the right amount of sauce and seasoning. My fianc√© has the same to say about their ribs and brisket. As for service, there's always someone available to hand out menus and answer questions for first timers. They're also pretty quick to clear off tables and help with seating. Just order at the register and find a table.
