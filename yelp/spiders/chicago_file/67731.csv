Little Goat Diner////I couldn't decide on what I wanted - I like breakfast but I don't really like savory mixed with sweet so I decided on just ordering a simple cheeseburger and fries. The burger wasn't fully cooked and was kind of plain ( not well seasoned). I didn't like the fries - they were like shoestring fries that were cut in half. I HATE shoestring fries so an even shorter version of those is even less enticing. They were well-seasoned but I wasn't impressed.
