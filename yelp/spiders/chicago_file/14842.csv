Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I'm from San Francisco and where I live, Zachary's is the place to go for deep dish pizza. Their deep dish is the best and coming here to Chicago, I had to try their authentic deep dish pizza to compare what the difference is and whether it is way better. Â Well, there was the choice between this place and Giordano's and considering how much more popular this place was, my husband and I tried this place out.
