Smoque BBQ////The sliced brisket was really tender with a good amount of fat on them (but I enjoy a bit of fat on my meat). They actually put a lot of brisket in my sandwich which was great. The sauces are both pretty tangy because it's vinegar based sauce but they are tasty. One of them was spicier than the other which I preferred. The fries are seasoned really well. The chicken definitely has a good char and smoke on it and the meat inside is really juicy.
