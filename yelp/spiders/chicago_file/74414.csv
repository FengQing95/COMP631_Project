Little Goat Diner////I don't usually eat breakfast but if I do, I eat pretty light. Kinda hard to find lighter options on this menu, not many egg-less/meatless options....I love pancakes and French toast but all those options seemed overwhelmingly heavy & complex (but were indeed creative)....so I went with sides (fruit, bagel, hashbrowns)
