Art Institute of Chicago////Always a wonderful visit. For special exhibits (Van Gogh Bedroom right now) avoid the weekend or get in line prior to opening. Pre buy the special exhibition ticket. That got us through the line just as quickly as members and fast past purchasers. More than you can see in one day, but lots to do close by if you want to go in and out.
