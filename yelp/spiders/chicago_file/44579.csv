Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////I cannot recommend Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba highly enough for a special occasion dinner! My boyfriend, mom and I went there for dinner on my birthday, which also happened to be the day my boyfriend proposed to me. Needless to say, we had a lot to celebrate. When we arrived, we told the host about the "Birthgagementday" and he sent over a complimentary round of champagne. Very nice!
