Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I could not finish my stay in Chicago without trying the Deep Dish Pizza; and Lou Malnati's was my choice. And it was a great choice! My girlfriend and I order a salad and a small pizza (with peperoni) to share. Perfect amount for late lunch! The salad was good and very well dressed, and the deep dish pizza met our expectations. It was full of cheese and a great tomato sauce, and we enjoyed the peperoni: they were very tasty. All of this including a couple of beers cost us $31. Good price for THE Chicago experience. The only negative point, the service was quite impersonal. Just so-so. But the place deserves a visit!
