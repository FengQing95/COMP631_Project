Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe////My breakfast was good. I had the veggie omelet and a side of the pumpkin pancakes. I'm not a big pancake person, but these were really good. The pumpkin and spices taste wasn't overwhelming and the pancakes were really fluffy. There were easily several things on the menu I would consider ordering despite the menu itself not being huge. They do have lunch options, but the menu is largely breakfast items. My service was very good and everyone who worked there seemed very friendly.
