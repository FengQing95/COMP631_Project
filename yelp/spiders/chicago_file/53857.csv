Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This most recent time we also tried the Paella. Wow, definitely getting it again. Order it the moment you sit down because it'll take a while to come out, but man, it's absolutely superb. I'm allergic to shellfish so we got the one with roasted pork, sausage, and pork belly. So much delicious flavor, cooked perfectly.
