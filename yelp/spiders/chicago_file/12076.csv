Art Institute of Chicago////I was really impressed with the Art Institute of Chicago! I'm no art expert, but I do enjoy looking at a variety of art, and the Institute has an extensive collection - 3 floors and 2 connected buildings of everything from modern and contemporary art to architecture to Impressionism to photography to Asian art, etc.
