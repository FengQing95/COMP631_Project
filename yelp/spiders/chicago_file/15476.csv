Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Still recovering from my recent trip to Giordano's, I decided to give Chicago deep dish another go. After much deliberation my girlfriend and I agreed upon Lou Malnati's, another reputable, local franchise. When we arrived at the only nearby location which opened its doors before 4pm, we were amazed to discover the uncanny resemblance it bared to both Giordano's and the scores of Pizzeria Uno restaurants we had visited in the past. Prior to our venture to Chicago, we made the assumption that Pizzeria Uno was a watered down version of true Chicago-style deep dish. While we have often enjoyed Uno's, we dreamed of discovering Chicago's deep dish equivalent to Difara's, a place that crafts a truly special pie.
