Art Institute of Chicago////fascinating spot and a great place to spend a leisurely afternoon wondering among the priceless pieces of art. there are tons of different art styles here and something new and different in each area. the individual rooms feel small and easily maneuverable, but I did feel a little overwhelmed in bigger areas with many options off each side. entry prices are not bad at all, with Thursday evenings free for those living in the area. the gift shop is equally awesome with lots of little cute knickknacks to remember your visit!
