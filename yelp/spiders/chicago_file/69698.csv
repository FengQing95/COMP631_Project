Little Goat Diner////We ordered coffee and it was very good.  I ordered the smoked corned beef hash, which I would not order again.  The corned beef hash did not have a smoky flavor and was underseasoned.  I asked for my egg to be cooked over easy but they were over hard.  The dish could have benefited from a runny yolk.  It may have been cooked over easy but I saw that it sat under the heat lamp for five minutes or so, so that might  be what transformed the egg into over hard.  We also had the cheese bagel with green bean and cashew "schmear."  The bagel and the shmear were both great.  We also walked through the bread cafe area.  I admire how this restaurant carries the "little goat" theme through practically everything.  I really wanted to be floored by my meal, but I was underwhelmed.  I will order something else next time.
