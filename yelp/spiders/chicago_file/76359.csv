Little Goat Diner////I had the okinomayaki with pork, I asked for light mayo on top since they wouldnt put it on the side.  My husband had the all american hamburger.  Nothing was speaking to him. I also ordered, fries, onion rings/fried pickles.  I liked my dish a lot, yes taste just like any other okinomayaki but the way they cooked this thing was outstanding. I love the way the edges and underside were crispy.  Had sliced pork and benito shavings on top. The sauce too was not overpowering.  I really suggest to request for light sauce. My husbands hamburger was as he said 'just a burger', he also said it was soggy.
