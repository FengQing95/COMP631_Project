Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////However, I was pleasantly stuffed to the gills after splitting a cheese plate (blue cheese, some kind of soft provellone-y type of cheese, and a hard parmesean; the blue cheese was off the hook and the plate came with some kind of super tasty fruit that the waitress said was an apple/pear hybrid-mmm), an order of bacon wrapped dates (slightly disappointing only because the ones at Buehl A Dias have goat cheese in them, which gives them a huge edge over Ba-Ba-Reeba's), garlic potato salad (awesome), lamb chops (BEYOND awesome! They're covered in rosemary and come with a garlic/olive oil/parsely spread to top them with and piquillo peppers...seriously, party in your mouth awesome!), and baked goat cheese. Â I couldn't even look at a dessert platter, I was so full.
