Art Institute of Chicago////The Institute is immense. If you arrive right at opening time and stay until they close, you probably still won't quite have time to see everything they have. Even someone who doesn't know much, if anything, about art, will see at least a dozen paintings that they recognize from popular culture, or social studies class. There are thousands of beautiful works, some legendary pieces, and you are bound to come across something you've never seen that absolutely blows your mind.
