Smoque BBQ////Impressive and worth the wait. got there late and the brisket was sold out. can tell the word is out . Great service. Only complaint is the fact my jacket still smell like BBQ 3 weeks later!!! comparing it to Fat Willy's I'd have to give the edge to Fat Willie's in terms of tast and the fact that I'm in love with their spicy sauce.
