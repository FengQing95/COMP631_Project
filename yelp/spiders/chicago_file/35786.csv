Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Absolutely loved this place.  The ambiance is great, food is great and the drinks are great.  This might be my favorite "steakhouse" in the city.  I had a 10 ounce filet cooked to a perfect medium.  Melted in my mouth. My wife and I split 3 sides...the corn, sweet potato and bacon.  All were very good but the bacon was my least favorite and would skip it for another side.  The corn and sweet potato are must gets.
