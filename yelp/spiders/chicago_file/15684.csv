Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Always amazing, every time. From the deep dish to the thin, you can't go wrong. Order it with extra butter crust if you like a richer kind of crust. The salads and dressings are all also amazing. You can not go wrong here for classic. Chicago pizza. Great for big groups and kids!
