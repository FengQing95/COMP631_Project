Little Goat Diner////Went for lunch after seeing Little Goat on the list of child friendly restaurants - AMAZING. My friend had a young child with her who got a little fussy at one point but the server never once seemed annoyed and was very patient with us, which we are so appreciative of. Â So not only was the service awesome, but the food was amazing too. Will definitely be back!
