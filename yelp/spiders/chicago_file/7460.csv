Art Institute of Chicago////And yes: I know they do have small, little signs around that mention parts of the museums to be closed , my bad, the ability to read is a clear advantage in life ;-) BUT: First of all, the small sign in green/blue colour just did not catch my attention and secondly i think it would have been fair if the lady at the register would have told us and informed us which areas are open and which are not. Finally it turns out, that all, literally all, areas that we are actually interested in, were closed.
