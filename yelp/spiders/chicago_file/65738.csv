Smoque BBQ////There are three (3) authentic BBQ destinations in the USA: Memphis, TN, East or West, Texas and 'Smoque BBQ', Chicago, IL. How do you know what you are consuming is authentic and truly BBQ? One answer: the flavor of the 'Smoque' permeating the meat. The balance between bitter and sweet / acidic and alkaline; it must be perfect. Perfect? Yes: present but not dominant, infused by one another not simply intertwined and never-ever should the smoque mask the flavor of the meat. There is ONLY ONE TYPE OF MEAT and ONLY ONE CUT OF THAT MEAT: BRISKET -- that offers this level of gourmand certainty. A cut of meat that is bold enough to stand up to the most interesting of BBQ that also comes out moist and infused: to be dressed as you please: CHOPPED BRISKET (not sliced).
