Little Goat Diner////Awesome food and a modern diner ambience. My friend from Portland (a Food Enthusiast) came to visit and suggested this place. The food selection are sooo good and with the option to try things with goat meat thus the name. Took a little time for us to get in since it's a St. Patty's day weekend so better call ahead. I got the loco moco with goat patty instead of regular burger paty which is an interesting twist to the hawaiian dish. Even the dark chocolate chip pancakes are amazing and the kids loved it. The food presentation and ideas are fun just like the Crispy shrimp cocktail wrapped on noodles and deep fried, then put it in a lettuce cup. Can't wait to try the restaurant "Girl & the Goat" just right across the street for a more formal dining experience. Service is also fantastic! I highly recommend going here.
