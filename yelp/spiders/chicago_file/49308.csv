Smoque BBQ////Smoque is some of the best food for the best prices in all of Chicago.  We have had everything on the menu at least once, and you honestly can't go wrong...but the fact that you don't even need a knife to slice the brisket makes it the best!  Also, the sauce that comes with each meal will knock your socks off.  Seating is a little tight, but even during the busiest of times, the staff does a good job getting everyone who wants to dine in a seat before their food is ready.  But do be aware, that on certain nights/times, the line can be out the door and around the corner...
