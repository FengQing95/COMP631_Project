Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////In the world of prime steak, it's getting hard to stand out.  There are just so many great steakhouses competing for top dog, so when you see a place listed pretty much on the top of the "lists" that exist, it's hard for it to blow you away compared to other great steakhouses you've been to.  There were 5 star items and 3 star items, so somewhere around 4 stars is about right.
