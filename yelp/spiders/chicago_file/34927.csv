Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////My wife and I came in from Boston for a little vacay last weekend. I'd read about Bavette's both here and elsewhere. Nothing I love better than a good steakhouse and I am here to tell you this is a great steakhouse. Everything was perfect. The atmosphere in the room is dark, with jazz playing in the background. The server was great and very helpful.
