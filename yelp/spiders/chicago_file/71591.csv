Little Goat Diner////Went for brunch today. Complete disappointment. Japanese pancake was off putting mix of textures and flavors, lacking unity and structure. Had to use hot sauce to make it somewhat enjoyable. Potato hash was browned well, but tasted of burnt oil. I expect better kitchen upkeep than cooking with burnt oil at 830AM on a Sunday morning. Waiter was nice, but recommending the potato hash as an accompaniment for a solo diner was ridiculous. That plate can feed three to four people as a side. Probably won't be back.
