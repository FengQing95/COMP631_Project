Smoque BBQ////Off the chart good.  My son had 1/2 rack baby back platter and I had the RIb Combo platter which  is1/2 baby back, 1/2 St. Louis.   We ended up spllitting the St. Louis which was a perfect amount of food for lunch.  Sides were cole slaw, beans and fries.  The meat was incredible, juicy and just slid off the bone.  So good. Would recommend getting there by 11:30 am for lunch to beat the lines.
