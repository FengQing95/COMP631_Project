Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////For dinner, we ordered all three of the paellas: chicken, chicken and pork, and seafood (scallops and shrimp). This was my first time ever trying paella, and I am now hooked. I have been craving this saffron goodness ever since, and I will actually be having dinner there this weekend. I thought the paella was going to be very similar to risotto, but it was not as heavy. The chef's use seasonal veggies, which is always a plus.
