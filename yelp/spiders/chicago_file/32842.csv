Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////BEST MEAL of my Life from beginning to end.  This place was unreal.   We didnt have reservations since we were just visiting for the weekend ( they book up 2-3 weeks in advance for a Friday or Saturday ).... but our hotel recommended going and waiting for a table or eatting at the bar.  We got lucky and got a pub table at the end of the bar for us to dine at.  Everything was beyond wonderful.  The service, the drinks and the FOOD.  We had the garlic shrimp, crab salad, 28 oz bone end ribeye, corn, mushrooms and the chocolate cream pie.  I am still in  a daze of how delicious everything was.  The atmosphere was romantic, dark and warm and the server was so kind and patient and laid back with us.  WE will be back.
