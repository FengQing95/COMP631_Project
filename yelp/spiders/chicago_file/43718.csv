Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////The desserts are adorable. I would highly recommend leaving room because they are small! The prices were very affordable for such a nice neighborhood and I had a really good time. I think our servers name was Marilyn. It was a unique name, so I can't forget it! Request her, get the meatballs in tomato sauce and the bacon wrapped dates, and enjoy the atmosphere!
