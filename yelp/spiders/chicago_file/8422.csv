Art Institute of Chicago////This is probably the best art museum in the United States outside of New York and Washington. Taking advantage of Corporate Social Responsibility, we entered for free thanks to Target-sponsored Thursdays. Entrance is gratis from 5-8 pm, although there's a bit of a line right at 5. If you don't mind a bit of a rush through the museum, then go at 6 to wait less. The only thing that was a bit puzzling was that you have to provide an email address in order to get tickets. I guess that's what unsubscribe buttons are for.
