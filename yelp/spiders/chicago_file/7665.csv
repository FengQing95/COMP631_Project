Art Institute of Chicago////My first stop in Chicago after checking into the hotel was to the Art Institute, which was only a stone's throw away from the hotel. It's awesome, large, airy, full of light, and so much to see. We definitely covered the galleries I wanted to see although on a Sunday, it was pretty crowded. My only gripe (and maybe because I was tired from flying in from Pittsburgh early that morning then waiting 4 hours for my brother to land) is that since there are SO many galleries, it's hard to navigate. But I just let my brother take the lead in reading the museum map.
