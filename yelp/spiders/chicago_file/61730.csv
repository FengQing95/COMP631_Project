Smoque BBQ////From a gal who knows barbecue, Smoque was incredible. Party of four and we wanted to try as much as possible so we ordered a bunch of different items. Pulled pork, brisket, ribs, sausage, beans, mac and cheese and coleslaw. EVERYTHING was excellent but standouts IMHO were brisket, ribs, sausage and beans. Oh, wait. That's almost everything we ordered! Â I wanted to bathe myself in those delicious, smoky beans!! The bun for my pulled pork sandwich was just a tad sweet which complimented the meat without overwhelming. Also loved the different type sauces.
