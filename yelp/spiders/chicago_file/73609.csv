Little Goat Diner////The burgers and "sammiches" are loaded with flavor. Depending on what you're in the mood for, you really can't go wrong. The Los Drowned often makes an appearance on my plate, but I think my favorite is the Mushroom Burger. I just can't resist the mushrooms covered in cheese sauce.
