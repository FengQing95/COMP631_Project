Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Ok after 1000 plus reviews, I cannot add anything witty or helpful!  However I do have two points: 1) my first attempt at eating at this place was on a Friday night and we arrived without a reservation.  We were told in a condescending tone by the host, that the wait was 2 hours.  ok ok, I know its Friday night but try to be nicer.  2) the next time it was a weeknight and we made a reservation and were seated right away.  Food was actually really good.  The waitress seemed a little disinterested but I was with the girls so we were too busy gabbing anyways.  With the food, I am a fan.
