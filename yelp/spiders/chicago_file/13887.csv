Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I wouldn't be a good New Yorker if I didn't make a snarky comment about deep dish not being real pizza.  With that said, of the purveyors of the Chicago style crust-tomato sauce-cheese-toppings casserole-like concoction, Lou Malnati's is among the best.  The place was kind of a zoo when I went most recently (on a Wednesday night!), but after waiting around a bit I was able to get a seat at the bar.  The bartenders were friendly and quick to deliver a beer, both things I appreciate.  Since I was traveling for work, I was dining solo, so I really appreciated that (unlike the other places I've tried) Lou Malnati's offers an individual size pizza, so I didn't have to order the "small" that was really intended for a small army.  My Chicago Classic with sausage and mushrooms was delicious (I only wish I has added green peppers or spinach) and the prices were very reasonable.  Definitely recommend.
