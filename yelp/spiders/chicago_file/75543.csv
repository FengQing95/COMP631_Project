Little Goat Diner////Had heard about the hype about this place for years and had seen it multiple times on Yelp so my sisters and I decided to give it a try. We got here at around 8am on a Saturday and we're seated immediately. The restaurant didn't start filling up until 9:30am. We were pleased to know that we could order anything off the menu no matter the time of day. We took advantage.
