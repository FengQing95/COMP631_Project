Little Goat Diner////Definitely worth the stop. Went in early on a Saturday night (about 5:45 - 6:00 PM) and we were seated right away. The place started filling up fast but our service was not affected. I got the American burger with mac 'n' cheese and my husband got the chicken tenders with mashed potatoes. Both were incredible! I absolutely loved the decor and vibe - a blast from the past with a modern twist. They also have a rooftop that is worth checking out if the weather is cooperating.
