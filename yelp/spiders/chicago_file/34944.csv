Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We went last night for an impromptu dinner and reaffirmed out love for this place.  Being a wino, I love their corkage policy of sharing a glass with another guest.  I get to bring my unique wines without paying triple price and someone there gets to enjoy a taste of something new.
