Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I really enjoyed the veggie deep-dish pie I had this weekend. We got it for carry out so we could eat it on the train home to KC and I'm glad we did. The veggies were clearly fresh, and it had a lot of cheese and tons of flavor. They're heavy handed with the garlic at this joint, just the way I like it. The crust seemed to me to be a perfect balance of the yellow corn meal (coughGinoscough) and bready yeast dough (coughGiordanoscough) that I've come to know and love. And considering we had to wait a full hour before devouring this little gem, it held up really well, it still had great texture in all the right places and didn't get soggy. The (highly unstable) dried herbs that were included as toppings were a nice little bonus.
