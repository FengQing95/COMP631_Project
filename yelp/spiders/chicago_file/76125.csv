Little Goat Diner////I'm no...... food expert.... but I'd like to think I know when something tastes fantastic. And everything I ate here the other day -- parathas burrito, vegetarian home fries (not listed on menu, but waitress-recommended) and veggie japchae were incredible. I felt like every type of taste bud on my tongue was being stimulated; the food was just that well-balanced. Each dish was deliciously savory, and each ingredient gave just the right amount of simplicity AND complexity to create a well-rounded, well-thought out dish. The flavors are just incredible. Wish I could think of another way to explain this but wow -- everything was just SO yummy.
