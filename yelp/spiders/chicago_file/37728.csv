Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////The food...  Wow.  I give credit to whoever created the menu.  It's simple (perhaps deceptively so) but incredibly well executed.  There isn't a billion ingredients to overwhelm or a chemical reaction gimmick to surprise you.  It's excellent food done extremely well.  We ordered the crab cake, steak frites, elote corn, sprouts, and the chocolate pie.  It doesnt seem like a lot of food but everything is so generous in portions that you can share and indulge.  The crab cake is a must order for any seafood lover as it is mostly crab and incredibly tasty.  The brussel sprouts were so good... i would dare anyone to eat this and say it isnt the best sprouts they've had and it didnt seem like it had bacon either! The steak frites were really good... its a ridiculously great value for anyone who wants good beef but not a lot.  Plus the fries... ohhh they did them right.  Nice deep tan colour... almost as good as beef tallow fries I got across in London.  And the corn was a good take on the street corn you can find in Chicago.  As for the dessert... DO IT.  The chocolate pie was chocolate on crack.  I dont know what they do to it but it makes you think it's one of the best chocolate desserts you ever had.
