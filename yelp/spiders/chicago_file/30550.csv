Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Came here on a Friday afternoon for what I was hoping was a quick bite. I sat at the bar, where a snippy bartender took my order. He ran off before I could finish the order, so I had to call him back and finish adding toppings. After 45 minutes I asked about my pizza, and the bartender brought up that I should've gotten his attention. Not like I spent 15 minutes trying or anything!!
