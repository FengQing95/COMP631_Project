Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////We tried to put our name in at 5:30 and was quoted a 4 hour wait.  My girlfriend and I went to Gilt Bar after and put our name in because we wanted to eat around 8 and were quoted around 2 hours.  My girlfriend and I went home and came back around 7:20.  We went to bavette's and hovered around couches, but didn't have much luck.  As we were leaving to go to gilt bar, we got texted that our table was ready at bavette's.  Perfect!
