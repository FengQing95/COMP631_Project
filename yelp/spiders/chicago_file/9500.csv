Art Institute of Chicago////I had to see some of the most notable works (A Sunday on the La Grande Jatte, At the Moulin Rouge, Nighthawks, American Gothic), but always try to spend more time in the other galleries. This is a place where you could get lost for days. That is a compliment and a minor complaint.
