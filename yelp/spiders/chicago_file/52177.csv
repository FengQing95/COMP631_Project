Smoque BBQ////After Food Network, each time we have wanted BBQ from Smoque they have been out of of at LEAST two menu items (and they really only have four) and in one instance, had stopped taking phone orders all together! The food seems to have suffered a little too. I wonder if they are having a hard time cooking in the quantities they need to now. There is also an apparently constant line almost out the door for ordering, and while it moves pretty well, it is still a long irritating line.
