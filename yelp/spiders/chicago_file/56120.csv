Smoque BBQ////Peak hours have a very long line but it seems to move rather quickly. The food is cheap for the portions. For $10 I got pulled pork, a small side of the best mac & cheese everrrr, and fries! Just an FYI, they turn over tables quick, so this isn't a place to eat and linger. Eat. Drink your beers. Leave. Go, go, go!
