Art Institute of Chicago////I personally love the impressionist section and was humbled to see real Monet, Degas, and Van Gogh!  What an impressive collection! And of course, who wouldn't want to see the authentic American Gothic!  Most amazing is that you can take pictures here and take those memories home!  Museums in Hawaii don't let you photograph authentic pieces.
