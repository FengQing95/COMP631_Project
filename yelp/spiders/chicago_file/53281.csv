Smoque BBQ////Alright, I'm going to state this up front first - I grew up in Texas, so I am accustomed to the Texas style of bbq and am totally subjective... Â I have been disappointed before with what has been touted as "great bbq" here in Chicago, and I am always on the hunt for good bbq, and this place did live up to its hype.
