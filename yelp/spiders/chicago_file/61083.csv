Smoque BBQ////There are rules outside of the restaurant, such as you cannot pick where you want to sit.  I guess seating is tight at the restaurant so they need to pack everyone in. We had a table sitting right next to us, even though there were other open seats available.  It did start getting busy later in the evening so I can see why they want everyone seated in an orderly fashion.
