Little Goat Diner////Food is good.  Be prepared to spend more than normal if go for breakfast.  I've been 4 times at breakfast lunch and dinner.  Service is consistently sub par.  It seems like ton of servers but nobody pro actively pays attention to need of coffee or simple water.  Very friendly and knowledgeable but Please stay focused on customers simple needs
