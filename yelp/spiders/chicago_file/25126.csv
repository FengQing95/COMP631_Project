Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Pizza is delicious. I have eaten also deep dish in Gino's and its safe to say that both are similar. I think Lou is better though :-) It is deep dish so you need to take into account that it is tick. A lot of chees and the crust with butter makes perferct combination with the sousage and pieces of tomatos on the top. I strongly recommend to try it if you didn't.
