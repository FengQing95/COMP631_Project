Little Goat Diner////Had to try it. Waited in line, but who didn't? Place was packed, loud, buzzing. Friend and I split everything - we went around 2pm. Biscuit (with gravey) was the most memorable thing we ate. The star was the biscuit. We split the Crispy Fun Chicken sandwich - no complaints. Inspiring menu - I would def go back.
