Smoque BBQ////The brisket was very tender and the BBQ sauce was kind of lacking.  I guess I'm not a fan of vinegar based BBQ sauce  but aside from that the tenderness and texture of the meat was amazing.  The meat really made up for the BBQ sauce.  I'd recommend the chopped brisket but you can't really go wrong with any of the meats there.  The mac and cheese was pretty good and the beans were pretty good too.  The peach cobbler was very tasty.  My only gripe was the price, I thought you'd get a little bit more for what you pay for.  One thing I thought was pretty nice was the host type guy who walked around and made sure everything was going OK.  I thought that was a nice touch for a BBQ joint.
