Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We went all out and ordered a bit of everything.. Chorizo wrapped dates were to die for, the lamb, pork shoulder and beef empanadas were my favorite. Food came out quickly, the servers were very attentive .. They cleaned up quickly and made sure we had everything we needed, fresh plates, water.. Etc. good music. Good atmosphere. Will definitely return!
