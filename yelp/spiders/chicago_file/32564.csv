Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Our son gave us a gift certificate for Bavettes and we used in for our anniversary dinner.  I think we just found our new favorite restaurant.  We always like to arrive a little early to have a cocktail before dinner.  The bar area is a little small but the drinks were fabulous.  The bartender was well versed in recommending a Bourbon for my husband and my whiskey sour was made with the freshest ingredients possible.  Another couple joined up for dinner.  They both ordered steaks and were so wowed by the flavor that they became members of the clean plate club!  My husband had the Berkshire pork chops and no leftovers there either.  I had the short rib strogonoff and was the only one with leftovers.  I had leftovers, not because it wasn't tasty, but due to the large portion of food.  The short rib was tender you definitely did not need a knife.  We ordered 3 sides which was plenty for the four of us.  Our waiter ( I wished I could remember his name) was spot on with all of his recommendations.  I had heard that the whiskey ice cream was fabulous but the group I was with was set on vanilla.  I was glad that they listened to our waiter and with the golden brick sundae with whiskey ice cream.  It was so rich but had a little kick to it!!  I could go on and on about both the service and the quality of food but what I am going to do instead is make another reservation!!
