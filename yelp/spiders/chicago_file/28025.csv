Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Lou Malnati's was our second deep dish stop. We preferred this over Pequod's. The main differentiator is the crust, Lou Malnati's signature Buttercrust is freckin' delicious! We shared a small pan among two people which was more than enough food for us. We had an extra slice to take back which I was really debating on finishing! I might have had to be carried out of the restaurant if I did..
