Art Institute of Chicago////My only slight eyebrow raising moment may have been when I went to see Felix Gonzalez Torres's exhibit when it was up and went into the next room. Unfortunately, there was no sign displaying do not touch the art (after Torres, interactivity seemed natural) so a friend was sitting on a chair that was displayed and the guard came up and told us that this was art and one does not touch art. We were amused as we looked beyond her to the next room, but complied.
