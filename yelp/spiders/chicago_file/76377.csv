Little Goat Diner////I was disappointed to find that the Los Drowned was rather fatty and contained tons of cabbage a radishes. The sandwich also had a purple chunky spread on it. The waitress informed me that not all ingredients are listed on the menu (the cabbage, radishes, and purple spread). Also, while an order of regular fries is huge and looked delicious they were very sweet.
