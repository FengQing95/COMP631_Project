Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////By far one of the most amazing dining experiences I've had in 7 years in Chicago. From start to finish, bavettes blew us away. The ambiance is absolutely perfect for a romantic night or special occasion, with candles lit and chandeliers drenching the whole room in warm dim light. The food was insanely good. Don't sleep on the steak tartare which blew me and my date away. We opted for truffle Mac and Brussels sprouts to go along with our New York strip (cooked perfectly btw). The only thing I'd skip would be the Brussels sprouts which lacked seasoning and weren't as tender as they needed to be. Martinis, old fashioneds, and house red wine all did the job. Our server Barbara was great - so attentive and kind but not overbearing. The entire staff ran like a well oiled machine. We did NOT want to leave! Thanks for making my boyfriends birthday so special.
