Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////We live close to the State Street location and it's our go-to pizza. On our last visit I tried the personal size crustless pizza as a lower carb option and it was delish with a sausage crust and the mushrooms I picked for my topping. I recommend getting it extra crispy so the sausage doesn't get soggy. Â The regular deep dish is always good as well. Get the butter crust and don't pick too many toppings. Their signature salad is also one of my favorites.
