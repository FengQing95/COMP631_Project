Smoque BBQ////anyway, this place is pheeenomenal. we went there on a sunday night and it was packed, line out the door, no tables available, packed. however, when i had called, the girl on the phone said it would be at least 45 minutes; i dont think it even took 20 and while waiting we scored a table. bonus! they have guys walking around helping bus tables and saving you a spot which is super nifty. so, i got the half and half sandwich with beans and cornbread. unbelievably good, i literally craved more instantly. they have sweet tea (real brewed) which is the biggest plus in the world. sweet tea with bbq is literally the only way to go.
