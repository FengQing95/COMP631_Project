Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is always a great place to bring people who are visiting the city. Fantastic atmosphere, delicious sangria (we got the red, but I am sure the fruity ones are equally delicious), and a smorgasbord of great tapas to please everyone's tastebuds. I went with a group of six people, so we were able to try many different items. I loved the bacon-wrapped dates, the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, and the spinach-manchego stuffed mushrooms. The endive salad and the brussel sprout salad were a nice, light choice to balance the heavier dishes.
