Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Awful customer experience best described as misleading. Came to the restaurant and was told it would be a 25 minute wait but they allow you to pre-order your pie. What they failed to let you know is that only after you sit down do they actually cook your order (or "finish" cooking?). Anyway since I was starving - and knew it would be more than 25 minutes until I found somewhere else to eat, sit down, order and get my food, I thought this would be more efficient. Only when we sat did they tell us it would still be another 30 minutes until we would actually get food. If I wasn't so weak from hunger I would've left - but had to stay for the food. The pie was good though, I will say that. But way too long and deceptive on the length of time kills this place.
