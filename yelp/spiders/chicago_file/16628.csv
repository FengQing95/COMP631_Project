Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Chocolate Chip Pizza:  The individual sized dessert was coated with a bottom layer of a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie.  The dish was then topped with 2 quarts of ice cream, whipped cream, and cherries.  From my first visual gaze of this dessert, I was even more astonished at the fact that Chicagoans were able to create consumable monstrosity after consumable monstrosity.  The taste did not disappoint, although I found the dessert to be rather sweet, the cooling sensation generated from the ice cream gave the buttery chocolate chip cookie the right balanced needed for such a dessert.  The whipped cream added a nice touch of lighten sweetness to both the ice cream and cookie.
