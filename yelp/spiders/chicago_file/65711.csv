Smoque BBQ////Most of the meat is lean here. The pulled pork was delicious. I really enjoyed the crispy pieces. The chopped and sliced brisket were also very good. Two of our orders of sliced brisket were lean and one wasn't, so the brisket is not totally consistent. In all, the meat was tender and had a nice smoke flavor. The only thing I didn't care for was the Texas sausage. It wasn't memorable; it tasted like a regular sausage.
