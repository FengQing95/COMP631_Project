Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////Food - I wasn't too impressed with the food.  I didn't think the prices matched up with the food.  If you want to order something, I would recommend the Paellas--portions are big and it is good...They use goat cheese for a lot of their dishes and I guess I'm not a fan of goat cheese..
