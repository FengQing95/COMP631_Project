Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////This place has become a staple for me to bring out of town guests. It's always fun sharing all the small bites and pitcher(sss) of sangria. I could eat the spicy potatoes as my whole meal, but I couldn't pass up on the Brussels sprouts salad. The chorizo wrapped dates are a classic, and if you like goat cheese, I highly recommend the tomato and goat cheese. This place is great for sharing but if you want to order your own things, that's fine too! White sangria is a must. It's definitely sweet like sangria, but I hate sweet cocktails and could probably down a pitcher of this by myself.
