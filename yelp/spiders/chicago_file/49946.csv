Smoque BBQ////Finger-lickin' good.  It was so good I almost crippled myself trying to be a member of the clean plate club... and then I still could have stuffed some sauce in my pockets for the road.  One of the marks of a good bbq place is that when you leave you should smell like grilled meat.  I definitely went to bed that night dreaming of ribs and the brisket they ran out of because the line was so long... I'll be back for you, brisket; I'll be back.
