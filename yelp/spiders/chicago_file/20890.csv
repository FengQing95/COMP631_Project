Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////So we're in Chicago for the weekend and of course you have to do the touristy thing and try the best Chicago style pizza. So I hit up yelp for recommendations. Lou's apparently is the place to go, and his father is one of the original creators of this pizza masterpiece. But wait, why would a masterpiece not receive 5/5? Because it is a pizza joint that only serve 6 beers. Because its a pizza joint without the pizza joint vibe. Because the pizza was lacking. No spicy or even richness to the sauce. No well seasoned toppings or crunchy, chewy crust; it was too flaky like pie crust. To be honest I am not sure if I went to this location or not, but considering this is a local chain and a local favorite this is applicable to all of them.
