Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////We visited Ba-ba-reeba the other night. I took out my aunt who was in town visiting, my wife and my brother and my mom. The service once again has been impeccable, as it has always been with your restaurant. Yes, that was not my first time enjoying a beautiful evening at your establishment. Actually, it would also be fair to note that to maintain that level of service with labor shortage....is nothing less than remarkable. We ordered many tapas, pitchers of sangria and of course the Paella de Mariscos for 4 people. Everything tasted phenomenal, the freshly toasted bread used was out of this world. Dishes came in flying, presentation was beautiful yet simple. The only reason why I am giving it 3 stars, is sadly the experience we've had with Paella. I am a strong believer, that if you decide to put something very ethnic on your menu. Something that is known to require skill and quality ingredients to make. Something that is a pride of another culture....you gotta go all out and make it Spectacular. 10 stars. Otherwise don't attempt it at all. In the case with paella from your restaurant, which I've ordered for the first time, it was far from perfect. The rice was wet, the Cod used was most definitely living its last day before being tossed. There was no WOW effect! The portion however was insane, I mean it was a paella for 4 and it came out to around $75. However 6 people could've easily shared it with no issues. One last thing, even though it looked like the Paella was distributed table side, I am almost 100% CERTAIN it was not cooked in the pan but rather precooked before. Which is by Spanish traditions considered a crime. Point is, if you do decide to continue with serving Paella, and you are concerned about costs and still trying to keep the same profit margin as before. Just lower you portion size, to about half the size. Take the savings from that and invest it in the ingredient quality and preparation. I would pay that $75 but for the better product, and MUCH rather sacrifice the portion size. After all it is a European dish, it does not need American sized portion. I remember one of the things Rich said, back in the day. " guests will always remain loyal to quality, not quantity".
