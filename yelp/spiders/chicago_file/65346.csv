Smoque BBQ////One of my favorite BBQ spots in all of Chicago! This is backed up by the fact that Smoque is Guy Fieri approved. I came here on a late Friday afternoon and the restaurant wasn't busy at all, though I wouldn't expect the same for for weekend lunch or dinners. We ordered the pulled pork sandwich, BBQ beef brisket, and the gumbo. We definitely could've gone without the gumbo but the sandwich and brisket was prepared just the way I like meat - extremely flavorful and moist. It doesn't seem like a lot of food at first but once you start eating, the meat fills you up really quickly.
