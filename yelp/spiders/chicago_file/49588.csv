Smoque BBQ////Absolutely fantastic food.  We have tried everything on their menu and it is all great.  I like that their mac n cheese and peach cobbler come in individual littlealuminium containers.  The brisket is especially goo.  The staff is very friendly and efficient.  I ws worried by the large line but it moved along really well.  They also help you find seating - sharing a table if need be.
