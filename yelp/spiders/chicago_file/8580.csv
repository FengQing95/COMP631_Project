Art Institute of Chicago////I could go on and on describing the ever changing institute but it's almost like a fiction story "Hey, did you get a chance to see the Munch exhibit" or "How cool was the Taoism and Arts of China Exhibition". It's almost unbelievable how they are such a revolving door of culture and history. I think it's funny when people ask what kind of art lover am I... Contemporary, Modern, Impressionism, and so on. As if you could just pick one!! There are pieces that I love from each genre, like how can you not love Picasso's blue period, or the warped mind of Dali, and the detail of Albright. So much to choose from and now even more with the new modern addition. Check it out, it's like a whole new area to play in!
