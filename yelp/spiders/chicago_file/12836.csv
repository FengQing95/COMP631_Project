Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Really delicious deep dish pizza.  Kate was a great server with a wonderful personality.  I'm really impressed by the efficiency and flow of the staff. They kept things going with pre-ordering your pie and turning tables quickly.  This isn't some little mom and pop enterprise but you can see how they've been successful for so long and have built a mini empire. Worth the stop!
