Smoque BBQ////When people are willing to wait over an hour outside the restaurant for the food, that says a lot! My St. Louis ribs were sooooo good! It was tender, juicy, and exactly what I needed.  The Mac & Cheese was surprisingly yums too! I'm very picky about my mac & cheese, none of that kraft easy mac stuff for me!  This one came with a great crust and very cheesy on the inside.  The pulled pork was super succulent and very flavorful, even without the bbq sauce.  The brisket was almost too tender, I had the hardest time trying to pick up a piece with my fork.  The Brisket Chili was their special side of the day, that was so-so, I'd probably try the beans next time..or just get 2 mac & cheeses!
