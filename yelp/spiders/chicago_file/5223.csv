The Purple Pig////For food we ran through a bunch of items on the menu. The top was absolutely the bone marrow... what made this dish stand out was not the perfectly cooked bone but the bright citrus and parsley side with capers and onions. It brought a wonderful brightness to a traditionally rich and heavy dish.
