Bavette's Bar & Boeuf////Loved the BOYB policy here. You have a share a glass of wine with another table. Definitely makes for good conversation. Â I got the steak frittes here. The meat was cooked perfectly exactly how I had requested, and the sides were amazing. Definitely order the thick cut the bacon and the spinach.
