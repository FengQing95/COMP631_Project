Smoque BBQ////Because this place is small, you're easily enveloped in the aroma that is BBQ'ed meat. My husband and I ordered the brisket platter and the 1/2 slab baby back platter and added a Texas sausage link. Coleslaw comes with each platter as well as 2 sides. Â So we chose cornbread, baked beans, fries and mac/cheese.
