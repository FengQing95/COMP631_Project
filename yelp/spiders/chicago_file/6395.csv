The Purple Pig////The Grilled broccoli was also very tasty. Love how they could turn such a basic vegetable into something so full of flavor but not too overpowering with the vinaigrette. The Crispy Pig Ears were a little too salty for my taste but most of my party enjoyed it. In addition to these, we also got the Pork Belly. Was pretty good, the meat very soft and easy to cut through. The star of the show was definitely still the Bone Marrow though.
