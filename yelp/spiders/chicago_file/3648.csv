The Purple Pig////Amazing food and great service! I went around 2pm on a weekday and was immediately seated at the bar. I had the salted beets to start- the presentation of the dish was outstanding and the combination of beets, whipped goat cheese and pistachio butter was so delicious. I had the prime New York strip steak for main course- the steak was cooked to my tasting and the accompanying pepperonata and raspberry-bone marrow vinaigrette added so much flavor to the dish. Highly recommend this place and is on my list of places to return to whenever visiting Chicago!
