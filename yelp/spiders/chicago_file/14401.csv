Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////I seriously hate pizza in general. This is the only pizza I eat and I love it. Lou's is the only reason I will never leave Chicago. Everything is amazing. Their cheese balls are so good their salads are so fresh and delicious. You can buy their vinaigrette. I think a whole bottle is like 7 dollars and it'll late you all year.
