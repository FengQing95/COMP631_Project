Smoque BBQ////luckily, the bbq was really fine as well. the sauce isn't the typical sweet molasses variety, but a blend of sweet and vinegary tanginess that is a welcome departure from my usual. the chicken had a nice spicy rub on the skin which added to the overall flavor. cole slaw here isn't held together with a mess of mayonnaise, and its fresher crunch of cabbage w/a touch of red onion offset the bbq nicely. the fries were how i like em, not too thick, well browned and crunchy.
