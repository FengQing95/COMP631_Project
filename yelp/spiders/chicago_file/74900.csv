Little Goat Diner////We ordered the Bulls Eye French toast that came with fried chicken and strawberries. This was by far my favorite dish. The French toast had more egg content than normal French toast, but it worked and I really liked it. The fried chicken and strawberries and syrup perfectly complemented the French toast. SO GOOD. Definitely hit the bull's eye on this one.
