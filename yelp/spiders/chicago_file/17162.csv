Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////This has got to be the best place for Chicago style pizza. It is both affordable and good. Be sure you go well in advance of when you want to eat as there was an hour wait for us. We had no issues with this as they had been highly reccomended and we were on vacation so there was no issue waiting!
