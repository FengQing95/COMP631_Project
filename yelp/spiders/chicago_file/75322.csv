Little Goat Diner////1 word, YUM! My friend and I waited for about 30-45 min on a Sunday at about noon (it wasn't a problem because we weren't starving and knew we would work up an appetite. We ordered the omelette of the day which was fresh tomato, green onion and tzatzki cream cheese, it was delicious!!! We also ordered the Bulls eye French toast (highly recommend), major party flavor in my mouth! I wanted to order a goat milk latte but I chickened out last minute and ended up with a regular latte, it was still delicious but it gives me a reason to go back and try the goat milk latte.
