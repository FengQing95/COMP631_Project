Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////The deep dish was the same as ever from there, top notch.  Sadly the thin crust does not live up to some of the better thin crusts around, like Pat's or Vito and Nick's.  If you have ever had either one of those thin crusts, that is the gold standard as far as I think thin crust pizza should be.  The sausage thin crust from Lou's could have been more crispy, a little thinner perhaps and for sure, cooked more.
