Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!////My favorite place for date night! And they have great sangria. The bacon wrapped dates are a solid go to plate. We love the small plates because it allows us to try something new without over committing. Â And we are never disappointed with our choices! The restaurant has good ambiance too
