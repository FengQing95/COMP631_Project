Little Goat Diner////Little Goat Diner is absolutely amazing. For starters, unlike The Girl and the Goat, its sister restaurant across the street, Little Goat does not require reservations. It's also open 24/7 making it the perfect place for a late night snack or a midday meal and guaranteeing that there will be points when there's no line. We walked right in on a Monday night. If you do have to wait, wait at the coffee bar next door, also part of Little Goat. The coffee (and tea) drinks are spectacular and a good way to get started.
