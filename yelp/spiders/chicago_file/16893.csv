Lou Malnati's Pizzeria////Our group of six with seated within minutes without a reservation. The waiter came quickly and today I drink orders and reappeared with them very shortly.  In no time the server had made suggestions, and taking a rather complicated order. And in very little time our Malnati salad arrived. This salad is unique and delicious.  It is a mixture of romaine lettuce, tomatoes, black olives, mushrooms, salami bits and gorgonzola cheese with our Sweet Vinaigrette and romano cheese.  We ordered  family size for $12.25 and there was plenty  for six with second helpings (4 guys & 2 gals) and the sweet vinaigrette dressing was amazing and addictive. You have got to try to salad dressing.  One of our party does not eat pork and they gladly prepared a small version for him.  By the way, they have several gluten free options here.
