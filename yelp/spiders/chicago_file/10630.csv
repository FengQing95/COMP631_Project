Art Institute of Chicago////I fall deeper in love with this museum after every visit. It's a bit pricey but well worth every dollar. Speaking of dollars, coat check is only a $1.00. Plan on spending the full day here, 2-3 hours simply won't due. Other observations, the museum layout is very accessible consisting of multiple buildings all connecting on the first level. There is plenty of seating throughout to appreciate a view or simply relax and take a break.
