,,,,,"New York, NY 10001"
,,,,,"The line for this place on the weekends is HUGE. I was so surprised, Like The bagels are really this good ?? And Let me tell you they AREE  One of the best Bagel's I've had in a while. Definitely worth the wait, in addition to our Bacon Egg and Cheeses we got the parfait and everything is freshly made so I absolutely loved this place. They have a lot of staff to deal with the order load so that was good to see and all the baking is done in Premises so you're getting the real fresh deal !! Will be back, definitely recommend !!!"
,,,,,"Solid bagel spot near Penn Station. The lines were out the door on a Monday morning, but moved fast. We ordered the sausage and egg, and smoked salmon sandwich, both on everything bagels. Enjoyed both our sandwiches, bagel had a nice chewy texture. They also had fresh squeezed orange juice, which was really good. "
,,,,,"If you ask me where my favorite NY bagel spot is, Russ and Daughter's is probably my favorite, but Best Bagel comes in second on my list for NY bagels."
,,,,,Pretty darn good bagel for an affordable price. Was about $4-5/bagel and you get to pick a variety of bagel types and fillings. I went with the everything bagel with garlic cream cheese and it was . Line moved quick and service was friendly and attentive. You order in one spot and then lay at another and there's not a whole lot of seating but it's a good food to eat on the go.
,,,,,I ordered a sesame bagel and schmear because I really wanted to try this bagel on it's own.   ($5.01)
,,,,,I like my bagels chewy and I found it to be crispier than anything else so to me this was not the best bagel and the schmear wasn't a schmear  it was more like a goop.  It was so much cream cheese oozing out if it I couldn't really enjoy the bagel I had to take some of it off. 
,,,,,If you like  crispy  bready bagel you might like this place.  The bagel is large and with all the cream cheese you'll be full just a few bites in.
,,,,,Great bagel shop! Crowded so be patient and you will be rewarded with delicious food. Loved the selection.
,,,,,"I was staying in the area for work at MSG and looked for spots to grab an early bite. We arrived around 7am on a Thursday and there was no line which was great. Ordered a bacon, egg and cheese on an everything bagel toasted + large iced coffee. The service was super quick and the shop was quiet, we got our order really fast. We took our bagels and SUPER strong coffee with us back to MSG with us and ate there. From first bite I was so impressed. I had taken 3 of my workmates and they were all so happy with their bagels and the coffee - it was exactly what we needed. The bagel was stuffed full, toasty but moist at the same time. Took me all morning to drink my coffee because it was so strong."
,,,,,We attempted to come back at 9am Friday and then 10am Saturday but the line was out the door so we passed - the other bagels we got both times didn't even hold a candle to the Best Bagel and Coffee. I will definitely be back for early morning bagels in the future (when there's no line).
,,,,,"Best Bagel has great tasting food, good service, and very reasonable prices.  That's my formula to come back over and over again.  Western omelette, Asian salad, and their bagels are what we enjoy, and always get our order right.  (Never need to check the bag or receipt.)."
,,,,,"As good as it gets!  I ordered the smoked salmon sandwich on everything bagel.  It was huge!  Very, very limited seating space, but around the corner Macy's had some outdoor tables; weather was nice so it worked out perfect for us."
,,,,,"This is one of my favorite bagel sandwich place. Was recommended by a friend and turns out it was close to our hotel. It really busy here and usually a line. We didn't wait too long though. They have so many things here--sandwiches, pasteries, coffee, etc. My boyfriend ended up getting the breakfast bagel sandwiches. Their bagels are fresh and soft and there are so many flavors to choose from. I love their blueberry bagel. Definitely another bagel spot to try if you are around Manhattan Town. I would come back if I am around!"
,,,,,Such a bizarre location for such a GEM.
,,,,,Order in advance for pick-up because the place gets jammed.
,,,,,"THE BEST bagels -- both cc ones and egg sammy ones -- in all of NYC.  I just wish it were in a more centralized place (ie, right outside of my office)."

,,,,,"LoveMama is definitely a great hole-in-the-wall tri-Asian fusion restaurant! Coming here on a weekday afternoon around 12PM, it was surprisingly vacant - as we were the only ones there when we entered. Feeling adventurous, my boyfriend and I had Malaysian food for the first time. We did the lunch special and ended up ordering the shumai dumplings + an eggroll with mushrooms inside for our appetizers, Mee Goreng noodles, and Rendang Nasi Lemak - jasmine rice, curry chicken (our choice of meat), and various vegetables and nuts. We also split a Thai Tea for us to drink! "
,,,,,"The Thai Tea was decent - it didn't seem to stand out as much as other Thai Teas that I have had. It was large though, so I definitely got my Thai Tea fix for the day. "
,,,,,"I was surprised to only receive 2 small dumplings and 1 eggroll as the combined 2 appetizers. I didn't know 1 eggroll would serve as one appetizer in itself. The dumplings were also okay - good but not great pork dumplings. My picky self decided not to eat the mushroom eggroll, as I don't like mushrooms, but my boyfriend said it was okay."
,,,,,"The Mee Goreng noodles were tasty! They looked very spicy just based off the color alone, but they were more so savory with a kick! The size of the noodles was good too - it could probably serve as 1.5-2 meals, depending how much you can eat. "
,,,,,"The Rendang Nasi Lemak is very strong and aromatic - which can be either good or bad depending on how much one loves curry. My boyfriend LOVES curry, so this was the perfect meal for him! It was a bit strong for me, but something I loved is that it wasn't heavily drowning in curry sauce, unlike some curry dishes I have eaten. My favorite part of the dish was the egg topped with spices. The natural taste of egg seemed to lighten the powerful taste of the spices - they compliment each other well! "
,,,,,"Overall, LoveMama was a great place to quickly eat some lunch, especially if one is trying to branch out of their comfort zones! I would probably just stick with the entrees as opposed to getting the small appetizers."
,,,,,"Visiting from California, and honestly it's one of the best restaurants in New York or the best restaurant for south East Asian cuisine!"
,,,,,"A great place to satisfy your Thai, Vietnamese AND Malaysian cravings all in one meal. We came here for dinner at 8pm on Sunday and sat outside. The staff was very welcoming and friendly. "
,,,,,"- Uncle Plump's Dumplings: Delicious and def plumped! They were shaped like wontons with very thin wrapping packed with juicy pork. The sauce was definitely the highlight. It was nutty, savory with a little heat from the chili oil. GET IT!!!"
,,,,,"- Rendang Nasi Lemak: Average. The beef rendang was rich but not as spicy as I would've liked. It paired nicely with the fragrant coconut pandanus jasmine rice. The pickled vegetables, peanuts and egg added extra flavors and textures. "
,,,,,"- Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles): Yum! It was very comforting. The noodles were soft yet chewy. There was a good amount of chicken and vegetables. You can really taste the sweet savory soy sauce but again, it's not as spicy as I'm more used to."
,,,,,"This spot is the place to go for authentic Malaysian food.  Haven't tasted this authentic food in a long time, especially not in America. We got the char kuey teow and roti canai - SO GOOD. Food comes out piping hot straight off the wok. Makes me feel like I'm back home eating at a hawker stand. The kuey teow comes with authentic balachan chili paste and the roti is perfectly fluffy and chewy with AMAZING curry on the side. Owner is super friendly as well!! Definitely will be coming back with family and friends."
,,,,,They have a solid lunch special deal here. Lots of different options. Not stingy with the portion either. Everything is massive and delicious. For just $10!! Definitely a steal. Solid food and I would come back to try more dishes.
,,,,,"The owner was very welcoming and set up a table for us outside even though we arrived while they were still setting up. The service was quick and polite, and our food and drinks arrived quickly. Everything was delicious and was exactly what we were looking for."
,,,,,"This was a great experience! We had thought that they opened at 11:00, but once we got there they actually opened at 11:30. However, they were very accommodating and sat us anyway, which was very appreciated. Both the food (Thai Fried Rice and Pad See Eew) and drinks (Viet iced coffee and Thai iced tea) were very tasty, and we would definitely recommend."
,,,,,"super awesome and affordable restaurant! we ordered the pad Thai, beef pho, and curry clay pot and they were in great portions and super tasty! check this out if you have time!"
,,,,,soooo good!! the food is really authentic and the waiters are all super nice. i really recommend all the hot foods:)
,,,,,the pad sew eew with chicken was delish. it was devoured in minutes. i highly recommend this place.

,,,,,"This place had long been on my list of NYC must eats, and I finally got to try it out. We had to wait in line outside their Chelsea Market outlet, and it was pretty well managed by people who were making sure people are in the correct lines and are maintaining social distancing. I haven't seen much of that before but I feel it's good to have the restaurant take care of ensuring that customers are following Covid-19 guidelines, and it takes the burden off the customers to police others who are not complying. So kudos to them for doing that! Moving on to the tacos - I ordered a grilled chicken taco and a pork taco, which came with a side of lemon slice and chili. With the first bite itself I could feel the burst of flavors in my mouth - the sauces had the right amount of spice and tanginess, the tortillas were soft and the meat was grilled to a crisp yet tender perfection. And I love that each taco is very reasonably priced too, so you're sure to get your money's worth here. Would highly recommend and will visit again!"
,,,,,"Must visit location if you love tacos. Waited almost 45 minutes here and it was well worth it. My friends and I ordered the carne asada, pollo asado, adobada tacos, carne asada and pollo asado quesadillas. Wow flavors here are on point. Meats are well seasoned, condiments are fresh and service here is great. Prices are reasonable. I'd recommend ordering 3 tacos and 1 quesadilla to get a taste of everything. Expect to wait and seating here can be tight"
,,,,,"Been to this place twice now and must say it's some of the best tacos I've ever had. The guacamole on the asada tacos give them the perfect amount of substance. The Adobada tacos are definitely my favorite though, with an amazing flavor from the marinade and pineapple complimenting it on the top. The location in Chelsea market is a nice spot with a lot of other fun things going on. The price is the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars as it's a bit spendy. Highly recommend."
,,,,,My fav spot to get tacos when I go to New York. The carne taco is never dry it's always juicy which is good because I don't like dry tacos. They're drinks is good especially the Jamaica. But not going to lie the tacos a little bit pricy 4 something dollars for one taco. A little tip buy 2 quesadilla because it's more bigger and more cheaper and it have the same stuff like the taco has.
,,,,,"DELICIOUS tacos that have the option of being cheese-shelled!!! What this means is that instead of using a flour or corn tortilla, they make the tortilla out of cheese on the grill and shape it into the perfect vehicle for the meat and salsa. Located in Chelsea Market, this bustling taco shop is always packed and busy. Came here on a weekday afternoon with my bae and the line was almost going out the door! Service was thankfully super fast, and we got our tacos in no time. They came out bigger than your average tacos, which pleasantly surprised me since I'm used to smaller tacos."
,,,,,"We ordered a couple of tacos - Adobada and Carne Asada. We also ordered both with a cheese shell, which incurred a small extra charge. Both tacos were extremely delicious, with the meat being super tender and flavorful. The cheese shell was such a great upgrade from the regular boring flour/corn tortilla. The salsa and pico de gallo on top of the tacos were also complimentary for both tacos. "
,,,,,"The tacos here were great and the atmosphere was lively and communal - I definitely want to come back here someday! These tacos are a bit more expensive than your average priced tacos, but they are also bigger and they taste amazing. For anyone who visits Chelsea market, this is one of the places to try out!"
,,,,,Taco the talk. Walk the walk. 
,,,,,This place does it! Well maybe not a walk. After these you gonna wanna rest for a bit. Haha. 
,,,,,These tacos are so money!! The line is always bustling which is telling of a great restaurant. I always go for a taco and an especial which is the fried quesadilla. It's greasy. It's indulgent. It's something you just need sometimes. 
,,,,,Pro tip: they give you the receipt. Take it to the other side. Hand it over. Tell them what toppings you want. Add your salsas. And find a seat far far away so the people walking can stare longingly at your amazing food. Rinse. Repeat. You'll thank me.
,,,,,"Best tacos I've tried in the US so far.  I Tried the steak, pork, and chicken. Chicken taco is seasoned perfectly. Recipe should be framed in the louvre."
,,,,,"I'm bad when it comes to hype, but us Yelpers are a fickle bunch huh?  If something is hyped up to be good or if it's a new spot, we just need to be there."
,,,,,"Nevermind that in Las Vegas we have awesome taco stands in sketchy areas of town or El Gordo in the east side of Vegas as well, but Los Tacos popped up during my research of places to go to while in NY.  So while at Chelsea Market, I saw this long long line and I took a peak at what they were waiting for and I saw it was Los Tacos that was talked about on places to eat while in NY."
,,,,,"At any rate, the popular Los Tacos is just as good as some of the most popular places in Vegas."
,,,,,"So far closest flavor to real tacos from Mexico, both places at NYC are always packed bc flavor is just simply amazing. Every time I go to the city can't miss the chance to stop by midtown or Chelsea market to remember that Mexican flavor. Highly recommended."
,,,,,"Hi Ivan, thank you for reaching out and for the positive review. We are glad to hear you had a pleasant experience. Hope to see you soon!"
,,,,,"Fun order at the counter spot inside Chelsea market! Recently moved here from California and I'll be honest the Mexican food hasn't really compared, until I found these tacos! I ordered the pollo asada and carne asada tacos and they were delicious. They give you a ticket then you tell the guys on the line whether you want corn or flour tortilla and what toppings. Will be back!"

,,,,,"New York, NY 10019"
,,,,,"So I had a morning to explore and saw that Bibble and Sip opened up at 7:30AM. However, I did not find out until delving into reviews that what they are known for, their green tea and earl grey cream puffs, did not come out until noon. A little disappointed but I still wanted to try some B.S. (their abbreviation for themselves haha). I went for a lavender latte (4.50-$5 for hot depending on size), which is espresso steamed milk with lavender syrup. I should have also gotten a crossaint or something else but I had other dessert places on my list haha. The lavender stands out immensely and is other worldly, if that's a phrase haha. I enjoyed drinking this."
,,,,,I also got a black sesame + cookies and cream macaron which was shaped like Totoro. This was a bit heavier than I would expect from a macron and was just ok for me.
,,,,,They have a few limited tables here for you to sit and get the café feel but obviously not enough for the amount of foot traffic in here haha.
,,,,,I need to come back!
,,,,,I really am obsessed with this place. I wish they would put less cream as the puffs are a bit too fatty but the flavor is so on point. Yum!
,,,,,"Small cute desert shop with creative desserts oh and did I mention close to 5,000 reviews. Umm yes! I shall visit."
,,,,,"We arrived 15 mins before they closed the shop which we were happy we had speed walked. My boyfriend had the Black and White mousse cake and I had the black hazelnut. The portion was small no biggie but, flavorful with every bite. Worth the trip!"
,,,,,"My first impression is that this cafe is super cute. The pastries are adorable and carefully decorated, as you can see in the photos. We got two large cream puffs: one matcha and one earl grey flavored. They are so delicious! If I lived in New York, I would totally grab one of those for breakfast everyday. "
,,,,,"One of my only complaints is that the place is a tad too small to accomodate its large flow of visitors. As a result, I remember the experience to be slightly hectic and stressful since they're no place to sit and you have to constantly watch out for people so that you don't spill your drink. But perhaps it's just the time of day that I went (in the afternoon), maybe if you go at another time you won't have the same problem. "
,,,,,Another reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is that I thought the drinks were mediocre. I remember we didn't feel inclined to finish them even though there wasn't even much of the actual drink to begin with due to the large proportion of ice. 
,,,,,"Lastly, the name ""Bibble and Sip"" is pretty cute given that ""bibble"" means to eat or drink noisily! Overall, it's not perfect but I appreciate the novelty."
,,,,,cream puffs are great and oversized and exciting in their flavors.
,,,,,"but the service isn't. the waitstaff couldn't tell us what  all the allergens and ingredients in the cream puffs were, so my friend couldn't have one with me."
,,,,,Tuesday afternoon snack.
,,,,,"I've come here a few times prior specifically for the black sesame and earl grey cream puffs but today, I was in the area around lunch time and while heading back to work, decided to Treat Myself!! I also treated myself to a Praline latte that was quite  delicious and kept me caffeinated for the next 3 hours! "
,,,,,It's a bit frightening how close it is to my work and how I've been thinking about the other delights in the glass window. I've yet to try the cute macarons and the cloud dessert that looks so interesting. 
,,,,,"My only complaint is that it can get so crowded! Also, the staff this time was a bit rude/short. Could be a bit friendlier for such a cute cafe selling cute things!!"
,,,,,THESE CREAM PUFFS ARE A GIFT FROM HEAVEN
,,,,,I got the matcha and earl grey ones to go and ate them about 6hrs later... I was afraid that they were gonna get soggy but no!! They were still crispy on the outside and loaded with cream inside. It was packed with flavor and the sweetness was the perfect amount (Asian sweetness level). 
,,,,,Money well spent.
,,,,,Let me preface this review by saying: I have never loved an establishment more than I have loved Bibble & Sip.
,,,,,"Since I am a Chicago native, I have only had the pleasure of experiencing Bibble & Sip on trips to New York. My first encounter with Bibble & Sip was back in September of last year, when I had the iced Hong Kong Ducks for the first time. That drink instantly and unquestionably became my favorite iced coffee drink of all time, and I loved it so much that, well I bought a shirt immediately after."
,,,,,"My next encounters with Bibble & Sip were in the last week of March this year. Immediately as I got off the plane, my first stop on the subway was Bibble & Sip, luggage and all. I stayed in the east coast for 5 whole days this trip. Barring one day when I was in Boston for the entire day, I visited Bibble & Sip every single other day and spent well over $150-$200 while I was there, trying as much on the menu as I humanly could. Every single macaroon, cream puff, drink, etc... and after all of that, I'm both disappointed that I wasn't able to get EVERYTHING on the menu yet, but brimming with anticipation for my next trip to New York so that I can finish out the menu in its entirety."
,,,,,"To answer the question I know you're asking in your head, no, the entire menu does not total $200. However, I did also buy every single unique piece of merchandise they had - their coffee thermos, bag, hat, etc. - because I loved them so much. Plus, their merchandise selection isn't bad either. Shirts are super comfortable and the hats are cute. The thermos is probably the best thermos I own as well. The bag I bought probably has the least utility for me, but it would make a cute beach bag."
,,,,,"If there is such a thing as heaven on earth, it is Bibble & Sip. If there is such a thing as manna from heaven, it is one (or all) of these three items:"
,,,,,"1) The iced Hong Kong Ducks if you're in the mood for a cold coffee drink. I wasn't too big of a fan of the hot version of the drink (this is my sole critique so far, but I'm not much for hot drinks in general) but the iced version is PRIMO."
,,,,,"2) The iced Roseberry Float if you're in the mood for something fruity. This is honestly so delicious and the perfect blend of fruitiness and sweetness and is a good choice for a refreshing summer drink. Sadly I haven't been here in summer to verify that, but one day, I will be. It was good in the springtime as well... I'm sure it'll be great year round!"
,,,,,"3) ANY of the special desserts. I've tried nearly all of them aside from the big cakes. My favorite cream puff is probably the earl grey, as it's not too sweet so as to stuff me prematurely. A lot of people like the matcha, but it wasn't really for me. All of the macaron desserts were so beautifully and carefully designed, and super delicious. My favorite was the alpaca macaron. I honestly can't tell you what was in it, because I forgot. But trust me when I say it's delicious. There's also a small little gold chocolate cup decoration on it that served as a nice aftertaste for the rest of the macaron. I also tried the pig cake thing? Again, sorry for the poor naming. But that was also really good. Basically, anything is good."
,,,,,"My major critique would probably be the overcrowdedness of the cafe, but given the popularity, it's to be expected. The Little Italy location opened a while after I was there this year, so I haven't been able to experience it yet. Hopefully it helps ease up the congestion a bit."
,,,,,"You know what else would help ease up the congestion? A Chicago location. Please, Bibble. You guys would be so popular here if you were to open in Chinatown or even Wicker or Lincoln Park. Please, I'm begging you. I need you close to me, Bibble & Sip. I love you so much."
,,,,,Ahem. Anyway. This place is great. Five stars. Love it.
,,,,,A friend of mine recommended Bibble & Sip during my one week in NYC and I think I was here almost everyday! 
,,,,,"It's a cute little bakery in the Theatre District with cute, delicious baked goods and coffee/tea! "
,,,,,"CREAM PUFFS - WOW! I'm from LA and embarrassingly not a fan of Beard Papa's.. figured, I'm just not a cream puff kinda gal. I'm not sure what convinced me to try their matcha green tea puffs but man, I'm a believer now! These babies are heavenly. Not overpoweringly sweet and the crunch on the outside adds a great texture. Not to mention how BIG they are!!!! "
,,,,,"Lucky Hazelnut - Almost too cute to eat! Tiny chocolate cake with hints of hazelnut crunch.. Again, I'm not a fan of cake but this was good! It's like a ferrero rocher with cake consistency. I would definitely get this again! "
,,,,,"Yuzu fruit tart - I was not a fan :( I absolutely love fruit tarts and the yuzu flavor threw me off. Maybe it's my personal taste? But I'm just not a fan of sour, citrus fruit. I took one bite and threw it away. "
,,,,,"There were so many baked goods I wanted to try!!! If you have a sweet tooth, this is definitely the place to go! "
,,,,,Also ordered a matcha jasmine latte (never heard of that!) and loved it!
,,,,,"Came here for breakfast.We ordered the egg salad sandwich,black sesame almond stuffed croissant and a brown sugar latte.Everything is perfect.The egg sando is the best.We picked up a few desserts from here before and they tasted delicious .The people work here are very sweet and friendly.Definitely try this place."

,,,,,"New York, NY 10019"
,,,,,Probably one of the best halal food carts I've ever had in NYC! 
,,,,,Here's all you need to know:
,,,,,- Must visit while in NYC.
,,,,,- Chicken/Lamb over rice.
,,,,,- Go white sauce crazy!
,,,,,- Get some hot sauce if you love pepper sauce!
,,,,,- The lines move quick and for the price its worth it!
,,,,,Stop reading this and go snatch up a combo meal already! Enjoy folks and maybe I'll catch ya late night on the line for some banging halal eats!
,,,,,"falafel sandwich - This was so messy to eat. Delicious though. I asked for everything in it. And said yes to hot sauce, no to white sauce. (They put white sauce on it anyway, which I wasn't thrilled about.) "
,,,,,But the falafels were great. They are giant. So I feel like I am being healthier. Less space for the falfel soak up grease.. just let me pretend =).  Veggies were great. Bread was great.
,,,,,Price was great... Only $5. 
,,,,,"Long line, but it moved fast. A must try if you are in the area."
,,,,,"Cheap cheap and cheap !!$7 for a giant plate of rice and combo of meat and chicken and pita. A tasty $7 cheap eats ! Could never get this in hawaii for that price for sure maybe u ll be able to find something similar but not the same for $20 lol yes it's street food but when In New York u HAVE to get one ! And do not put more than like a drop of their hot sauce , FIRE straight FIRE do get plenty white sauce taste like yogurt and ranch dressing"
,,,,,"Boy oh Boy! Everyone knows this is the OG halal guys and I can definitely testify that this tastes significantly better than the ones on the west coast. Coming from California, I have made it an effort to stop by this stand at least once every time I happen to be in new york. So don't hesitate and make it an effort to stop by. It is conveniently located very close to the central park so take a stroll around the park and enjoy your food."
,,,,,"Glad to have finally made my way to the original spot, the combo rice plate was pretty good though possessing nothing that made it stand out in any way."
,,,,,"Somehow, I was under the impression that it was a combination of chicken and lamb...as it turned out, beef was the second meat.  I appreciated the chicken's tenderness, but the beef's bland greasiness quickly became overwhelming and too boring to finish.  The rice, however, was nicely seasoned and went well with the protein."
,,,,,"As for those infamous sauces, a little went a long way for both - the white tasted like seasoned mayo while the red's spiciness was mad potent even from just the smattering I laid over the plate."
,,,,,"Overall, the food here is without a doubt best eaten drunk or when one wants a hefty, quick meal without breaking the bank at all.  Otherwise, a single visit is more than enough."
,,,,,Every time I come to buy a bottle of the sauce the price changes... smh from $10 -a long long time ago- to $20
,,,,,Food still dry without the sauce so...
,,,,,"They don't stuff it as much as they used to.  And apparently now you can't put your own amount of sauce. They either give you packages or put it on for you....And you don't get both,  it's one or the other..... unless you pay them extra. Ohhh and the prices went up a dollar."
,,,,,Yesssssss! Lamb and chicken!
,,,,,Their hot sauce is by far the best!!!!
,,,,,"But be warned, it is very spicy!"
,,,,,"Hungry after being at the Top of the Rock for several hours, I Yelp'd what was close by and on my way to the Hilton, and this popped up. Sounded good to me, so off I went in search of foodie riches. Yep, it was every bit as delicious as everyone else has mentioned. Not only that, but it was generously portioned and CHEAP! Two things I do adore in my little frugal heart."
,,,,,"For a plate of food that cost around $7, it lasted me some 2.5 meals. Good flavor, quick service, delicious (not dry!) rice, tender, well-seasoned meat, and when I added that white sauce with a touch of the red spicy sauce? Sheeeeet, I was in culinary heaven. I'm going to be honest... Writing this right now is making me hungry, but unfortunately, I live quite a bit far from NYC. The food really is something I miss so much."
,,,,,"It was a great way to jump start my four days in the City, and my mini culinary tour I took while there. Seriously some of the best street food I've ever eaten."
,,,,,"These guys are a trip! One of them really made my day. He got 2 of my friends' orders, and then he gets to me and asks if I'm single! We had a great little talk as I ordered and he showered me with flattery and quite the ego boost (to be completely honest). What a trip! "
,,,,,"I got the gyro and chicken with rice. Wow it was yuuummy! Ask for extra white sauce, and if you can handle some heat, get their hot sauce too. It could be a little too spicy if you're weak, but it was really good for me. Not too spicy in my opinion, but gives good flavor and heat (for me personally). It comes with a bit of pita bread too! "
,,,,,"I am so glad they are coming to California! They're awesome, the food is plentiful and good, and the price is right."

,,,,,"Hi Fran, thanks for the 5-star review! We appreciate you taking the time out of your day to rate The Halal Guys."
,,,,,"Delicious! We got the chicken plate for $8 to share. The portion was huge. We same here after lunch time, so the wait wasn't long. There was still a line, though. They didn't provide any seating, so we in public seating near it."
,,,,,75 9th Ave

,,,,,"Finally got to try this place after having visited NYC a few times last couple of years.  Some of the best tacos I have tasted.  The carne asada and adobado had loads of flavor.  The seasoning was on point.  Ordering process is pretty efficient and the line moves quickly.  After ordering you give your ticket to one of the guys making the tacos.  They ask if you want corn/flour tortilla and if you want all the fixins (onion, cilantro, and guacamole).  They also have limes, radishes, and chili peppers on the counter if you want to add additonal toppings.  Well worth the effort to have a taco or two here.  You won't regret it."
,,,,,"I came here on a Thursday afternoon and tried the Carne Asada and Adobada (marinated pork) tacos. This location is inside Chelsea Market, but it's definitely not a tourist trap. It's awesome, authentic Mexican food that even the locals wait in line for. And this place is definitely worth the wait!"
,,,,,"You order at the cashier and they'll print out your ticket- move down the counter and give your ticket to the other guys, who are the ones who will make your tacos. They will ask you what kind of tortilla you want and if you want all the toppings (if you don't have any allergies, dietary restrictions- I'd go with ""everything"", which includes guacamole!) "
,,,,,Then you can add spices/herbs and salsas to your heart's desire and enjoy your tacos.
,,,,,I also got some horchata and they have a variety of other Mexican drinks to try as well!
,,,,,I got two Nopal tacos on a corn tortilla with all of the toppings. I came here solely due to the reviews. The line was very long! It did move quickly and they have their service down pat. 
,,,,,"Being a vegetarian, I'm sure I missed out on the other menu items which were probably delicious. The Nopal was good, but the texture was a little thick and meaty for my liking. It was all very fresh and I'm glad I tried it!"
,,,,,"Living on the west coast for the last 6 years, I've been privileged to have some of the best Mexican food. Los Tacos makes you believe that you're either in LA or Mexico. The tacos are  wet authentic. Everything from the corn tortillas to the tenderness of the carne asada. I love everything about this place. It's a must try if you're in NYC."
,,,,,"New York almost would be considered lacking in good Mexican cuisine if it wasn't for this collection of taco spots. I've tried a handful, maybe dozens, of other taco and Mexican joints in the city and they're average at best or straight garbage that not even the drunchies can save."
,,,,,Los Tacos No.1 does a lot of things right. First and foremost the tortillas are handmade and that factors more into a good taco than what's inside it. Salsas come next and they do a fine job of getting a good ratio of spice to acidity. Ive had all the meats (still need to try the nopales) and they are grilled just enough to give it that nice charred flavor and are well seasoned enough that they remain juicy and flavorful. 
,,,,,My one qualm about this place would be the adobada (pastor) could take on the pineapple flavor a little more. Maybe marinate longer or with something more concentrated with that pineapple sweetness.
,,,,,"HANDS DOWN BEST TACOS IN THE CITY. Coming from California, I found it hard to find good Mexican food in the city. However, these are the best tacos I've had in my entire life. I absolutely love the carne asada and chicken tacos so much; I still can't decide which one is better. I always get one of each:)"
,,,,,"Wow! This is a fun place to try out at Chelsea Market. Everything is so fresh, they make it in front of you. They are also very clear on their menu which items are vegan or contain lard. I think the corn tortilla did not contain lard or animal products. I had a chicken taco. It was excellent. You get to put some of your own toppings. There really isn't really a place to sit but there is a cart where you can stand. It's cool to watch everyone around you eating and enjoying."
,,,,,One of the best tacos in New York. This place deserves 5 for food 5 for service 5 for location!! Keep the great job !!
,,,,,Great great great!!  Their tacos r huge!! And so delicious.  I love doing my groceries at Chelsea market.....and if u do .... Stop by here end try those amazing tacos and the refrescos !!!  EXELENT concept . So refreshing!!!
,,,,,My favorite tacos I've had and being from Los Angeles I've eaten A LOT of tacos.  Honestly can't go wrong with any of their tacos here.  They are just the juiciest most flavorful tacos I've had.  
,,,,,I would wait in line for these for sure and that's not something I do often.

,,,,,"New York, NY 10028"
,,,,,Sprawling art museum in Central Park featuring masterpieces from around the globe.
,,,,,"I had a free evening in NYC on a summer Saturday and since they are open until 9 pm both Friday and Saturday I opted for a ""night at the museum"""
,,,,,Even arriving at 5 pm the place was busy although there were plenty of people on their way out.  I waited in a slow line to buy my ticket ($25) and rent an audio guide ($7)-definitely get the audio guide-although later noticed self-service kiosks scattered around the busy lobby that could have sped things up.
,,,,,"Your ticket is good for three days so you don't have to try and see it all in one visit.  The building is sprawling which encourages wandering which is what I did-I could never really figure out the map.  After an hour or two of art, I took the elevator to the fourth floor, and walked up the stairs to the roof-and had a drink at the open-air bar.  It was calm and peaceful up there and a nice spot for a break."
,,,,,"While the museum is filled with priceless treasures, my favorite sections were the European painting galleries-with lots of works by Monet, Picasso and other masters and the Roman and Greek collection with statuary and many artifacts."
,,,,,The special exhibits were also a treat.
,,,,,Three hours was about all I could handle and headed back to my hotel.  Abundant cabs are lined up at a cab stand right out front.
,,,,,Wanted to visit a museum in New York but wasn't sure which one would appeal to our entire group. In the end it was hot and The Met was the closest one so we went in to check it out.
,,,,,1. Ask for guidance at the info desk. This place is huge. 
,,,,,2. We used CityPASS and it was extremely easy and we skipped the lines. 
,,,,,3. Take the free highlight tour. It gives you a good feel for the museum. Taking the highlight tour allowed us to go back and visit what interested us the most. 
,,,,,The diversity of the collection is amazing and a great opportunity to expose you or your kids to some amazing art. Highly recommend!!!
,,,,,This place is huge. Like so huge you easily need to come here multiple times to get the whole thing. My only complaints is that there is nearly not enough seating around the exhibits (your back and feet will ache and I only spent 3 hours here) and the bathrooms were dirty for such a nice place. 
,,,,,"So many artifacts, so much art, and so much to learn about. Without a map you can easily get lost."
,,,,,One other complaint would be that some of the self serve kiosks seemed to malfunction.
,,,,,A must visit if your in nyc visiting or a local. The museum has so many different experiences for thee who loves history.
,,,,,"After exploring Central Park, I made my way the the Met museum. Walking towards the front entry there is a water fountain and many people sitting on the steps just soaking everything in."
,,,,,Once you walk through those glass double doors only to find that there is a security check to check your personal items. No water or bottles of any kind--must throw away or drink at your leisure before entry.
,,,,,"After all that is done and over with, you'll walk over to the queue to pay for admission. Admission is $25 for adults, $12 for students, and free for children under twelve that are accompanied by a paying adult. All the exhibition are included with every admission. I didn't have to worry about parking as I took the subway to Central Park and walked into the museum the good ole fashioned way."
,,,,,Open Seven Days a Week
,,,,,Sunday-Thursday: 10 am-5:30 pm*
,,,,,Friday and Saturday: 10 am-9 pm*
,,,,,Make sure to visit the rooftop where you can see an awesome view from up top. There is also a cafe if you're feeling parched or would like a bite to eat. Everyone friendly and helpful! No video or flash photography!
,,,,,"This is an amazing museum and sadly I have not been for some time. This review is for their large and comprehensive online store -- the merchandise is varied and unusual.  Some items can be pricey but they do have sales.  This past summer, I bought lovely items for my mother's birthday.  All were sent very quickly and securely.  The Met does has not disappointed me ever, and this continues."
,,,,,"Excellent museum, it has great works from around the world and it really is such a pleasure to spend your day exploring here. One of the best attractions of the city"
,,,,,"A New York icon on Fifth Ave and 85th street in the heart of the museum mile. The ""Met"" has an amazing collection of art from all over the world. Weather your taste runs from modern art to the renaissance you will find something to make you say ""wow""."
,,,,,The featured show on this visit was a fashion show inspired by Byzantine  art. The clothing was designed by modern designers and was displayed in the Gothic renaissance room at the Met. The fashions looked right at home among the art work. It is possible to get lost in this vast museum and I have on many occasions. There are plenty of museum workers on hand to help you find your way around.
,,,,,My favorite room to visit is the musical instrument gallery. As a musician I enjoy looking at all the vintage instruments. They have some amazing guitars and violins on display. This room alone is worth the price of admission.
,,,,,"Speaking of admission, please note that if you are a NY resident, just show your NY id and you can pay what you want for admission. For non New Yorkers the admission fee is $25 for the day. You can come and go as you please. The Met has a restaurant inside but it's very pricey and most visitors opt to go outside and buy lunch or snacks from the food vendors along 5th Ave. Tables and chairs are available to dining alfresco. The museum's gift shop is a great place to shop for unique gifts or a souvenir of your visit. Don't let the admission fee scare you away this place is worth every dollar no matter what you pay to get in."
,,,,,The Museum has been open for most of the past year. I have always felt safe going there as there were timed entry's. The present Goya and Alice Neel exhibit are fabulous!
,,,,,Pros: pay what you will for New York residents

,,,,,"OG halal, wonderful. Beware of red sauce. Take some probiotics before and or after if you're concerned. Otherwise, take that bad boy into Central Park to enjoy a day with the sparrows, or just chow down on the conveniently placed curb. "
,,,,,Doesn't get much better than this for a happy $8.
,,,,,The falafel was hard and dry on the outside but delicious on the inside. Perfect blend is sauce mixed with lettuce and pita. SO CHEAP! Quick service and clean cart.
,,,,,"Hi Cindy, thank you for the positive comments. We are so happy you enjoyed your meal at The Halal Guys and look forward to seeing you again!"
,,,,,"Personally I love the Halal Guys, the food is great, price is fair, and they serve food fast. So as usual I went to get some Halal Guys for dinner and when I was eating, I felt something sharp in my mouth. I thought maybe it's a chicken bone so I spit it out, and fair enough, it's a piece of GLASS. Not saying the food is bad, but I probably won't go back for a long time due to this health hazard."
,,,,,Good street food but I can't say it's anything special or different from the hundreds of other street carts in NYC
,,,,,"Hi Paige, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about The Halal Guys! We are happy to have you as a customer!"
,,,,,huge fan.
,,,,,the cart is open late
,,,,,"inexpensive, and you get a lot for your money"
,,,,,the line can get out of control at times but well worth the wait.
,,,,,"be careful with the hot sauce, it'll burn your mouth to death."
,,,,,the workers are kinda rushed and rude but thats because its always so busy.
,,,,,the cart is like a well oiled machine.
,,,,,the bbq sauce and hot sauce containers look similar so please be careful.
,,,,,best chicken and rice cart in NYC by a long shot.
,,,,,"TL, DR: Big portions on the cheap, but DRY and bland. There are better eats - food trucks included - in NYC!"
,,,,,"I've had The Halal guys bookmarked even before I knew I was heading to NYC.  I saw the Check-Ins, the reviews, and thought ""Wow, this place seems AMAZING; everyone loves it!  IF I'm ever in NYC...""   So when I actually DID go to NYC, of course I made a pilgrimage to The Halal Guys. "
,,,,,I ordered:
,,,,,Chicken/rice
,,,,,"The rice was bland.  The chicken was so DRY - and it was freshly made, because I stood in line watching/waiting for nearly 10 minutes - but I guess that explains the need for so much sauce! The coveted white sauce was just OK: it had a mayo flavor I wasn't expecting and wasn't crazy about. The pita was alright."
,,,,,Falafel (5 of 'em)
,,,,,These were the damn butteriest falafel I've ever had. Too bad they were lukewarm and on the dry side. There was no semblance of spice.
,,,,,"My total, without a drink, was $9. "
,,,,,"The one upside? HOLY MASSIVE PORTIONS! I hadn't eaten in 7 hours, so was starrrvinggg, but barely finished 1/4 of the chicken/rice.  I saved the leftovers, telling myself that I'd eat them, but kept putting it off. Needless to say they ended up in the garbage bin. "
,,,,,"Look, I know there's a cult following.  I just... I just don't get it."
,,,,,"I'm sure it would be a great post-bar option (what with the portion size, starch, and dryness), but I wasn't drinking.."
,,,,,There are so many other options in NYC: why waste it on mediocre chicken and rice?
,,,,,"Literally so fire. i go to the guy on 72nd street with the mustache.  I got the chicken and lamb platter and was FULL FULL. the hot sauce is hot as a son of a bitch, but delicious."
,,,,,Hi Kevin! Thank you so much for providing your feedback. We are happy to hear you have enjoyed your experience with us and appreciate all of your support. We look forward to your next visit. 
,,,,,The Halal Guys
,,,,,Went Monday at 1pm. No lines at all. Decided to get the combo. Everything was fresh and warm. Food is what you expect from a food cart! 
,,,,,There's really no tables or anything just a few benches that are attached to some planters. Always have pigeons around so it gets annoying to eat out here but still worth coming!
,,,,,"By far this is the best street cart food in NYC. I've tried others and none compare. They give good quantity of food and have reasonable prices. Oh yeah... did I say how amazing the food is? This also explains why they always have long lines at their corners. If you like some fire, try their hot sauce. I've been here twice already and plan to go back atleast one more time this weekend. Enjoy!!!"
,,,,,Wow I really miss this place! One of my favorite places in NY to eat.  I came here around midnight and there was barely a line.  Maybe cause it was raining but still.  THIS IS A MUST IF YOU ARE IN NY.  Make sure you get the right truck.  
,,,,,6 dollars gets you a bowl of heaven.  You get so much food for such a small price.  I'm coming back for you guys in a week!!!
,,,,,PS I think they put crack in their sauce....

,,,,,"New York, NY 10019"
,,,,,"The Halal Guys are ultimate. Nothing more I can say that the thousands of recommendations already. Basic menu, super tasty food. Authentic halal - not the many other food trucks around new York. Check out the yellow hoodies, these people are authentic ones. "
,,,,,Best thing - super cheap - $7 for the platter and $5 for the sandwich roll. The huge portions can't get any cheaper anywhere. 
,,,,,Remember - cash only. They like keeping it simple.
,,,,,"-Portions for platter are huge, you will be super full."
,,,,,-There is no seating ofcourse because it's a good truck. Get your food go home and eat or you can find a few places around there that have benches where you can sit and eat - this might be harder when the weather is cold.
,,,,,"The white sauce - I guess it's mayo, it's wonderful. "
,,,,,"Taste is incredible. You are in new York and you haven't tasted Halal Guys, your visit isn't worth it. Anyways New York is known for its good scenes and good trucks. I would say prefer the platter, coz it comes with meat, rice, salad and the naan plus the Halal Guys marked packaged white sauce. "
,,,,,"Also, these people are super friendly and everyone loves them. You can see them prepare the hot food at the other nearby truck. Must try and you would keep going back to them."
,,,,,These guys have a line around the corner and literally five trucks in one block but I'm saying so you will be using the bathroom after that LOL
,,,,,"Hi Mary, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about The Halal Guys! We are happy to have you as a customer!"
,,,,,"Had it to go.  It was as good as I remember and surprisingly still busy at 3 pm in the afternoon.  The line moved fast with just a few people ahead of me but a lot of patrons eating on the street nearby.  It's a NYC staple.  When in town, this place is a must.  It appears they have now opened up a few brick and mortar restaurants around the city as well across the US.  The waiting in line and eating outside experience cannot be substituted.  Until next time..."
,,,,,"Believe it or not, my friends were not exaggerating when they said that you MUST have this when you're in New York! A friend of mine would drive here from Philly just to get the chicken and rice then make her way back home. I was surprised when we first came here as I was expecting a restaurant but it was just a food cart. There were multiple stands around the block filled with long lines. We waited about five minutes and they only take cash. Of course, I had to get the famous chicken and rice. This was AMAZING!! the white sauce was SO good! even though I'm not sure what it was. For $7.50, the amount of food was generous. Everyone actually stands around or sit on random places to eat as there are no designated areas.  I definitely will be stopping by every time that I visit New York. This is a must"
,,,,,"So I'm going to be ""that person"" that is the only one who wasn't ""blown away"" by halal guys."
,,,,,"Is it good? Yes, it is tasty for a quick bite when walking by. Would I seek out halal guys after trying it? No. Would I wait in line for it? No. Do I want to try anything else there? Not really"
,,,,,"Got the gyro sandwich - I found it to be overly salty, and in need of something sweet/pickled or acidic to cut the overall strong ""fat"" taste of everything. The bread was great though. "
,,,,,Can I just buy the bread?
,,,,,Won't try it again. Sorry
,,,,,Delicious New York City Street Halal food --now available in stores around the city making it utterly far more convenient
,,,,,"Hi Oz, thanks for the 5-star review! We appreciate you taking the time out of your day to rate The Halal Guys."
,,,,,"Whenever I'm in the area I always order the combo of lamb and chicken. The dish is flavorful and satisfying. I mean come on, $7 for delish food that can feed two? Sign me up!"
,,,,,"Make sure you go easy on their hot sauce though because it's hot! And when I say hotttt, it's not 4 American chili peppers hot."
,,,,,There the halal guys and there business is booming just like the fresh tast of there lamb they fast and effective so if your in town looking to get a great taste of the city come to the halal guys you wont be disappointed
,,,,,"Hi Essence, Thank you for reviewing The Halal Guys. We appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback."
,,,,,This is one of my favorite foods. This halal cart is the best among all halal carts in NYC and I've tried a bunch.
,,,,,There are two carts. One that comes out after 7pm across from the Hilton (the original location) and another cart that opens earlier on the other side of 53rd st. at 10am. Both carts taste the same to me.
,,,,,"For some reason the line is longer for the cart across from the Hilton. I don't know why, but my only guess is that its because its the original location. There is more turnover there, so the food may be a smidge fresher."
,,,,,"The most popular options here are the combo (chicken and lamb over rice) and the chicken over rice. Both are $6 and include a small side salad. I've tried the combo, which is good, but i prefer the chicken over rice. The flavor of the rice is awesome. The portions are large and are enough to feed two. Drench it with white sauce and drizzle it with hot sauce. Yum, so tasty!"
,,,,,Everything I hoped it would be!
,,,,,"I had the gyro platter. Tons of delicious meat, flavorful rice and soft & warm pita. The white sauce is amazing and adds so much to the plate. The red is liquid fire, so use it carefully!"
,,,,,"Extremely fast service and great prices - $16 for a gyro sandwich, gyro plate and 2 cans of soda."

,,,,,The wait was very quick. We were served immediately with friendly service. The noodles came in gigantic bowls. The flavors were alright. Nothing really popping or special. Tasted like any noodle you could make to me. 
,,,,,The ambiance of the place was very casual. It had dim lighting and a lot of decorations around.
,,,,,The noodles it self was aight but the brooth was pretty good. It didnt meet my expectations due to the hype but it was good tho dont get me wrong. Broth was flavorfull and egg could have been more marinated compared to some other ramen spots ive tried before. For the price ive been to better spot. It was good to try. Maybe ill try something else next time
,,,,,Hands down one of the best ramen spots in NYC. Ippudo NY does not take reservations but we were able to get seated after 10 minutes for two on Sunday. We were lucky because there is usually a swarm of people are outside the restaurant waiting to get seated. We sat on a communal table. Big groups should beware as it will be hard to get seated together. 
,,,,,"Once you walk in, the staff yells out a loud welcoming greeting. You tend to get these greetings at the ""real"" Japanese joints. "
,,,,,"Akamaru Modern $15.00 ($2.00 nitamago, $3.00 Takana) - The Tonkotsu pork broth is out of this world! The ingredients are fresh as well as its house-made thin noodles. For an extra $2.00 you can add an extra serving of noodles by calling out ""Kae-Dama."" This was my original plan, but because the broth was so good, there was not much left for another serving of noodles. "
,,,,,"Pork Hirata Buns $9.00 - Very savory, fatty, and tender pork buns.  They were amazing--highly recommended!"
,,,,,"It's a bit pricey, but the experience was exceptional and authentic. Don't let the crowd become an obstacle for Ramen heaven!"
,,,,,"First and foremost, expect a LONG wait. Ippudo doesn't take reservations, and it's a very LA style wait time - put down your name, eat something elsewhere as a snack, and then finish off your night with Ippudo."
,,,,,"We came here for my brother's birthday and had several of the appetizers and the ramen, of course. I got the pork belly with the noodles cooked the Japanese equivalent of ""al dente""."
,,,,,"The ramen was fair, but it definitely didn't live up to its hype. I feel like my homemade ramen has a richer taste, but that's just me. Additionally, while the appetizers were tasty, they were supremely overpriced, as were their noodles. I think this is one of those places you go to to be seen/say you've been moreso than to actually enjoy fine dining."
,,,,,"How the mighty have fallen. Back in '08, it was mainly to go to ippudo or momofuku. Now the ramen scene has really blossomed in NYC."
,,,,,"Food here is just not good anymore but the lines continue to be massive. Ordered a tuna appetizer, it was close to not edible. The goma Q (cucumber) was ok, a little over salted. But the most disappointing part was by far the ramen."
,,,,,"Ordered the akamaru + a miso special they had. Broth was watery for both, and the temperature wasn't even hot. "
,,,,,TLDR version: disappointing.
,,,,,Came by for dinner the other night as this is the most reviewed restaurant in NY. The wait for dinner was merely ~15 minutes as they mainly have communal tables here. There is a full bar in the waiting area.
,,,,,"The entire restaurant feels like a club with the dim lighting, hip hop playing in the background along with some pretty flamboyant staff?!?"
,,,,,"Started off with the pork buns that both the waitress and Yelpers were raving about. It was okay. The buns were very fluffy, almost identical to Peking Duck buns. The pork belly's sauce was too strong and the meat wasn't super tender. The lettuce that they used was too close to the core... something not expected for a Michelin 2013 recommended and 2014 Zagat rated restaurant."
,,,,,"The Akamaru ramen that both the waitress and Yelpers suggested was also okay. The soup was good, not too oily or rich. The noodles were pretty al dente. Requested the boiled egg and pork belly as add-ons and they were both okay."
,,,,,Service was also slightly spotty for a Michelin recommended restaurant.
,,,,,Dinner after tax and tip was ~$33/person.
,,,,,Ippudo is one of those places where you know it going to be good. The real doubt is whether or not it's the best you've ever had. 
,,,,,"Ippudo is located on 4th Avenue between 9th and 10th Street. They don't take reservations, however provided you get there at opening, you shouldn't expect any particular delay. "
,,,,,The decor is sophisticated and proves to be a good environment to hang out and eat with a beer or two. 
,,,,,"The ramen I ordered was the shiomaru (i.e. Salt). Savory ramen was well done, and I would certainly have this again. That said, this won't fill you up. Consider a side dish also; I went with soft-shell crab. "
,,,,,"Ippudo enjoys a very loyal following, generating buzz from foodie sites and magazines, influencers and the like. Consider that this is only one out of a massive group of ramen shops that equal the quality and taste that I saw here. However, there's only a few that exceed the food that is on offer here."
,,,,,"Very good overall, however ramen-eaters should consider Ippudo as merely the standard at which they measure against other places. Anything less, consider it trash. Anything better deserves massive praise."
,,,,,"This is a wonderful divey spot with groovy music (very discouraging inspired) and dim lighting.  A nice after work gathering spot agmonst friends.  Make a reservation because the wait is very long. Also, ask for extra protein in your Ramen and an egg on the side. Don't worry if protein isn't your thing, there's a vegetarian side of the menu."
,,,,,"This is one of my family's favorite ramen restaurants. Every time we're in NY we always make a point to stop here. We arrived around 6:30pm with a party of 5 and had to wait about an hour which ended up not being too bad as we ordered drinks and the best shishito peppers!!  We then got seated (they needed our full party to be there and NO add-ons to the party) and ordered the pork buns and bbq wings. I still dream about those two appetizers. Incredible. So much flavor and goodness. I got the modern bowl and added a boiled egg and ate every last bite/slurp of it. As always, extremely pleased with the food and everything in between!"
,,,,,"Ippudo is up there in good nyc ramen. Always good service, great ramen, great sake options, their house negori is my go to. good ramen is good ramen, sometimes long waits and priced a bit high for ramen, but its solid"
,,,,,65 4th Ave
,,,,,"New York, NY 10003"
,,,,,"Is it weird that I look forward to going back to NYC just so I can eat here again? No? Okay, cool."
,,,,,"I suggest looking over the menu while you wait because it can be overwhelming if it's your first time. Unless you plan to show up solo, don't come here when you're already hungry because 1) you'll most likely have to wait anywhere between 30-90 minutes depending on how busy it is and 2) by that time you'll want to order every fricking appetizer like I wanted to. We were told 60-90 minutes for our party of three but, luckily, we were called back and seated within 40 min. "
,,,,,"We ordered the brussel sprouts with bacon and the pork belly baos for appetizers. Both great choices and both cooked really well. The thick tangy sauce that was used on the bao was strong in flavor which was balanced well with the lettuce (pero like, why is the lettuce cut like a wedge). The brussel sprouts & bacon went exactly as you would expect it to... I mean it has bacon in it - nuff said!!"
,,,,,"The soup base of the Akamaru Modern isn't salty which is clutch because the salt hand is strong in other ramen spots, which ruins the actual flavor of the broth. Ippudo's broth is simple (but tasty!) enough to absorb the flavors of everything in the bowl instead of the other way around."
,,,,,"Ippudo is my favorite ramen spot of all time. This was my first time at this location and even though I arrived during lunch hours, there was barely a wait. The food arrived quickly and the service was impeccable. I ordered the classic and as always, the noodles were flavorful and the broth was perfect."
,,,,,"Hands down, best ramen in NYC! I have been going to this place for years, everything is so savory and delicious! "
,,,,,"If you like spicy I suggest the Karaka-men, it's amazing (if you're vegetarian you can opt for the one without pork or other veggie-based options). I always get the pork buns as an appetizer, but the chicken buns are equally as good. But they have a lot more appetizer selections to choose from. "
,,,,,"The only downfall about Ippudo is the wait and first come, first serve policy. They do not take reservations and you can wait up to an hour, sometimes even up to two hours, as this place is ALWAYS busy. BUT I promise you that it's definitely worth every minute of the wait - it's that good! And after patiently waiting - one of my favorite things about this place is the lively atmosphere and the huge Japanese welcome you receive from all of the staff as you're guided to your seat/table. As soon as you take a seat, the staff is attentive to your every need. It's definitely a unique dining experience and one worthy of checking out."
,,,,,"Got here as soon as they opened on a bright summer Sunday morning with some friends. Oh my goodness, what the hell is all the yelling about!!  I understand that's their way of greeting customers as soon as they walk through the door, but the yelling continues throughout your entire stay. Intriguing at first, but then a distraction throughout the dining experience. "
,,,,,"Honestly, Ippudo was my first Ramen and Pork Belly bun experience. We had the pork buns first, I didn't know what to expect but I thoroughly enjoyed them, but since this experience I have had much better pork buns IMO. The Ramen with pork belly and a poached egg was a big bowl of flavorful, hearty, warm, soothing, slurpiness full of goodiness, that I could not finish. I really wanted to take what I had left to go, which was a lot, but I was told that you can't take the ramen to go. I was disappointed, but I understood that the texture wouldn't be the same once warmed up later. I felt guilty leaving so much food to be thrown out...such a waste. Wish they had smaller bowls so I can eat every last drop and not be so wasteful. "
,,,,,"I'm glad I had my Ippudo experience, it's now time to move on and try out one of the many other Ramen spots...On to the next one!"
,,,,,"Well thought out menu with great flavors to choose from. One of the best noodle balls I have had, great texture and flavor. My favorite was the spicy broths that taste great when they serve it. No having to add lots of stuff to get the flavor."
,,,,,"I have been to 15+ ramen shops (family owned or chains) and Ippudo ramen is my least favorite. When I first moved to NYC years ago, my friend raved about Ippudo. Thus I went to Ippudo Westside and it was just okay. After a recent visit to Ippudo NY, the verdict is in: meh. "
,,,,,Pros:
,,,,,1. Broth is smooth and not overly salty
,,,,,2. Accept credit card ($10 minimum)
,,,,,3. Many servers (or floaters) to accommodate your requests
,,,,,Cons:
,,,,,1. Straight thin noodles for all ramen bowls except the wasabi one. I personally prefer wavy medium/thick noodles. The fact that they don't substitute does not make sense for the NYC market because so many other ramen shops offer this flexibility
,,,,,"2. Portion was way too small. I don't mind paying $17 a bowl but at least fill it up to the top. Hey, at least it is better than Ivan Ramen Slurp Shop where they only fill your bowl to the 50% mark. Here, they fill up the bowl to the 57% mark. It is a whopping 7% more in portion size. Plus, the broth spoon was way too large (when compared with its portion size) and very awkward to use"
,,,,,3. No corn topping? Shouldn't that be a standard when it comes to ramen? At least offer it on the menu under additional topping choices
,,,,,"4. I thought poached egg in ramen would be novelty and tried it. Nope, didn't like how it was extremely runny "
,,,,,5. Thanks for the complimentary tea at the very end but this random floater didn't even bother telling me what kind of tea it was before slamming it down in front of me?
,,,,,"Keep in mind I have very particular preferences when it comes to my ramen. My 2-star review should not stop you from coming here. In fact, (if you don't care that much about how your ramen is made) you *SHOULD* come here just to see if this place lives up to the hype or to your standard. It didn't for me. I won't be back and they wouldn't need my business anyway."
,,,,,Tips:
,,,,,"1. There is always a wait. They do, whoever, use a texting system to notify you when your table is ready"
,,,,,"2. They accommodate groups as large as 8 - 10 people. If you come in pairs, be prepared to sit in a community table"
,,,,,3. They only give sanitary wipes if you order the pork buns. Shouldn't sanitary wipes be available to everyone?
,,,,,"4. Food comes out almost immediately (about 5 - 10 minutes). If you are expecting to have a long deep conversation with your friend or date, this is not the spot"
,,,,,"This was my first experience with Ramen... which I was able to indulge in due to the Option to order vegetarian broth. It was packed with flavor and for $20 dollars you can really load up your Ramen. They offer a lot of appetizers that are vegetarian and also cater to the carnivores. The eggplant mushrooms buns are amazing soft and fluffy! Staff is really on point and are constantly filling up your glass with water, and asking you if you need anything else. The french fry appetizer is insane and packed with so much flavor. I highly recommend the french fries, vegetarian buns, and the Ramen with a poached egg. Make sure you save some broth to order for an extra two dollars more noodles. We went on a Saturday night and the wait was only around 10 minutes."
,,,,,"I've traveled to Tokyo, Los Angeles, Seoul and many other different cities and had some of the best ramen in the respective cities. Ippudo definitely is on par with those and then some. Of all the ramen restaurants in NYC this is definitely my favorite. Be expected to wait but kick back and have a beer while you wait. "
,,,,,"As an appetizer their chicken karage, and buns are amazing. The chicken karage isn't too greasy and is fried and seasoned perfectly. I always get the pork hirata buns."
,,,,,"As for ramen I've tried their classic which is a safe go to if it is your first time here. I always like to try a ramen restaurants classic tonktotsu ramen to really be able to taste their broth. Their broth is very smooth and has a less greasy consistency that other shops. After eating you won't have the bloated, greasy feeling. You can tell that they put the time and effort to make their broth each and every day. "
,,,,,"Last time I was here I ordered the Akamaru Modern which takes their tonkotsu broth and adds a ""Umami Dama"" miso paste that adds another flavor to the broth. It's actually my new favorite now. It had a more garlic and umami flavor that is to die for. "
,,,,,"You can always add more toppings whether it be a packed egg, more meat, corn, and etc. if your still not full after your first serving of noodles you can always order more! "
,,,,,Hands down my favorite ramen restaurant to go to in NYC
,,,,,"I can recall so many times when I see people waiting on hella long lines outside of a restaurant, or those new shoe releases, and think... what a waste of time.. "
,,,,,"Ippudo Ramen, is one of the few cases where the food, is well worth that wait."
,,,,,"Which brings me to my first tip... PLAN ACCORDINGLY.  If you're coming in during lunch or Thurs-Sun evenings, expect a line, please. "
,,,,,"People of NYC, consider yourself very lucky to have Ippudo in your territory.  Being that it's the first overseas chain of Ippudo, it's pretty much a vortex that takes you straight to Japan.  "
,,,,,"I mean, you walk in, and are greeted by these polite hosts/hostesses who then take you into the main dining room where everyone is seemingly yelling at you in Japanese, but don't worry, they're just happy to have you there and enjoy their food."
,,,,,"Decor:  Like I've said in my previous reviews about Ramen houses... I've never been to an actual ramen house in Japan, so all my ""ramen-house"" references come from animes.  "
,,,,,"Ippudo does a great job of combining traditional Japanese with the modern & sophisticated look we NYC foodies are accustomed to.  From the bamboo, to the stone counters, to the Japanese-style light fixtures, down to the wooden tables,, over-sized ramen bowls and the cool chopsticks that I really wanted to take home :D"
,,,,,Food:  
,,,,,Pork Buns! (2 for $9)
,,,,,Super fluffy buns w/ some tender pork chasu inside.  The sauce it's dressed with is also very yummy!  I think there was some sort of wasabi mayo inside as well.  Get these if you're extra hungry today :D
,,,,,Hirata Chicken Wings (3 for $7)
,,,,,"I think they used the same sauce for the pork buns pork on these wings.  They were good, but I could do without them next time."
,,,,,Akamaru Modern ($15) + Nitamago/Soft-Boiled Egg ($2)
,,,,,"Absolutely delicious.  In my opinion, it's great as it is.  But if you decide you want to add some more things to it, all their toppings have amazing umami flavor and won't take away from that savory pork broth.  The egg, for me, is a nice touch and a MUST because it's like a little break from the noodle and broth slurping; and speaking of noodles, they're perfectly cooked and easy to eat so SLURP AWAY.  Also, don't forget to mix everything together first, and to make sure a good amount of broth is in each bite! Why would they give you a huge spoon, so you can stuff it with noodles? That's what the chopsticks are for! Here let's break it down.."
,,,,,-Mix everything together
,,,,,-Take your chopsticks and pick up desired amount of noodles.
,,,,,"-SLURP! Don't backwash, that's gross even if it's your own bowl.."
,,,,,-follow it up with a spoonful of that delicious pork broth
,,,,,-Make sure to eat more of the noodles than the broth
,,,,,"-finally, tip the rest of that broth and leftover toppings into your mouth"
,,,,,-enjoy a wonderful rest of your day.
,,,,,"Service:  Pretty great!  Water cups were always refilled, had people checking up on us,= (not too often either)"
,,,,,"Also, not everyone in there is a Japanese employee so making it a policy/tradition for employees to learn basic greetings in Japanese is refreshing."
,,,,,"Yes, the reviews don't lie. This place is yummy. "
,,,,,Tried to go 3 times and the line was redic first 2 times so we came back when they opened at 11am and there was already people lined up. Third time's a charm!
,,,,,We got seated right away and these people are hustlers. You can tell they know how to get people in and out quickly. Time is money after all. So expect fast and borderline pushy service. 
,,,,,They have 1 vegetarian ramen option w a shoyu (soy sauce) and wasabi base with chewy noodles. It was pretty good. You can add other things for about $2 more. And kae-dama (more noodles) for $2. 
,,,,,"So this tally can really add up. $20+ for 1 bowl of ramen  ! To me, this is redic but I suppose it has that NYC upcharge. "
,,,,,Noodles were different in my ramen than my fiancés. Mine were thicker and more chewy and more traditional. If thats the way you prefer your noodles then you might want to request the ones that come with the vegetarian instead.
,,,,,Also tried the shisito peppers which were good and some were pretty spicy. 
,,,,,Ambiance is pretty cool and would be good for a date or groups. 
,,,,,Don't go during busy times and be prepared to spend the most you've ever had on ramen. Happy slurping!

,,,,,"Best Ramen! Came all the way from Chicago just to have this ramen.... pork was super tender and flavorful. Ramen broth not salty al all and also super flavorful! Everyone was super nice, friendly and would come to our table every 5-10 min to ask if we needed anything else. Pork buns to die for, best pork buns I've ever tasted. I'll for sure be back soon!"
,,,,,"A 5 minute wait, delicious ramen, and friendly service! The noodles were cooked perfectly. I will have to go back to try other items on the menu."
,,,,,"WOW! WOW! WOW! Very very good ramen! I came here on a cold Saturday morning at 10:30am. There are several locations but at this one people start to line up around 10:40am on Saturdays. I suggest you come around that time. Once the restaurant opens up the line will move quick. It should be noted that the hostess will not seat you if your entire party is not there, even with a reservation. When i sat down, i quickly ordered the spicy ramen and a Pork Bun. First with the Pork Bun... It was cooked PERFECT and the flavors were great! I highly highly recommend this to anyone who comes here. Second the ramen. OH WOW, this is just amazing! YOU HAVE TO TRY IT! I would highly recommend Ippudo NY to anyone looking for great ramen!"
,,,,,"I would rate Ippudo NY as follows:  Food (non ramen) is 5 Stars, Ramen is 5 Stars, Price is 4 Stars, Service is 4 Stars and Atmosphere is 5 Stars. "
,,,,,"The views expressed are of my own and are my true personal experience at this establishment. My personal experience may not reflect this actual establishment, their quality or someone else's experience at the establishment."
,,,,,"Hands down, THE best ramen I've had, yet (no I've never been to Japan so there's that..). Friend and I decided to give it a go on a cold winter afternoon, knowing that it'll be a hit or miss since it was nearing their closing time for lunch hour. We were told that they're closing in the next 20 minutes, and we're welcome to wait and see if any seats open up - but no guarantee. We decided to wait, and 5-10 minutes in, we got a table!!"
,,,,,"It was my friend's first time trying ramen at a restaurant and my fourth ramen shop, and this was one of the rare times when the hype did not disappoint. From the texture of the noodle to the perfectly seasoned and cooked ajitsuke tamago (soft boiled egg) to the flavor to the broth to the thickness of the broth and I can go on and on and on about the perfection that was so unreal that two years later, after having tried a handful more ramen shops in Cali and Texas, Ippudo is still my favorite ramen bar. And I don't like doing favorites."
,,,,,Even their service was top-notch. I didn't get any feeling that we were being rushed. 
,,,,,It's now become a staple in the NY food scene so do give it a go if you can spare time for the line or to try your luck! [;
,,,,,Food: 5
,,,,,Vibes: 5
,,,,,Staff: 5
,,,,,"Amazing ramen, accommodating for vegetarians. Have been going here for years."
,,,,,Best to put your name down and do something else for 2 hours while you wait (my choice: browse books at Strand).
,,,,,Never disappoints.
,,,,,My current favorite Ramen place in Manhattan. They have a lot of veggie options with a veggie broth which is hard to find in many ramen places. Their ramen is so flavorful and tasty. I visit their place once a month at least. Too good. They always have atleast 30 min wait time on a Friday evening or weekends. But worth the wait time. They usually don't take reservations so just come in put in your name. You will not regret it.
,,,,,M S G house alert. 
,,,,,This is such a horrible msg house ramen place. 
,,,,,This is totally horrible. I order the spicy pork ramen and all the soup contain a lot of msg and make u feel thirsty. 
,,,,,The service was very bad and the person took our order and just leave and until we left and we did not see her . 
,,,,,Not recommend 
,,,,,Not come back
,,,,,"Gotta give it to Ippudo, been there as a tower figure in NYC and is still there."
,,,,,"The seasonal menu is a hit or miss, but hey they are actually trying new things. "
,,,,,The classic menu is just always good. 
,,,,,The most reliable ramen place in New York City.
,,,,,Ippudo was as delicious as it was an experience.
,,,,,It was an impromptu decision to finally try this hyped ramen spot out on a Sunday evening. 
,,,,,"As others have said, get here earlier. Early as in 5:30p to avoid a long wait time, although you'll probably still end up waiting for 45 minutes."
,,,,,"We were seated at the high top tables overlooking the chefs at work, and it was amazing to see all of the dish preparations. Lots of energy and precision."
,,,,,"We started off with the infamous pork buns, because, pork buns. They were incredible. Soft, slightly sweet steamed buns filled with glazed, fatty pork and crunch lettuce. Simple and delicious. Also tried the octopus with fried potatoes, although I don't remember the actual name of the dish. The octopus had just the right amount of chew."
,,,,,"For the ramen, I had the popular Akamaru Modern. The broth had depth of flavor, and the pork just melted in your mouth. The noodles were also cooked perfectly. This was such a special dish, at a price point that doesn't break the bank, either. Skip out on the pickled mustard leaves though, for an extra $3.00, they didn't add much."
,,,,,"Wonderful experience, and would highly recommend to anyone visiting or local."
,,,,,"The food was amazing. The service however, was not."
,,,,,"Server with the half blonde, half black hair made petty political comments at my little brother, who's home for the holidays before touring in Afghanistan. Very bold to insult an American soldier while he's eating dinner with his family. Complete lack of respect. Someone should remind him he works in customer service & makes his money off his manners."

,,,,,What We Ordered
,,,,,- Square Potato Knish
,,,,,- Matzo Ball Soup
,,,,,- Pastrami Sandwich
,,,,,"Our first time at Kat'z was really something. Don't come here with a million bags and trying to order at the counter. It is a shit show if you order from the counter. I suggest you get a table. Bags or not, it's easier for tourists to just sit down instead of trying to figure out that mess of a crowd (where are these lines they speak of?)"
,,,,,Square potato knish was like a fried mashed potato square. Good snack while you wait for the Pastrami. Matzo Ball Soup was really good! But it was my first time having it so I have nothing to compare it too.
,,,,,I wished we got your Pastrami Sandwich with cheese... fail. It was delicious none the less! Not salty as most places. Really flavorful and huge portion!!! 
,,,,,"Note: If you lose the ticket they give you, they make you pay a fee at the door when you leave. Why? I don't know. Just don't lose the ticket."
,,,,,Recently came in from out of town and visited on the recommendation of every chef friend I've talked to.
,,,,,Came in on a Saturday around lunch time and was very pleased to have not had to wait in a line outside to get in. 
,,,,,At the front door they handed us each tickets
,,,,,"(DO NOT LOSE/THROW THESE AWAY, eeek had to go purse-fishing)"
,,,,,The separation between lines by-the-cutter and restaurant service was very clever. The decoration&design of the restaurant served up very hip-but-nostalgic Jewish Deli vibes with retro neon and kitchy posters.
,,,,,"We had a service dog with us so we decided to simplify the process by choosing a waiter-serviced table. The server was prompt, and brought us water, pickles, and a menu within minutes of sitting."
,,,,,"We went with a pastrami reuben and a turkey reuben, and split a side of steak fries."
,,,,,The pastrami reuben was absolutely ridiculous. Seriously stupid good. 
,,,,, I was surprised but not definitely mad about the sandwich not being on seeded rye.
,,,,,"The meat was absolutely delicious&tender, well seasoned but not overly salted, a testament to that there's no going back to other, less-loved pastrami cuts once you've had this."
,,,,,"The Turkey felt light, was very juicy and moist"
,,,,,"The Russian dressing was clearly made in-house, pickle-heavy, and fantastic."
,,,,,Bathe me in that and I'll be a happy lady.
,,,,,"Before visiting I thought it maaaay perhaps be over-rated, but I couldn't find a con here if i tried. Will absolutely make a point to return on every trip I make to Manhattan."
,,,,,I don't know why this place is so popular. It's good but not worth the $20 price tag. And that's $20 for a basic just meat. If you want any add-ons like coleslaw you have to pay $7 to have it on the side.
,,,,,We thought one sandwich would be enough for both of us because it was so expensive but we were wrong. Thank goodness we also decided to share a bowl of matzah ball soup for $10 (also pretty steep). We ordered the corned beef and it was very tasty (they let us sample the meat). We also ordered a side of coleslaw to enjoy with our sandwiches.
,,,,,Everything was good but the total came out to $47. A lot for a deli meal. And it wasn't any better than the meals I have had at other delis that were about half the cost.
,,,,,The line system was also super confusing if you are a first-timer. Basically there is not one line. There are multiple lines and you just have to get in one. Kind of like a checkout line at the grocery store. But be careful cause when I was in line there was only one person ahead of me but she was ordering for her entire family and had never been before so she was taking forever sampling all the different meats! My husband and I got in separate lines so thankfully his moved a lot faster.
,,,,,Probably won't come here again.
,,,,,Katz's delicatessen is a New York institution . The pastrami sandwich and the matzaball soup they make are to die for.
,,,,,"Let's throw another one into the mountain of reviews that Katz already has throughout the years.  Have been here (and other similar delis) numerous times, and I have to say that Katz is still my go-to.  Sure, prices have increased substantially over the years, but it's really hard to find another joint that can really do what they do.  "
,,,,,"When I first came here, the sandwich was around $14.  Now it's up to $22 each, and there are still boatloads of people lining up for it day after day.  There's a reason for that.  Granted, many may be tourists trying to figure out what it's all about.  However, there certainly is a good amount of repeat customers that know exactly why they are coming back for more.  "
,,,,,"Personally, it's a too much to come here on a routine basis for me, but I do get that craving once in awhile.  I will drive my ass all the way here and put up with the chaos and the crowd.  Also, I do notice a bit of difference on quality compared to years ago.  Meat tends to be more on the dry side now.  Still a cut above the rest though."
,,,,,"Came here last night and ordered a pastrami sandwich. It was a really good sandwich and they gave me samples of it to eat while I was waiting, but it was definitely not good enough to be $24. Customer service was great when ordering my sandwich and when checking out."
,,,,,"I have to admit, Katz's Delicatessen was certainly phenomenal. Atmosphere is very unique and fun. Every single item that we have ordered was very fresh and yummy. All of the staff are super polite - you really feel welcome and looked after. Sometimes things are just done right."
,,,,,We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your first visit - we love making new fans. Hope to see you back again soon!
,,,,,"No words for the pastrami sandwich, but delicious. I got the whole sandwich, but I could've just gotten a half and been good. It's big enough to share. The Matzo ball soup was also good. My husband got a half of pastrami with the chicken noodle soup. Also a chili dog. My husband said the chicken noodle soup was better than the pastrami. Well...okay. It was good soup, I will say that. The chili dog was decent and it was gone in matter of minutes. "
,,,,,"I was kinda looking forward to the whole Katz ordering experience with getting the number and going to the butcher ordering process. Since we had granny in a wheelchair in tow, we got table service. Still had to have the number. Don't ever lose your number!"
,,,,,"I'm a New Yorker and somehow I never had the opportunity to come to Katz Deli , even though a knew where it was and had seen it many times."
,,,,,I'm not impressed at all.
,,,,,I had a matzo ball soup  and a pastrami sandwich.
,,,,,And was surprised at how expensive it was . $22.45 for the Pastrami sandwich and $7.90 for the Matzo ball soup ???
,,,,,And the even hot? 
,,,,,Perhaps I had higher expectations.
,,,,,The workers here are nice and quick . 
,,,,,I can take it of my list now.
,,,,,"this place is hilariously overpriced.  $20+ for a sandwich?  yes, you get a lot of meat, but the sandwiches are otherwise bland with little taste."
,,,,,don't waste your money.

,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,"Almost didn't make it to this place but so happy to get here just in time to be the first in line OUTSIDE! Lol this place is crazy busy but they have a system locked down. As busy as it was, we didn't wait long. YOU HAVE TO GO HERE!! We ordered their famous pastrami and corned beef sandwiches. BOTH were amazing. Wish we ate it right there but we had to pack it up and eat it at the airport. Still amazing. The pickles are not that great BUT you have to get the pickled green tomatoes. It was heaven!  We saw the famous ""When Harry Met Sally"" table, too. It was pretty cool! Staff was working hard but always shared a smile.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! Must try!! PS: they let you sample the meats, too!!"
,,,,,"We're so glad that you enjoyed your first visit - there's nothing we love more than making new fans. Though we do often serve a packed house, if you want to try dodging the crowds next time drop by at an off-peak hour: breakfast, between lunch/dinner or late nights on weekends. Also, if you're ever craving a pastrami fix on the West Coast, we do offer free two-day shipping on orders over $100!"
,,,,,"Horrible awful service for horrible awful food that was completely over priced ($20 for a pastrami sandwich??). Staff is incredibly rude, slow, and inefficient; wait time (more than 1 hour) is ridiculous. "
,,,,,"No places to sit, entire place feels dirty and grungy and covered with grease. "
,,,,,"Don't understand why anyone would bother coming here when you can orde subpar, underwhelming between slices of white bread at any other deli in the city without being berated by restaurant staff. "
,,,,,0 stars if I could.
,,,,,"If I were rating Katz's based on the pastrami alone it would get 5 stars, however the overall experience was a bit chaotic. I am still unsure why they have the ticketing system. Basically all adults entering the establishment are handed a blue ticket regardless if they order anything or not. In order to leave the place you MUST hand back the ticket or else you face a $50 fee. "
,,,,,"I came with my family and soon after we entered, it was so crowded that they said they would wait outside. They were confronted by security to surrender their blue tickets, so they had to come back to me and get the tickets in order to leave this place..totally bazaar! There's really no line so you just line up and wait. The carvers trim the pastrami with precision and give you a few slices on a small plate to sample while you wait for your sandwich. Everything here is sliced by hand, so the cut is thicker than most other places. The sandwiches are filled with so much delicious meat. It's really not a sandwich...more like two slices of rye in between over a pound of pastrami. I estimate that each whole pastrami makes about 3.5 sandwiches after everything is trimmed and sliced. Credit card payments are accepted in the back, cash only up front at the door. $23+ for a delicious pastrami sandwich."
,,,,,"It insane that im saying this but, its not overrated. I dont even like red meat, but i could eat pastrami here every day. It is so worth the money, one sandwich feels like 2 meals."
,,,,,"Katz's is probably the most famous deli in New York, if not the world."
,,,,,I've lived five minutes from here for almost three years but my first visit was last weekend. Somehow my desire for meat and willigness to wait in line never quite dovetail. But around 11 am on a Sunday the lines were mild and my boyfriend and I decided it was the day.
,,,,,"Katz's is chaotic in a way it doesn't need to be. Confusingly, there's a small section for table service. There are at least three places to queue for food, though I believe only two of those serve sandwiches. The lines are self-forming and unpoliced, which leads to a lot of cutting."
,,,,,"It took us maybe 20 minutes to get our sandwich, and that was with a negligible line compared to the hordes coming in when we left. Service is rushed and indifferent. Tables aren't very clean and if you get soup there'll be about as much on the plate as in the bowl."
,,,,,"So, why go?"
,,,,,"The pastrami is truly all that. Thick cut, mildly smoky, moist, reminiscent of a pleasantly fatty brisket. Excellent. All it needs is that nice sharp mustard and a few bites of pickle. Absolutely worth the $22 split between two people."
,,,,,"We also had a chocolate egg cream (unknown, at least $5) and matzoh ball soup ($8). The former is a great example, a bit creamier than typical. The latter is mostly broth and ball, but both are solid. It's massive so split this as well."
,,,,,"After tax and tip, this somehow added up to $60. They're cash only and you pay with your ticket on the way out."
,,,,,"Overall, the experience is stressful but it's worth doing at least once. I may look into delivery to get that meat without the hassle, but I know I'll be going back for it."
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your meal, but sorry that you were frustrated by the crowds - though we do often serve a packed house, during off-peak hours we tend to be less busy (breakfast, between lunch/dinner and late nights on weekends). We hope you'll give us another chance to serve you up the perfect sandwich in a slower setting!"
,,,,,"I don't recommend their online ordering. The meat we ordered arrived frozen which is fine because it needed to be kept cold during transport. Upon thawing/preparing the vacuum sealed pack, the brisket was slimy with grease and absolutely flavorless. We picked out the best slices, made two sandwiches and threw the rest away. There was no amount of doctoring of this meat that was going to make it taste better. Also, we ordered a plain cheesecake and received a chocolate cheesecake which actually was very tasty, but at $40, they should ship the right dessert. We'll stick with local delis going forward."
,,,,,"I am giving Katz's Deli a 5 star not only because of the tasty food but because of the great customer serivce that Theresa gave me.  I ordered my ""birthday package"" and it shipped on time, however UPS failed to deliver it Next day, sadly it turned into 5 days.  But anyway, I kept in touch with Katz (probably overkill, but I wanted it so badly) and Theresa responded and shipped out a new package for me and also credited back my shipping cost.  "
,,,,,"Needless to say when the new box arrived I was ready to go.. had my water boiling and dropped a package of pastrami and corned beef into the water to reheat and made my sandwhiches for my husband and I and it took us right back to New York and we happily relived our visit there...the sandwhich was probably not as big (saving some meat for another sandwhich) but with the mustard, bread and pickles it was tasty as ever!  Thank you again and I will reorder.  Stay safe and sane!!"
,,,,,"If you don't like pastrami, don't go here. The sandwich, if you can call it that, is essentially just meat with bread on the ends. I understand that that is appealing to some, just wasn't for me."
,,,,,This one star is (NOT) based on the food! It's based on the experience of this craphole! You've been warned! 
,,,,,"I'm a New Yorker not a tourist, I walked in here to get my husband a pastrami sandwich and the moment I stepped foot into the door I'm given a ticket and there's a ghetto female shouting at everyone saying that there's ""5 separate lines"" she wasn't just shouting it because the place was extremely crowded and loud, she was shouting it with such nastiness and rudeness as if she hated her damn job. She should definitely look into applying somewhere else because that's obviously not the job for her with her poor customer service. "
,,,,,"Moving along, the line to order a sandwich was ridiculous. I had people pretty much dry humping me from behind just to get past me. I found it extremely uncomfortable because these people literally rub up against you to get through to the exit or to the tight small seating area. Someone even spilled a hot soup on another guy's arm. Thank Goodness it's Fall and we have on coats, that would've been a lawsuit waiting to happen. This place is seriously a fire hazard!!! With all the money they're making off 1 sandwich alone and the amount of people who come here, they should have a much more spacious ordering and eating area. "
,,,,,"Another thing they don't tell you is that the ticket they give you when you're entering the store is also the ticket you'll need to get out of the store. If you lose that ticket all hell breaks loose and you WILL have to pay. What type of greedy environment is this? You're basically saying that if I drop my ticket in this crowded store and decided to leave because of the crowds, I have to pay you just for my presence? That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen in NYC my entire 31 years of life and I've seen a lot of ridiculous things. I understand that they're doing this for theft reasons but they seem to have the worse system I've ever seen in any eatery here in NYC. They need new management ASAP!! Will I come here again? Hell No! I'm more than sure there's other great sandwich stores who sells banging Pastrami out there. It's not worth it! "
,,,,,"The chefs you order from are very sweet and nice, they offer you a sample to taste the meat first and they hook you up as quick as possible. The Pastrami was definitely on point but if you're claustrophobic, have anxiety, don't like being touched, cant deal with stupidity, then this is not the place for you. Obviously it's not the place for me and lot of my friends who called me out on fb for even coming here, lol. That is all."
,,,,,"We went really early, so there were no line.  When you walk through the door, you are given a ticket for each person.  Make sure you don't lose your ticket, you will be charged if so!  "
,,,,,"We decided that we were going to split a pastrami sandwich, so that we do not over eat, since we plan on eating another place after this.  We walked up to a craver and was very excited, he cut us a piece of pastrami, and boy, was it delicious!"
,,,,,"We ate our huge delicious pastrami sandwich, and was contemplating on ordering another, since we shared one.. but we had to resist!  We was going to make a trip back to Katz while we were in NYC, but failed to do so... so I shall visit the establishment again!"
,,,,,We're so glad that you enjoyed your experience - there's nothing we love more than making new fans! Stop by again soon and give our Reuben a try!

,,,,,The BEST sandwiches!  Worth the wait to experience their dream-worthy food.  Huge sandwiches so prepare to be full.
,,,,,I love this place fantastic sandwiches the beat Pickles handsdown the kosher salami is out of this world this place just needs to renovate a lottle too too old inside but foodwise its greattt
,,,,,The best deli around from the corned beef to matzoh ball soup and the crunchy delicious pickles at the beginning of every meal and can't forget about the chocolate egg cream. Yum
,,,,,"I love everything about Katz's Deli. Food is great, even though it's pricy, but for the best deli food, there is no substitute. Wish they'd come to Vegas...we need a good deli here."
,,,,,"So disappointed.  Being from New York and having been to Katz's Deli several times, we thought that ordering home delivery (as opposed to driving over 300 miles) would work well.  However, the pastrami was dry, the kinsches were not tasty at all and the kiska did not have the flavor it should have."
,,,,,"We are so sorry to hear that you had such a negative experience - we never want any customer to be less than thrilled with any aspect of their meal. We thank you for your honest feedback - if you'd like to speak further with someone, please feel free to call or reach out through our website anytime."

,,,,,I finally made a trip to the famous Katz's Deli and I'm so happy I did. It is truly an experience.
,,,,,"As soon as you walk in, you're handed a ticket that you need to keep with you throughout the duration of your meal because that's how they mark the items you order for your checkout later. "
,,,,,"There are multiple stations where you can order. I always heard the pastrami sandwich is the thing to order, so I did. My deli server even let me sample a few pieces of the pastrami. It was melt in your mouth delicious. The sandwich is filled, and I mean FILLED with pastrami. My gf and I shared one sandwich and we were stuffed with just one half each! "
,,,,,"I washed my sandwich down with some Katz's lemonade. It's one of the best lemonades I've ever had. We also ordered a side of fries. They come in big, steak slices. They were hot, crisp, and freshly made. "
,,,,,The staff was so kind and friendly! The restaurant was filled with photos and old memorabilia. I couldn't help but look at all the famous faces on the wall and google more about Katz's history. 
,,,,,The only semi-negative thing I can say about this place is that the prices are expensive. But you definitely get what you pay for!
,,,,,"Notes: 1) To pay cash, pay in the front. To pay credit, go to the back. 2) They sell baked goods here too!"
,,,,,#Classic place. First time back in over 10 years.
,,,,,"I met my #friend there who was just leaving as I came in. He was like ""Oh, you want the rest of my food?"" I was like, ""okay."" Then we sat at a table and I thought he was #punking me or #Jamie Kennedy X'ing me, because I thought we were just sitting at some random people's leftovers. I'm still not positive if they were his leftovers or not, but it was good."
,,,,,"The beers were way #more expensive than I was expecting. They should have a sign that says, ""This is where Harry Met Sally and paid $17.90 plus tax and tip for two beers."""
,,,,,"Here's the thing, this place is delicious and it's a total NY Deli experience but I personally prefer Sarge's. I feel like Katz's charges about the same amount but you don't get that giant sandwich that you used to at the Carnegie or currently at Sarge's. Make it bigger or charge less. Other than that, I have no complaints but I probably won't eat here unless someone I'm eating with insists because I think that Sarge's is great and a better value."
,,,,,PROS:
,,,,,"- I mean, this place is famous for a reason. You get to experience what Harry felt like when he met Sally ;) "
,,,,,CONS:
,,,,,"- So so so crowded. Honestly, this place is so hectic. It's expected from some place as famous as this but it still takes you out of an enjoyable experience when you feel like you're being rushed and everything is crazy."
,,,,,"- I just simply do not understand the ticket system but regardless, don't lose the ticket since they charge a $50 fee if you don't hand them a ticket upon leaving the place"
,,,,,SPECIFICS:
,,,,,"- Katz's Pastrami = Lots and lots of meat, which is good. But the proportion to bread and everything else is just off. Don't get me wrong, the pastrami is the best that I've ever had and to be honest, I'm not a big pastrami person and even I think it's good. But it is a little underwhelming after you've had the first couple of bites."
,,,,,"- Fries = So good. There's a good balance of soft and fat fries to the thin and crispy fries so whichever kind you prefer, you're golden. "
,,,,,"- Pickles = Random thing to put on there, I know. But my god their pickles are so. good. I love pickles in general so that could just be me but I love how they had 2 types of pickles. The one that's not as pickled was delicious. It has a cleaner taste than the darker pickle since it didn't have as strong of a vinigar taste so the spices they used to soak it in was more evident"
,,,,,OVERVIEW:
,,,,,"- If you come to NY and you're into the touristy stuff, then this is a must-stop. Despite any complaints that I've had, I'm glad I came here just for the experience and to see what all the hype is about. It's something that you should definitely give a try. But would I ever go through all this again for what I got? Probably not."

,,,,,"We're so glad that you enjoyed your meal but sorry that you were frustrated by the crowds - during peak hours the store can get pretty packed! If you're craving a half-sour pickle without the crowds, try stopping by at an off peak hour - breakfast, between lunch and dinner or late nights on weekends (we're open 24/7). Hope you'll give us another shot!"
,,,,,I would love this place better if I didn't have gout unfortunately pastrami and cornedbeef and beef hotdogs all messed with my gout symptoms. Gout as you know is a calcium pyrophosphate disease when Uric acid crystals build up in the tissues. years ago I felt the repercussions of many years of tailgating at Jets games eating London broil and bratwurst with my fellow middle-aged folks.

,,,,,"The most delicious, super meat loaded sandwich I've ever had! I love everything about this place, it's big, old school and open almost every time we go there! The meat is tender and bit juicy, all that sandwich combination I had was amazing! We went there after midnight on Friday, and still have seen a huge amount of people(which was a surprise for me). But since it's a huge place, everyone was seated and set. "
,,,,,Absolutely love their sandwiches!
,,,,,They don't sell lasagna !! :( and they get mad if you lose your ticket :( don't go there drunk
,,,,,Be ready to wait in line to place your order but while you wait look over the menu (or even go in knowing what you'd to order) because when it's your time to place your order you better be ready because the VERY busy staff has no time to waste. 
,,,,,The amount of food you get is crazy huge and delicious!! I had a pastrami and corned beef sandwich on rye- amazing! The matzo-ball soup is a must have. When I went I took a taxi so not sure about the parking situation but I'm sure it has to be tough finding a spot with the amount of people that are packed inside. 
,,,,,A must-go-to place if your in NYC!
,,,,,"What can I say about Katz's that hasn't already been said? This really is the best pastrami on rye you will ever have. Soft bread surrounding indescribably amazing slices of meat so damn tender that no matter how high they stack it, you can eat it in manageable bites, bread and all. The corned beef is no slouch either. "
,,,,,"Do yourself a favor and go to the far right, the grill counter, and order a hot dog with mustard and sauerkraut, then eat it while you stand on one of the sandwich lines. When you finally get to the front of the line, drop a nice tip in the jar and ask for a pastrami, juicy, mustard only. Trust me, this is the right way. I can't guarantee you will get samples out of doing it this way, but we did. I'm sure it helped that I was waiting with two much older ladies (my mom and her long lost high school friend), but even so, do it right, say it right, and you may get lucky. I think you can order sides at this counter and then drinks at the left end counter, but since we ordered neither, I can't tell you for sure."
,,,,,"Still, don't be thrown or overwhelmed by the process or the crowd. Get your ticket, get it marked at every counter where you place an order - DON'T LOSE THE TICKET - then give it to the cashier when you're done. Boom, all good. Also: cash only unless you pay with Amex, I believe. I tried to pay with Visa and she said cash only, but I've heard that's not always the case? Not sure, but I was lucky I had $60 cash on me. No biggie."
,,,,,"Amazing food, amazing experience, definitely going back when I visit NYC, crowded insanity notwithstanding."
,,,,,"Hands down, best sandwich spot on the planet. A NYC sandwich aficionado. My kids and I LOVE IT!!"
,,,,,LOVE IT that is all I really want to say is that I truly love the food here.  The portions are absolutely ridiculous.  I love the pastrami and the extra relaxed deli vibe.  
,,,,,I am a fan and will return!
,,,,,"Pastrami sandwich was really good, great with mustard on top. A bit pricy, 25 for the sandwich itself, I split a sandwich and got 2 water bottles with my girlfriend and it was 50 dollars.... besides that, I would come again."
,,,,,Highly recommend this place!
,,,,,Visiting from out of town!
,,,,,Came & ate pastrami on rye with Swiss cheese & there yummy mustard on the side (Normally I don't like mustard but it was really good)
,,,,,The pickles were fresh. 
,,,,,There was a wait but after having there food I know why
,,,,,"I don't think my review will affect the sales or opinion of Katz's but having had a fantastic New Years Day meal here, I had to add my praise. The old Automat slogan, ""you can't eat atmosphere"" applies here since, ahem, the decor is at best, historic. Right out of a movie set (literally, as it turns out), you should spend time soaking up the century of cooking and eating that's plastered on the walls. Old photos chronicle The Who's who of past clients.  "
,,,,,"The program: Walk in, get a ""ticket"" that you hand to your server or carver and the adventure begins. Corned beef or very lean pastrami are the only things to order. You can get hot dogs, etc., elsewhere but this place is a pastrami palace and it's what I enjoyed. "
,,,,,I had fries and a cream soda with my pastrami on rye. Good mustard on the side and I was in heaven. Noisy? A little. Fun? A lot! An adventure? Of course. 
,,,,,Prices are NYC acceptable and downright cheap when you consider the quality. The now take credit cards too...
,,,,,"Put this on your bucket list. Then after eating, cross the street and have gelato for dessert and get ready to send me a thank you card... ;-)."
,,,,,We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your meal! It's our long-time fans that make our jobs truly fun and rewarding. Hope to see you back again soon in the new year!
,,,,,"With so many reviews, mine won't affect things but to be fair, I always wanted to try their hot pastrami on rye with fries and a cream soda and I scratched that itch just before Christmas. The food did not disappoint - nope, not one little bit. So good, so rich and juicy - truly an experience. "
,,,,,"No, not health food and definitely not a low cost fast sandwich. But the value is there and the well-worn ambiance makes it food theatre."
,,,,,"I probably won't come here a lot because of distance and cost (and cholesterol concerns) but if you eat meat, this is a place you need to visit at least once. A food bucket list kind of thing for anyone who thinks herself or himself a foodie. "
,,,,,Go - you'll thank me later.
,,,,,HOLY COW. THIS WAS TOO GOOD. So I'm writing this review a month after I tried Katz and I'm still craving it!!!
,,,,,I originally wanted to come here because I've seen this place in so many movies and shows. The place was huge (very surprising for nyc). You enter the place and you are given a ticket. KEEP THIS TICKET AT ALL COSTS. it's $50 for a lost ticket. Keep your ticket even if you're not ordering anything. Afterwards you get a menu from the counter and once you're ready you line up in front of one of the deli chefs and you order there.
,,,,,You can sample different meats as well. You pay at the counter after you receive your meal. Tip well if you want a big cut! Ask for pickles/cucumbers if you want them. 
,,,,,"This is open seating and this place was packed when I came, so send someone in your crew to grab a spot first. Water is self served as well."
,,,,,We got the pastrami sandwich. I originally thought it was pricey. $28 for a sandwich!!! But you get almost a pound of meat in your sandwich. I definitely could not finish the whole thing. One sandwich is good for 2 people. 
,,,,,The pastrami was so thick and fat and juicy and tender. Their mustard was extremely good as well and went well with the pastrami. 
,,,,,This place does nationwide delivery as well! You can order by the pound and have it shipped to you.
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your first visit - there's nothing we love more than making new fans! And yes, we do offer nationwide shipping - and free two-day on orders over $100. Hope to see you back again soon!"

,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,"This place is such a letdown. We looked at reviews online and was told this was a place we needed to go to while visiting NYC. When we arrived at the restaurant the line outside the door. Once we got in our temperatures we're checked and we sat ourselves. My husband went to order a corn beef sandwich which had no cheese! The pickle taste off. The meat on the corn beef sandwich was very very salty. The price of the sandwich was $21 for 1 sandwich. This place is over hype, overpriced and we will not be returning."
,,,,,We're so sorry to hear that you've had such negative experiences. We will take the matter to heart and look into the issue - we never want any customer to be anything less than thrilled with the quality of their meal. Thank you for bringing this to our attention - please feel free to call and speak to a manager anytime.
,,,,,"I don't know what got over me, but I came here once again. I find myself here anytime I am becoming the self-proclaimed tour guide. It feels like the natural thing to do: when in the city, you get a Katz's pastrami sandwich. "
,,,,,"This place doesn't come without its flaws though. It is ALWAYS crowded and with the crowd it attracts, it still hasn't figured out a faster and better system to take your order. It is minor chaos as you wait in your line to order your sandwich, knowing you will have to wait through another line to get your side order, annnd another one to get your soup. By the time you are ready to eat, at least one of your three items will be cold. So, a word of advice: divide and conquer. Oh, and don't forget to have someone in your party get the seats, as they will fill up quickly. "
,,,,,"Best sandwich to order, by consensus, is the pastrami sandwich on rye. They will ask you if you want mustard on your sandwich, say yes; they will ask if you want pickles, another yes for that one. If I'm paying 23 large bucks for a sandwich, I better be getting everything that goes with it. All joking aside, the pickles are large and juicy and the mustard is a no-brainer for that juicy sandwich with the most tender meat you will have this year. "
,,,,,"This time, I decided to branch out and try their matzo ball soup. With $8 for a meatless soup, you're certainly paying a hefty price. Yet, being the meat shop this place truly is, the meat broth tastes like you are eating beef with every slurp. The matzo ball is soft and tasty, easy to cut with your spoon and easy to mix with the soup. It heated me up while I was getting over my cold."
,,,,,"I tried the NY chocolate egg cream just to educate myself. It is literally chocolate syrup, milk, and spritz seltzer water mixed together for $5. I couldn't believe it would taste good and after having drunk it, I still wouldn't prefer it over the good old milkshake, but am glad I tasted it. The fact that someone thought of inventing such a concoction alone makes it worth the try."
,,,,,"Before we came to NYC, everyone said to come to Katz's Delicatessen and get the pastrami sandwich. They also advised to not lose our ticket that we get upon entering. If everyone says to come here, we had to come here. Make sure to bring cash because they are cash only. We got to the restaurant around lunch time. They advised us at the entrance, where you get your ticket, that we could wait for a table which will have a server to serve us or we could get our own food from the cutter then find an open table to dine on. There was a wait for a table and the place wasn't too busy so we took our chances to go cafeteria style. "
,,,,,"While I was standing in line at the cutter section, someone dining behind us left so Mink quickly took the table. Score! There are two sections in the restaurant. First section is the meats and sandwiches (left and middle of wall). Second section is the grilled items and soup (far right of wall). I first stood in line for the meats and sandwiches because the line was shorter. You'll get a sample slice to munch on while waiting for the cutter to prepare your order. I ordered 1/2 pastrami sandwich and 1/2 brisket sandwich, both with no mustard. It came with two types of pickles. The pastrami sandwich is probably one of the best, if not the best, pastrami sandwiches I've had in my life. Brisket was very good too but you have to get the pastrami sandwich. The pickles were legit! As full as I was at the end of the meal, I ate them all. "
,,,,,"After ordering in the meat and sandwich section, I stood in line in the grilled items and soup section. Mink wanted a grilled cheese sandwich and I wanted a bowl of their Matzo ball soup. The soup broth was very good and the dish complimented the meal perfectly. Mink really enjoyed her grilled cheese sandwich. Service is very friendly in the entire establishment. There is also free water in the back that is self serve. The restaurant is constantly busy so keep that in mind. You'll pay as you leave. If you have never been here before, you have to come here. Until next time that I'll be in NYC, I'm gonna dream about coming back here..."
,,,,,"We're so glad that you enjoyed your experience here - we love making new fans! If you want to try dodging the crowds, come by at an off peak hour (breakfast, between lunch/dinner, and late night on the weekends). Drop by again next time you're in town and give our Reuben a whirl!"
,,,,,What can you say the best pastrami anywhere. The atmosphere is out of sight. The staff is exactly what you would expect very helpful and when you as great as they are they have systems of getting things done. Different stations for different items. I grew up in New York and have been eating here since then and every time I visit. It's a real treat to have and a great throwback to see how good things are when things don't change. Much respect to you all and can't wait to return to the tradition that is Katz delicatessen
,,,,,"I was physically assaulted by the staff, I gave them my ticket and left in a hurry so they decide to put me in a chokehold from behind in front of my mother and sister after I just spent over a hundred dollars."
,,,,,Good meat but very overpriced. Large sandwiches can be shared. Old style deli atmosphere. Dr. Brown sodas are a big plus.
,,,,,"I now understand why Katz's is so famous, this place really is special. Definitely recommend coming here at an off time to avoid long lines since it is so popular. I came here around 10:45am on a Monday and there was just a short line. If you're visiting NYC, this absolutely is a must stop for food."
,,,,,"We're so glad that you enjoyed your first visit here - there's nothing we love more than making new fans. And you're right - if you want to dodge the crowd, it's best to stop by at an off-peak hour: breakfast, between lunch/dinner or late nights on weekends. Hope to see you back again soon!"
,,,,,The locals all said today was a bad day.
,,,,,"We had a cutter who cut with the grain, not against, and the pastrami was not particularly tasty or flavorful."
,,,,,"Saving the visit was the fact that it was an early hour and mostly empty (although it had begun to fill quickly by the time we left), the liver salami was delicious, and we met some great locals who were excellent company and similarly enthused about the wonders of pastrami and other New York cuisines."
,,,,,"I just wish the pastrami had lived to its name, but today was a sufficiently bad that had I not known better, I would never come back."
,,,,,After coming here for 4 straight years. The quality hasn't changed. Make sure you tip well and chose a deli guy with a heavy hand :)
,,,,,I've only gotten the pastrami but why waste your time on anything else? Always a long line but always worth the wait! Love you Katz Deli!!!
,,,,,The food here is undoubtedly amazing here. It's the best I've ever had in my life. But the biggest appeal Katz's has is the nostalgia and the history of the institution. 
,,,,,How it works:
,,,,,1.walk through the door and get a ticket. The ticket will be used to pay when you leave. 
,,,,,2. Get in line for a cutter. This is where you will order and get your food.
,,,,,3. Enjoy the delicious food.
,,,,,4. Give the ticket to the cashier to pay. CASH ONLY
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,"Went to Katz as I usually do after a night out. The guy at the counter charged me over $30 for my pastrami sandwich. I know with tax included that the sandwich is not over $30. The cashier tipped himself without my permission. I usually tip these guys anyway but it's usually my choice. Then he ""accidentally"" rips my receipt so I could not see what I had paid for. With $20 sandwiches you would think Katz paid their employees somewhat decently So  that they dont have to steal from customers. I won't be back here for a while.. I'd rather go somewhere that the people are at least honest and don't steal from customers. Such a disappointment. Do better Katz."
,,,,,And to top it off the $30 sandwich was terrible that day!! So disappointed with Katz.
,,,,,"Doesn't get better than Katz's. One of the good things that came out of Corona for me, was finding that Katz's delivers nationwide. I am so impressed with their shipping service. Must say, it is A1 top level. They spare no expense in packaging, to keep food cold and the  package insulated. Of course, it's not surprising, because their food is A1 as well. You can tell, they are a company that is particular to providing excellent quality.  I consider myself a pastrami snob, and I highly recommend the pastrami, even though its not freshly served in their store. Coming by UPS and having to heat it up myself, it is still unbelievably delicious - mouth watering - to be honest. Their Nova Lox is the best i have ever had. Best place for delicious old fashioned deli food."
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your delivery, as well as your visits here - our long-time fans are truly the backbone of our restaurant. Hope to see you back for an in-person pastrami fix next time you're in town!"
,,,,,"No one is more patient than Katz employees late at night. A sea of drunk zombies and tourists being herded through sandwich heaven only to fully fist pickles into their mouths with zero regard for public decency. Thank you for not judging us, you golden unicorns."
,,,,,"Katz's Deli is a New York City staple. It doesn't matter the audience, both locals and tourists come here to get their famous pastrami sandwich."
,,,,,Need to know:
,,,,,"1)When you arrive, you will be handed a ticket. This ticket allows you to order, do not lose this ticket or you will have to pay extra."
,,,,,2)Know what you want before you get to the front. You will get kicked to the back of the line if you reach the front... and locals will laugh.
,,,,,"The hot pastrami sandwich is the go to sandwich. Smoked and juicy pastrami between two slices of bread. It is a delight! Along with the pickles and cucumbers, it makes for the perfect lunch."
,,,,,"My pirate friend suggested we go here; despite being born in NY it was my first time. I honestly had begun to think of it as a likely over-rated tourist destination, the lines were off-putting, I didn't care about sitting in the When Harry Met Sally booth, etc. "
,,,,,"But they serve a quality product! Me and the friend split a pastrami sandwich and it was delicious. Splitting is the way to go, as the portions are massive. The bread to meat ratio is off, the bread could really be sliced thicker. The meat is fatty, you will feel your arteries clogging as juice drips off the sandwich and down your fingers. There's a reason the drunk masses pile in from the bars. But it's still delicious. I still think Harry & Ida's is better, but their sandwich is even pricier and comes with a smaller portion. Besides, this place is old NY charming. "
,,,,,"Steak fries can be skipped. Instead, get their coleslaw. This might just be the best coleslaw I've ever had. They put freakin horseradish in there- YES! And it's buttermilk based. I wanted a second portion it was so good, I'd come back just for this. "
,,,,,"The dining area is large, brightly lit, cafeteria like. You're given a ticket (in our case by someone who was a dead ringer for Prince Akeem from Coming to America, outfit and all) which you must not lose. The ticket is how you pay, if you lose it they just charge you $50. Which is close to what you're going to pay if you get two sandwiches, sides, and drinks anyway. It keeps the ordering line moving. "
,,,,,"You order your sandwich first, they give you a little sample of the meat to try while they prepare it. Then as you move down the line you can order sides, drinks, get silverware, and beer. You pay on the way out by showing your ticket."
,,,,,Cats never failed me I've been going here for 20 years to pastrami sandwich is out of this world the best pickles in the world the coleslaw everything is just great and even during Covid they've been on point I highly recommend whoever never been to cats to try this place
,,,,,"A staple to any New York visit. After shopping around in SoHo, we decided to stop by for lunch around 1PM. We waited about 20 minutes outside and 15 mins inside. "
,,,,,"We had some foreigners in front of us that somehow pissed our guy off and then he was rude to us. I ordered the matzo ball soup first and then asked to try the corn beef and pastrami. I barely got to taste the corn beef about to try the pastrami and then he was rushing us to choose which one. Under pressure I ordered the pastrami and I was not disappointed. Also some local lady was annoyed behind us saying ""oh my god"" when we were still trying the pieces he sliced for us. Sorry lady a few seconds of us tasting the meat isn't going to make things go faster, our guy serving us was taking his time by complaining and being upset already. "
,,,,,Back to the sandwich...The pastrami was so tender and juicy and went well with the rye and mustard. The half sours were okay and the pickle were standard. I never got my matzo ball soup and didn't want to deal with this guy and his attitude anymore. 
,,,,,4 for food but I would have gave the service a 3 (the guys bussing tables were nice and quick). Average rating 3.5 then round up to 4 stars.
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your meal but sorry that you were frustrated by our service. Though part of our charm for many of our customers is our ""old-school New York"" attitude, we understand that the atmosphere is not for everybody. It wasn't meant to be rude, just schtick - we never want any customer to feel neglected or dismissed. We hope you'll give us another chance to serve you up the food without the attitude!"
,,,,,"Katz's Delicatessen is a 24 hour deli and a New York institution, where many well-known people have dined. It is also featured in the film When Harry Met Sally, and you can sit at the very table where the scene was filmed. Most people go to Katz's Deli to try their Hot Pastrami or Corned Beef Sandwich. With almost 10,000 reviews on Yelp, I knew I had to check this place out. Luckily, my apartment was only a 20 minute walk away!"
,,,,,"Walking in, you simply take a ticket from the reception desk, line up at the counter, order and receive your food (you can also request to try a slice of pastrami while you wait) and pay at the end. Just make sure not to lose your ticket - there is a fine for US$50 if you do!"
,,,,,"Their Hot Pastrami Sandwich was definitely on the cards, but the portion size is massive - it would best be shared among two or three. Luckily, they do a half size, and this was perfect. So, I ordered the Half Pastrami Sandwich and Matzo Ball Soup, a side of pickles and an iced cold beer. The Pastrami was melt in your mouth delicious and writing this now, my mouth is drooling. It was honestly my favourite meal of my trip in New York - nothing compares to it!"
,,,,,"Very good pastrami and other meats. Wife had the briskets by themself and said that they were very good. I'll gladly pay $25 for their sandwich. The lines can get long but moves along fairly quickly. I took off 2 stars off because they gave me grief for losing a couple of tickets. You see, if you don't show them your ticket as you leave, they will hold you hostage. I spent $130 for lunch but because my wife and kids misplaced their tickets, we were interrogated before they let us go. For a moment, I thought we were dealing with airport TSA. I understand the intent but I don't appreciate the way we were treated."
,,,,,"Very good pastrami  but a bit too salty. Wife had the briskets by themself and said that they were very good. The lines can get long but moves along fairly quickly. I took off 2 stars because they gave me grief for losing a couple of tickets. You see, if you don't show them your ticket as you leave, they will hold you hostage. I spent $130 with a huge tip for lunch but because my wife and kids misplaced their tickets, we were interrogated before they let us go. For a moment, I thought we were dealing with airport TSA. I understand the intent but I don't appreciate the way we were treated. A word of advice: You should not use the ""one size fits all"" approach with everyone. I'm not some scmuck who stumbled into your joint. There's no need to threaten to charge another $50 for lost tickets! Not cool. Though their pastrami was good, I've had better and would not come back with the family. This place is a ""been there done that landmark"" in NYC. Buh bye."
,,,,,I am not a fan of pastrami. It is not something i would typically order. But the pastrami here really and truly is THAT good! It is also like 10 pounds so I could only eat half :( 
,,,,,"It was completely worth the money (it was a bit pricey) and the wait. Despite being crowded, it was also pretty clean as were the bathrooms. Bottom line: it lived up to the hype."

,,,,,I love this place. It lives up to its reputation and then some. The food is delicious and the portions are huge.. 2 things that I wished I would've known before I went were 1. If you go in you have to make sure you don't lose that stupid little ticket that they give you when you go in or they won't let you out until you pay for the lost ticket or you find the one they gave you. I had to empty my purse on the floor so I could leave the place. And 2. The portions are huge so if you don't eat a lot make sure you share it with someone. I could only eat half but the sandwich was $22 so I ended up having to give it to a family member so they could finish it.
,,,,,"Went in, didn't like what I saw- big old deli that was really busy. Tried to leave and got hassled by a-hole security guy for not having some kind of ticket. He wouldn't let me leave. I found a ticket on a table and bounced"
,,,,, Out if there. I'll never ever be back. What a crap experience.
,,,,,"What more can I say that hasn't already been said.  Every time I visit NYC this is a must.  Somehow, some way, I make it happen."
,,,,,"Yes, it's pretty much always busy.  Pastrami, Corned Beef are amazing.  Tip the guys behind the counter well and they will take care of you."
,,,,,"I saw the Knoblewurst Garlic Sausage on ""The Best Thing I ever ate"" so looking forward to trying that out next visit."
,,,,,Touristy & a bit pricey?-yes but no matter-worth it!
,,,,,"I love this place and the wonderful family who runs it but back in the day I could come here for a kosher hot dog...THE BEST! The hot dogs are no longer kosher which means total sadness for me. I cannot understand why this change was made...after all, since its on its own grill, it's the perfect set-up for Katz's to offer at least ONE strictly kosher item. C'mon guys, please reconsider on this one. Non-kosher dogs can contain anything, even the snouts of pigs...not even those customers who eat non-kosher would willingly want to eat that. Please during this pandemic time, bring back the one thing in my childhood that made me smile from ear to ear...your awesome grilled kosher hot dogs with the impossibly tight casing!!! It would be the best news as we ring in the Hebrew New Year - please consider this nod to your roots! Represent"
,,,,,"I just got a shipment of pastrami, tongue, derma and latkes.  We now live in Las Vegas and have missed all this stuff.  Took advantage of free shipping."
,,,,,"The pastrami and derma were beyond delicious.  I felt like I was eating it straight from your kitchen.  Sometimes food can lose something when you do it as take out, let alone having it shipped.  We were so happy that wasn't the case.  Easy cooking directions and just mouth watering food.  Looking forward to the tongue and latkes as well.  Will definitely do more shipments, next time will order the rye bread, that was a mistake on my part not to have."
,,,,,We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your meal - our long time fans are the backbone of our restaurant. Hope to see you back again soon for another pastrami fix!
,,,,,I don't get the hype. 
,,,,,"This is hands down the driest sandwich I've ever had. The meat was dry and the bread was dry and everything was just sad. :( The ticketing system was also confusing. I was lost and didn't even know who to turn to. As a short person, I had to make sure I got noticed. I spent almost $50 on two sandwiches and it was the worst decision I've made for a while. For the price, I don't even want to give it a second chance. I work near the Dekalb Market and turtled when I saw that they have a booth there."
,,,,,Katz won our informal pastrami competition with Sarge's hands down!  The meat was tastier and the rye bread was loaded to the edges. 
,,,,,"I took off a star because the system of ordering your food is chaotic. Each person entering is given a ticket and must hang onto it,  because you must hand it to the cashier to exit. You order your soup and sides at one end of the counter, sandwiches further down, and drinks and desserts at the end. You can use a credit card in the back. Cash only in the front."
,,,,,Not sure what the hype was all about. It is was a good pastrami place. The wait staff could have been a bit more responsive but truly... you go for the food. The food was good but one trip was enough for me.
,,,,,"I ordered food delivered to me in Western NY. I really loved the new dills, rye bread, tongue and split pea soup. But the matzo ball soup was way too salty."
,,,,,"It's ok...really it is just ok. €31 for a pastrami sandwich and fries, no drink."
,,,,,"Although pastrami is good, just too much meat. The bread could have been toasted. Fries could be better."
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,Had the pastrami Rueben.  It was delicious.  The pastrami was so good.  Very tender.  The bread was really fresh too
,,,,,"This was my first time trying Katz's sandwich and it was amazing. We followed the fame to this place and the wait was actually shorter than expected. I had a hard time deciding which sandwich to get because they all looked so delicious, but the security guy was nice to share his favorite is pastrami sandwich so we decided to go with that. They provided some sample for meat at the cutter when you, and the pastrami was so soft, juicy and flavorful. It was the best pastrami I have tried so far. We got our pastrami on rye sandwich with mustard. It was very satisfying to have so much pastrami and the pastrami was so soft and flavorful. "
,,,,,It was very crowded and hard to find a spot to seat. It was like fighting a war to get food here for me but it was very much worthwhile.
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your first visit - there's nothing we love more than making new fans. Though we do often serve a packed house, if you want to try dodging the crowds next time, drop by at an off-peak hour: breakfast, between lunch/dinner and late nights on weekends. Hope to see you back again soon for another pastrami fix!"
,,,,,"Katz's is  the last of a breed. There was a time when there were a lot more deli's down there. My favorite is the corned beef on rye with mustard. The corned beef is cooked perfectly and the Rye is always fresh. Their pastrami is excellent too. And these are real deli sandwiches where the meat is piled on, not just a few layers so have an appetite. Their matzo ball soup is good but since my wife makes the best matzo ball soup I've ever had I'll say that Katz's is very good for commercial soup. Sometimes the staff is rude but there's a few things to know, first, they're busy and second, you wouldn't know about the milk bars that used to be in that part of town where rudeness was an art form so consider any rudeness you get at Katz's a historical artifact and toughen up. And after you leave Katz's walk West on Houston. At the end of the block you'll come to Russ & Daughters. Check them out for your next gastronomic good time."
,,,,,The pastrami is always succulent and the cutters are always generous with a sample. It's worth it to tip them and important not to lose your ticket. Bringing cash isn't a bad idea since it'll help you check out faster. The Kugel is sweet and latkes are heavenly. Best deli in the world! Just go.
,,,,,The BEST pastrami hands down! I travelled from da Diego california and came here to get a sandwich. I ended up getting 2 and a matzo ball soup. 
,,,,,The pastrami is the best in the country!!!!! 
,,,,,Worth every penny. Love everything about this place.
,,,,,They've earned their stripes and they're famous for a reason--their sandwiches are legit and worth the slightly stressful trip of actually going to Katz's.
,,,,,"To be upfront, the sandwiches aren't cheap.  They give you a ton of meat (so much so that one sandwich is almost enough for two full meals), so it's pretty worth it for the value and quality, but $20 for a single sandwich is definitely pricey.  I wouldn't come here regularly for lunch, but whenever I visit NYC, it's a good spot to visit.  Their pastrami is so juicy, fatty, and tender, and I have yet to find a sandwich as good as the ones here.  They give you a generous amount of pickles with your sandwich, which helps cut through the fattiness of the meat and are overall a great addition to the meal."
,,,,,"The restaurant itself is a bit hectic because of amount of people and that it's not laid out in an intuitive manner, but they give you some semblance of direction when you get there.  For takeout, you get a ticket at the entrance, head to the middle of the counter to put in your order, and then head to the end of the counter to pay, all while shoveling through the masses.  Again, it can be a bit stressful."
,,,,,"Overall, Katz's is a staple and you really should try it if you're into corned beef and pastrami.  It's not cheap, but it's definitely worth it for the quality and amount of food you get."
,,,,,"Finally had a chance to visit and was not disappointed. I've heard about this place for so long but was skeptical because it seems like the sandwiches are just two pieces of bread with meat in the middle. But it was honestly the best sandwich I've ever had! The meat is so juicy, tender, and flavorful, and the mustard and pickles enhanced the meat flavor without overwhelming it. I split the pastrami rye with a friend and we were both full after."
,,,,,Best pastrami I have ever had in my life!
,,,,,I'll be sure to bring my family with me next time!
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"Came here first thing to beat the crowd, and I was glad I did! The boyfriend and I split the pastrami on rye, and splitting the sandwich was definitely the right call- those things are huge!! Tons of tender flavorful meat on soft sandwich bread, and that mustard that they have on the tables really put it over the top. It was a little salty, but that's what I expect in a pastrami sandwich. Overall, definitely worth the hype, there is a reason this is a New York institution."
,,,,,Best pastrami ever. Also the pickles are wild. I've been going here since I was a child but I don't think I truly appreciated it until now. One of the tastiest meals ever.
,,,,,"Katz's is great but that's obvious. The pastrami sandwiches are like no other. You just have to get past the crowds of people waiting in line, which is the biggest downside to this place. But go at least once -- it's worth the wait."
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,"Ok, you've all done it, or at least wanted to do it!  You know you have!  Sit in the famed ""Orgasm Booth"" from ""When Harry Met Sally""!  I'll admit that I've always wanted to sit in this famed booth from a iconic scene that was shot in the NYC landmark, Katz's Delicatessen!  Problem is, I've never walked in here that it's not just absolutely packed!  Typically it's a line out onto the sidewalk, but it's certainly worth the wait!"
,,,,,"Is it a bit touristy now?  Of course!  I for one typically find these places that are either famous from a movie or a Food Network show to actually be worth the hype!  The Pastrami on rye here is a glorious sandwich that is possibly three inches thick with fantastic pastrami!  There is no cutting corners with whatever meat you choose, but to finish a sandwich on your own is the bigger chore!  Getting the accompanying steak fries is a must, not just for their goodness, but the fact that it isn't the typical style of fries you'll find anymore.  The sandwiches are huge, easily shareable, and should be for the nearly $20 price tag!"
,,,,,"The one downside that I will attribute to the touristy catch of the place is the ""bouncers"" at the entrance.  Yep, always a couple of beefcake kinda guys that will give you a ticket upon entering, warn you not to lose it as you'll need it to exit, and believe me you'll NOT exit without it!  It comes across as a bit ""we are famous here and nobody will cheat us outta anything ""!  When in fact, is not the whole ""we only accept cash policy in most of NYC"" a bit on the deceitful side??"
,,,,,Pastrami on rye.  Worth every calorie!
,,,,,Staff: The guys that work on your order are pretty focused but they also seem pretty chill when you talk to them.  Nice people.  The front counter guy and the security guys are hilarious.  They'll tell you about some of the crazy stories of people losing their tickets if you ask and they have time to chat.  DO NOT LOSE YOUR TICKET!
,,,,,Food: I make it a point to come to Katz's every time i'm in NYC.  I've even waited in line during lunch on a weekend and I hate waiting in line.  Everyone I've come with also thinks Katz's has the best pastrami hands down.  I love this place so much I was excited to learn they ship and there are subscriptions if you're interested!  I'm totally going to order from them for the holidays! I can't wait!  I actually have never ordered anything else from this place because I love their pastrami so much.  The pastrami isn't salty like other places; it stands on its own with great flavor.  The meat is always very tender and juicy.  I'm drooling just thinking about it.  
,,,,,Definitely worth coming to again and again and again.
,,,,,"I know this is a super hyped tourist destination and for that reason I wasn't super stoked about going to this place as I knew that the lines and the prices would be over-the-top high. That being said, once I got there and got through the masses of people and the insane lines that we experienced at 1PM on a Saturday, I was not disappointed. "
,,,,,"I ordered Katz Pastrami Hot Sandwich which came out to about $22. This is a hefty price tag, but this sandwich is piled about 2.5 inches high with fresh, hot, delicious pastrami. It was definitely more than large enough to share with another person. I ate only half of mine and I was extremely full, so if you split it with someone the price isn't too bad. I got mine with swiss cheese, mustard, and mayo on the side. It also came with a side of pickles and cucumbers. "
,,,,,"Honestly, (much to my surprise because I don't really like sandwiches) this place was one of my favorites on my week-long trip to New York and I would say it is a must try! Don't let the lines or the tourists scare you away! "
,,,,,"Also, they have a part of the store where you can send salami home to your loved ones (or yourself.. I'm not judging), so if you're looking for a unique gift you can check that out."
,,,,,I understand why this place is famous and I love the old ny feel. the Harry met sally fame. I get it! And I understand why tourist love it... however I do think it's insanely overpriced and they aren't with the times ..WHERE ARE THE VEGAN OPTIONS?? Like wouldn't that be fantastic??
,,,,,Absolutely historic sandwiches. Katz has been open for over 100 years and I hope they never stop.
,,,,,"I made it a point to have a pastrami sandwich on my most recent trip to New York because I hadn't had one in all of my years of going. That's something you should always do when you travel, by the way - ALWAYS eat the local food that the place is known for. When you go to New York City you have to have bagels from a Jewish deli, you have to have pizza, you have to have hot dogs and halal street food, and you have to have a Deli sandwich."
,,,,,"Some of the people I was with weren't foodies or food tourists like I am, but once they got their sandwich they were so happy and understood taking the time to stop. These must have been the best sandwiches any of us had ever eaten and the pickles they use pair very well. "
,,,,,"It DOES take time, though. It's not a quick bite to eat at all - you take a ticket, you find a line to wait in, and the lines are long because the place is very popular and each order takes time as every item is cut to order. But once you get your sandwich it's just the best."
,,,,,"If you happen to be planning on taking a walking trip in the city, make sure you take the time to stop here."
,,,,,"I always thought Meg Ryan was faking that orgasm, but then I ate the reuben sandwich at Katz's Delicatessen."
,,,,,"Ate their about 2 years ago and of course ordered the pastrami sandwich and, man, I tell ya that samwich was super delicious! Had to take some of it home because it was too big! Highly recommended for anyone!"
,,,,,"Ok, wow. Totally worth $25 for a sandwich. "
,,,,,I was scared because the line was around the corner and I almost bailed but I'm happy I didn't because the line goes quickly! They take people in large groups.
,,,,,Got the pastrami on rye with sauerkraut and cheese . Fucking phenomenal. 
,,,,, 
,,,,,Definitely recommend splitting this because it's massive! 
,,,,,Pickles and stone ground mustard on the side. Love love love the mustard.
,,,,,"The staff here are the friendliest people you will encounter in NY city. They are all incredibly nice and call people adorable things like ""doll"" and ""sweetheart."" It's cuteness and friendliness overload. It really does have a neighborhood deli feel to it. I could have stayed for hours just to keep talking to the staff."
,,,,,"The food is amazing. I had the pastrami and it really was the best I've ever had. Ever. Of all time. I don't get the reviews of people who can't eat the whole thing because I inhaled that joker all by myself. I guess you just need to be committed to eating an entire months worth of calories in one sitting. So I don't recommend sharing, but keep in mind I can eat as much as a full grown linebacker. The sandwich was good and the pastrami was so perfect I couldn't have stopped eating even if I wanted to. The food here is every bit as good as everyone claims it is."
,,,,,Credit cards are accepted at the back register and it is VERY important you don't lose the ticket they give you at the door as that is what you will give the cashier after your meal so you can cash out. You'll also need your receipt/ticket to show to the guys at the door when you're ready to leave....something I wish I knew as I'm the worst at immediately throwing a receipt away once it's given to me. 
,,,,,"For an awesome NY City experience and amazing food, definitely don't miss out on Katz's Deli."
,,,,,We're so glad you enjoyed your experience here - there's nothing we love more than making new fans. Drop by again next time you're in town and give our Reuben a whirl!
,,,,,"Had a pastrami sandwich, it was huge! However, delicious had to take it to go and this was before 2020 and came here after a lounge. Its a big cafeteria with different options and you have to stand on line and order and then pay by the exit. I thought was a great, interesting experience and popular. It was packed and they give you to try while you wait."

,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,"I love this place & can't wait to go back & sit inside for an amazing meal. They are surprisingly patient with the vast array of questions folks pose, and the food is amazing, worth the wait & worth the cost."
,,,,,"Stick with the pastrami. Everything else is not as good. The half sour pickles are also good and purchased by the pint. Its authentic to the core which may rub people the wrong way. But accepting its rough around the edges, it's the best pastrami in the world."
,,,,,"Katz's... Famous for pastrami, corned beef, matzoh ball soup and a certain scene in the movie, ""When Harry met Sally."""
,,,,,"Are their sandwiches pricey? Yes. Are they worth it? I say an enthusiastic yes! This is New York City, minimum wage is $15.00 an hour and the cost of meat and rent goes up and up. Take a bite, swallow it and any concern about cost. A meal at Katz's is about savoring every bite, every sip of soup and the classic atmosphere of one of the last, true New York delis. If you check the hours, you will find they are open from Friday night to Sunday night. Consider going in late at night when things are less hectic and crowded."
,,,,,"The cutters provide generous samples of the sandwich meat that you order. Tip them a dollar and let them know if you want a lean cut, otherwise it will be a regular slice."
,,,,,"You can sit at the same table where ""Harry"" and ""Sally"" sat, however I do not recommend re-enacting their Katz's scene..."
,,,,,"Katy's history and food is deliciously fabulous, fun experience and a must when visiting NYC‼ I have lived here since 1990 and it took me 20 years and family visiting to get there. My advise is don't wait!"
,,,,,"First time at Katz's and was not disappointed. When I first arrived, I was totally confused about the ordering process (like everyone else who has never been there). But I ordered my food at different counters and got the idea on how to order. I ordered a Philly cheese steak and fries and my wife ordered a beef brisket sandwich. Both sandwiches were amazing and fries were above average. Everything tasted fresh and was very good."
,,,,,"Honestly, the food was delicious but it did not impress me. Before coming here I obviously knew the price I would be paying for these sandwiches, but after actually having the sandwich, I dont think it justifies the price. Nonetheless, I think Katz's is definitely worth trying just so you can say ""you've been here."" Ahah"
,,,,,"Upon entering, the staff gives you a ticket and make sure to hold on to them! Or else youll be charged a ridiculous amount if you loose it. After your butcher makes you your sandwich, the butcher will mark what you got on your ticket for you. Its like a receipt that you show to pay at the end of your meal. "
,,,,,My husband and I got the corn beef and the pastrami sandwich. Both tasted very flavorful and really melts in your mouth. The house-made mustard sauce with it made it even more better. 
,,,,,"Overall, great experience. Probably wouldn't be my must go place when visiting New York again, but I'm glad I stopped by. The staffs up front can be pretty rude but the rest of the workers were nice. Fast service when clearing up the table helps a lot because of how busy it can get here."
,,,,,My favorite place when I'm looking for pastrami & corn beef combination over stuff sandwiches the best in New York!
,,,,,"Wow. Took an hour to get inside. It was during the lunch rush, so that's probably not a good time to go. "
,,,,,"Atmosphere: Lots of people. They mean business here so know what you want when you get up to the counter. It is all self-service. They're divided by a few different stations: Grill, Cutter, Sides and Soda, Back. Step right up to the shortest line since it's a free for all once you get in. Be sure to keep the ticket you were given handy so that they can track what you got. "
,,,,,"Food: Attempted to get half Reuben and half of a Pastrami but that was no dice so I ended up with the Pastrami. Let me tell you this, IT WAS FIRE. Dang the meat was moist and great flavor. The bread i could almost do without, but it was a nice rye that came with it. I would have preferred toasted, but you do what they tell you to do. Comes with a side of cucumbers and pickles to wash down the salty sandwich. I grabbed a Cream Soda that reminded me of my childhood. "
,,,,,"Overall: I would go again, but not at peak hours."
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your meal - there's nothing we love more than making new fans. Though we do often serve a packed house, if you want to try dodging the crowds, definitely drop by during non-peak hours: breakfast, between lunch/dinner, or late nights on weekends. Hope to see you back again soon for another Reuben fix!"
,,,,,"Over the span of a year I was fortunate to come here three times! Each time was extremely pleasant. I came here twice by myself and a another time with friends so I tried a bit of everything. I highly recommend the pastrami, this one is a no-brainer. It is extremely tender, well salted, and comes out in between two buns and a some mustard. The servers are extremely helpful as well, I gave them a good tip after sampling some of their meats. Another one I liked was the brisket. Very juicy and fatty as well. Expect a line on busy days. They have a big seating area which is first come first serve."
,,,,,First time in New York and straight to Katz. Always heard about it so I gave it ago. Corned beef & Pastrami all I can say it is a fantastic sandwich. Great flavor right amount of fatty ness from the meat made it nice and moist.
,,,,,Wish we had a Katz in Los Angeles. The only thing was. I had notice all the other sandwiches seem to have more meat than mine and can soda a little warm.

,,,,,"As a native New Yorker, came here for the second time in my life today, and felt good to act like a tourist. The pastrami sandwich with the spicy mustard is top-notch, as is the matzoh ball soup. Love how it lives up to decades of hype. Love how you get to sample at the counter and wait for your full meal while it's made in front of you and settled on a tray. "
,,,,,We followed Katz's up with a trip to the nearby Tenement Museum. 
,,,,,Certified Tourist.
,,,,,5 Stars!!!!
,,,,,We drove by Kat'z at 11am and there was no line since it was so early we decided to come back for lunch.
,,,,,We got there around 1pm and there was a huge line but it moved fast.
,,,,,"You will have the option for to wait for a table with a server or to pick up your food self service, we decided to get a table with a server. Between the line outside and waiting for a table it was like 30 minutes and it was worth it!"
,,,,,"The food a Kat'z is delicious! So glad we got a waiter, he was funny and made great suggestions."
,,,,,"If is your first time there, the Katz Pastrami Hot Sandwich is a must! (Don't forget to add some Deli Mustard, it makes even more delicious, well if you like mustard lol)"
,,,,,"I order the half sandwich combo, which is the sandwich and a soup choice (I got the Matzo Ball). It was pretty filling."
,,,,,"And remember is a Deli, so if you decide to stay to eat there you will be sharing the table with some nice strangers :)"

,,,,,We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your first visit - we love making new fans. Hope to see you back again soon for another pastrami fix!
,,,,,Love this place always my go to for an awesome pastrami sandwich. Love it . My favorite is hot pastrami on Italian bread with Swiss and mustard . Can't get any closer to perfection then that..
,,,,,"Katz is organized. I mean, everyone knows this place has amazing kosher deli food. I was amazed with their system, a ticket when you enter, then a line to order, wait and then pay. The lines move fast and there are plenty of seats. I went right before COVID so I don't know what goes on in current conditions. Best kosher deli food in NYC."
,,,,,"Amazing food. I've been coming here since I was a little kid visiting New York City and I still come here with my parents now that we live here. Although, the system with the tickets at the front is sort of annoying, and I was mistaken for a child by the staff the last time I went there. Overall great experience, and pretty good service. I haven't been here since before COVID, but I remember the crowds were always huge and overwhelming. But, it's obviously not their fault, they're a huge success!"
,,,,,Stopped in late on a Friday night. Pleasantly surprised that the lines weren't too long. Was must husbands first time to NYC and he wanted to try out this popular staple. 
,,,,,Sandwich was good but not worth $23. Expected a sandwich twice the size for the price. And they only accept cash payment.
,,,,,"I lived in Manhattan for a couple months as a front line medical worker. I was looking forward to the food. What I learned was the only food really worth writing home about was the pizza, lox bagel sandwiches, and Katz. I had no idea pastrami could be so good. I later ordered from ""Katz's Deli"" in Houston, TX thinking it was affiliated with Katz in NYC. It was not, and the pastrami sandwich was nowhere near as good. I guess you can try to imitate it but it just won't be the same."
,,,,,"Service is great, very spacious place and food is not bad . The issue I have with this place is the hype. This is nothing I have never tried before and it does not have a special twist to it. I ate half of it and I have to say it is overpriced for what it is. You have to be a real meat lover and you have to love eating a lot. Not for me and not going back for a $27 meal."
,,,,,"Came in on a Sunday around 12:30pm, and the line moved quickly. The pastrami was really good, although I remember the last time I was here a few years ago, it was more amazing.. it costs $25 for a sandwich which can easily be split between 2 people, and they give u some pickles. They have old fashion soda (I think it was like $2) it was good. "
,,,,,"They give every single person a ticket at the entrance where they write down what each person gets, and as u leave, they read each ticket and charge u as u leave. DONT throw ur ticket away, even if one person pays for everyone's food on one ticket. "
,,,,,There's plenty of extra seating in the back
,,,,,"The seating along the wall is only if ur going to have a waiter serve u.... Mostly, everyone comes in, finds the shortest line and ask for ur sandwich, then find a seat, eat and head towards the exit with ur ticket."
,,,,,This place was... AMAZING! The sandwich was delicious and the lemonade. Oh! Katz's Delicatessen was so breathtaking. It was really enjoying to eat this sandwich with the delicious lemonade! The sandwich was so huge that me and my step mom only got one and split it! I was so excited to go to this spot and it definitely passed my expectations! I forgot to mention! They have breathtaking chocolate cakes! Anyways this spot is very very very good and everyone should try it!

,,,,,"If you're anywhere within the tri-state area and don't make the effort to try Katz's pastrami on rye, you're doing this life thing wrong. The big, fat matzoh ball soup. The heaps (and I mean heaps) of meat smothered with perfectly spiced mustard.  I prefer mine with Swiss and kraut. And the pickles. OH, THE PICKLES! Do yourself a favor and go to Katz's. Like, now."
,,,,,"I really wanted to love this place, but ended up just finding it a solid okay. If you've never been the process can be a bit overwhelming (depending on how crowded it is). I think most reviewers have gone over the process and the people at Katz's are pretty good about explaining it. "
,,,,,"The food was okay (we had the pastrami sandwich) especially for the price, but I feel like Katz's is more about an experience then anything else. I am glad we came and had the experience, but I don't think I would return."
,,,,,"Pretty good sandwiches, distinguished by its humongous portion... and the environment is very friendly even though its joined by people from all over the world..."
,,,,,"To me the price is a bit much for this sandwich, and it doesnt look very hygienic on the other side of the counter... the unwanted parts of meat were just dumped on the floor, knowing how dirty and infested NYC is, this could be very very disgusting even if they clean it every day..."
,,,,,"I got the Katz's Pastrami Sandwich and it was savory, juicy, filling, salty, mouthwatering, and flavorful. I also got the Matzo ball soup, the Matzo ball was delightful and the soup itself was a little too salty but nevertheless delicious. The only reason I'm giving my review a 4/5 is because I paid $22.95 for the sandwich... I understand the brand factor of the restaurant and I would probably still pay that much for this sandwich, but it's still $22.95"
,,,,,"Katz is definitely something special. And I'm sure most people know that by now. Although it was confusing to order at first, I was able to put in my order almost immediately once I figure out how to order. Fortunately, there were a lot of tables still open. "
,,,,,"They give you a ticket as soon as you enter the building, and they tell you to keep that ticket until you exit the deli. After you place your order, they will mark on the ticket what you ordered, so when going to pay at the very end, they will ask you for the ticket so they can charge you. If you want to pay cash you heads towards the front. They do take credit cards but you have to go towards the rear to pay for a credit card. It's that simple guys!"
,,,,,"As for their pastrami, this is truly not your ordinary thin sliced pastrami with cheese and mustard. Here you'll get a very thick and juicy cut slices of pastrami with mustard on rye. The pastrami has a nice smoky flavor and some fat to help enhance the flavor of the pastrami. Most people share this, I don't really need to share. I'm a very greedy person. We also ordered the corned beef on rye. Never been a fan of just Corned beef, should of ordered their Reuben. For sure next time. Because there will be a next time. They also hook it up with a little plate of pickles. "
,,,,,"If you're really intimated of this place, they also have tables reserved for waiter service. There you can just take a seat and a waiter will take your order from your seat, if that's your type of thing."
,,,,,"I mean, I guess this place is cool. It's what you expect it to be. "
,,,,,"I hadn't ever been here and hadn't ever had fresh pastrami or bologna; just a heads up, if you haven't had it before, it will absolutely clog your arteries. "
,,,,,"And do *not* skip out on the mustard. You'll need it to cut through all the grease on the meat. It took me like 3 or 4 days to eat the one sandwich I got and, even then, I ended up tossing some of it. Seriously, you'll feel weighed down for days."
,,,,,The egg creams are delish so def get one of those.
,,,,,Overall:
,,,,,Employees are friendly. 
,,,,,"Other than the massive amount of grease, the food is pretty decent."
,,,,,"The prices are a bit more than you'll pay somewhere that ISN'T Katz Deli, but who would want to go there anyway?"
,,,,,"[Intro Disclaimer: As a Toronto foodie, I ventured out to New York for the first time in my life with high expectations and a fully planned itinerary dedicated towards trying all the best foods in New York City!]"
,,,,,"I must say, I'm not a deli connoisseur so I've really only had Caplansky's (in Toronto) to compare but Katz's was absolutely delicious. We ordered a pastrami sandwich since that's what all the buzz was about and it did not disappoint. The meat was so so tender and juicy and flavourful.. and fat (I could've appreciated less fat but I guess that's what makes the overall sandwich so flavourful). The sandwich was generously overflowing with pastrami and it was super filling. I loved the complimentary pickles on the side which was a nice refreshing textural and palate change when the meat sweats started to get to me. That said, I'd probably recommend sharing the sandwich with a +1 not because you can't finish one on your own but because you start to appreciate it less when you've had enough meat and grease."
,,,,,"Wow this place is amazing. I would eat here every week if I lived in the city. A little on the expensive end, but I'll eat a cup of noodles if it means getting this more often."
,,,,,"When I went I opted for the Reuben on rye. I'm not sure if that was a faux-pas or not for my first time, but it was amazing. I panicked when asked if I wanted both half sours and full sours. I feel confident now putting my flag in the ground: half sours are a mistake. Full sours all the way. Give me a tasty pickle or a cucumber, and not some bastardization that's neither. "
,,,,,"But yeah, dope sandwiches, interesting experience. Don't lose your ticket!"
,,,,,Hello Humongous Sized Pastrami Sandwiches! 
,,,,,"Being practically as old as New York itself, Katz's has a special place in every true New Yorkers heart. "
,,,,,"A big place with big flavor and powerful impact on the city, Kat's is must visit for anyone who eats meat and loves sandwiches. "
,,,,,They're open late and work fast. Be sure to visit this fine New York City landmark if you're just visiting.
,,,,,"Fantastic! A classic and incredible experience. We got the classic pastrami sandwich is pastrami, mustard and rye but it's so flavorful you don't need anything else. Delicious!"
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,"They only do delivery and takeout during COVID season but this doesn't stopped us from having the BEST pastrami in New York if not in the world! Definitely worth it! In store, they implement social distancing as well."
,,,,,The pastrami isn't a joke and deserves its excellent reputation! Although I would never pay $22.95 for a sandwich but this time was an exception! The funny guy serving allowed me to try some meat before deciding which sandwich to get; and the meat was suuuuper tender with the perfect amount of flavour. 
,,,,,"The place was absolutely packed inside, choose whether to sit at waiter-serving tables or head around to the back to try and nab a table yourself! You are given pink entry tickets when you first go in, so don't lose them because they are also your exit tickets. You pay after you finish your meal, either by card at the counter or by cash at the entrance/exit door. Choose free tap water or you can purchase drinks from behind the counter. Can't finish your massive sandwich? You can bring it to the counter to get it wrapped up to go :)"
,,,,,"It was a great experience at Katz, definitely a spot to check out!"
,,,,,my experience -
,,,,,"with over 11,000+ reviews on yelp, i knew what to expect, what to order, and how the system goes in this place. but just to reiterate, i will go through the experience here to hopefully help others out! i came on a thursday around noon and i was expecting a huge line out the door, but we were fine! "
,,,,,when you walk in -
,,,,,each person at your party gets a ticket whether every individual orders or not. there is someone standing there making sure you all get a ticket.
,,,,,"if you want to order on your own, you walk towards the right to the cutting stations. if you want to have a server and more of a ""sit down"" experience you go to the waitress on the left. it is super clear and easy "
,,,,,cutting station -
,,,,,"for us, we wanted to experience the classic ""you go and order it yourself"""
,,,,,there are 6 cutting stations and you choose whichever one you want. each one only had maybe 1-2 people in line. you can ask your meat cutter for samples of the meat you want to try. my friend and i wanted to taste the pastrami before ordering it just to make sure we liked it. he carved out 1 big slice and 2 smaller ones. 
,,,,,ordering - 
,,,,,"they give you many options and it is very clear up above. if you use yelp you can view the menu beforehand and understand what you want. for us, we knew we wanted the pastrami on rye with ruben. HOWEVER, if i were to go back i would NOT get the ruben."
,,,,,"once you tell your cutter what you want, he makes it and adds pickles & cucumbers on the side. you hand him one ticket and he writes the price on it and hands it back. "
,,,,,seating -
,,,,,"if you have more than one person, i would suggest having one person find a table while you order. for us, we had 3 people and we didn't have a problem finding a table since it is a huge space but i could see it hard to find a table when it's super packed on a weekend. the good side of it is, you won't spend more than 20 minutes eating here once you get the food and table so it should clear up fast. "
,,,,,now what you've been waiting for. THE FOOD.
,,,,,"we got two pastrami on rye with ruben and i think it was overkill. the pastrami itself was so tender and flavorful, it did not need the cheese and sourceawl to add to it. i never knew pastrami could be so flavorful and tender so i thought it would need the extra flavoring but i was so wrong! their mustard + meat is already enough. it is a lot of meat and if you aren't a meat lover it is definitely overwhelming. the rye bread did get soggy in the center and i do wish it was toasted. because there is so much meat is is super hard to pick up. i don't know if getting sourdough or french bread would help because it might be harder to bite since they're bigger pieces of bread but it might not have been as soggy. "
,,,,,"as for the meat it is something that is not your classic pastrami. i did not even know pastrami could taste this good! for $25 you can definitely split this with someone, but be aware!! it is VERY messy and your sandwich will most likely break."
,,,,,"so flavorful and melts in your mouth, hard to describe just give it a try! "
,,,,,it is a lot to finish on your own so i do suggest splitting it with someone. my brother actually got one to go to bring on the flight and they package it very well with the sauce on the side. easy to bring home !! they do a wonderful job at keeping it fast & delicious. would come back to try it without the Ruben.
,,,,,they do have a combo choice where you are able to choose two types of sandwiches but if you want to split it i think it'll be really messy because there's so much meat and so little bread that it'll break apart.
,,,,,PAYING - 
,,,,,"without reading other reviews, i would not understand the system. if you pay at the front it is all cash! it is whatever is written on your ticket + tax. remember, everyone needs a ticket to leave or else there is a $50 fine."
,,,,,"if you are paying with card, it is towards the back where the sit down sandwiches are. it is not near the cutters but on the side of them. again, GO TO THE BACK IF YOU ARE PAYING WITH CARD!! "
,,,,,overall -
,,,,,"would i come back, yes! most definitely. would i eat a whole sandwich by myself? most definitely not. "
,,,,,"this is something that will fill you up and it is a lot of meat so you do not want to eat it too often. however, when you're on vacation it is the best time to try new food and that's what i did! with over 11,000 reviews it is almost disrespectful not to give it a try! i would say because of the messy ness of the sandwich and the price i would give it a 4/5 but the meat is definitely a 5/5!"
,,,,,SUMMARY - 
,,,,,rye bread gets a little soggy
,,,,,very messy
,,,,,get it without the Ruben 
,,,,,try the meat (2-3 pieces)
,,,,,lots of flavor and very tender
,,,,,does not need extra flavor or else it is overkill 
,,,,,$49.90 + tax for 2 pastrami on rye w/ ruben 
,,,,,definitely can share 
,,,,,side of pickles too salty
,,,,,A New York classic . The best corned beef and matzoh ball soup.
,,,,,"This place never cease to amaze. That corned beef! That pastrami! Out of this world juicy, tender and flavorful. Do yourselves a favor and treat yourselves. Thank you, Mr. Dell, for keeping this place a true NY gem. 5 stars all around."
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear that you've enjoyed your meals here - our long-time fans are the backbone of our restaurant, and make our jobs so rewarding and so fun. Hope to see you back again soon for another corned beef and pastrami fix!"
,,,,,"Let the pitchforks come.  I appreciate that this restaurant is a NY landmark and the price and hype reflect the legacy of pop culture instilled at this restaurant, but from a food and value perspective, their signature sandwich(es) are overpriced."
,,,,,"The pastrami is amazing, hands down the quality of the meat, size of the cut, and way it is prepared is easily the best that I've had.  However, the bread tasted pretty basic, I can only imagine how amazing it would be if the bread was buttered and toasted."
,,,,,"Still, if you have seen any of the shows or films that have featured this place, it is definitely worth the visit to ""come"" here at least once. ;)"
,,,,,"I came by on a Sunday morning and was really scared for a crowd, but thank goodness it wasn't! I was confused about the ticketing system but the people working there were helpful (make sure you keep your ticket all the way until you leave, because they collect those). It's a very spacious spot with lots of seats, AC, and a bathroom, so you'll feel comfortable."
,,,,,"I got the classic hot Pastrami sandwich. The man cutting up the meat for me was nice enough to let me try it without me having to ask. Easily ordered that. The sandwich comes with pickled and cucumber and mustard. The price isn't cheap but it's worth it! Although I wish it came with some sort of sauce cause some parts of the sandwich were pretty dry and the mustard didn't cut it for me for the entire meal (but this dryness is just my personal opinion), it was an amazing sandwich and I can see what the hype is all about. The fatty parts of the sandwich were my favorite!!"
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your meal, but sorry that you found your sandwich less than perfect. We try to accommodate all of our customers' preferences by having a cutter interaction at the counter - if you'd like a juicer slice next time, just ask and they'll be happy to oblige. Hope to see you back again soon!"
,,,,,"Had to try this place since everyone talks about it. super old school and brings you back in the days. The line can be extremely long but guess we can eat the right time and there was barely a line. Before getting in, they give you a ticket and you go up to them and place your order and that is your ticket out ! If you have any questions about the pastrami and etc.. they are happy to answer it and even give you samples before you order it. Each sandwich is about $25. It's a very simple sandwich just pastrami and bread but super loaded. To me, It's a bit dry and I love sandwiches such as IKE's place with more toppings . would I come back? Prob not for $25. But it is a place to check out if you're ever in New York~~~"
,,,,,"Their ordering system is a nightmare. We were directed to go to Cutter #7, but he just stared at us and said to go to #6. That wasn't actually open either so about 15 of us had to merge with about 10 in line #5. So what appeared to be no wait other than about 4-5 people in each line turned out to be 30 minutes of disorganization by Katz. They are constantly telling the guests where to go, what line to stand in, and they seem to be frustrated that people don't get it. They don't get it because it's flawed. "
,,,,,"On to the food. Pastrami sandwich on rye was fantastic. Definitely a sandwich worthy of the hype. Is it worthy of the price? No. There probably isn't a sandwich that would ever be worth more than $12. It's a sandwich for crying out loud. So $21.95 is absurd. Cash only is also absurd. I get it from a business sense, but the 3-4% you pay to a credit card company has more than been covered with the outrageous pricing. Now it's just greed and another discomfort for the guest. Today's diner is looking to use Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, and other tech related forms of payment, and this place still hasn't caught up with the credit card movement from decades ago. "
,,,,,"The bagel and cream cheese was okay. Nothing spectacular. And the cheesecake was not work ordering again. Very dry, not creamy at all, and not made on the premises either. The dill pickles were good, but the half sours were more of a not sour at all. Also known as a cucumber."
,,,,,Quick Summary:
,,,,,"- Line is long, and it depends on luck (customers order one order, but I lined up where a customer ordered four sandwiches, so the slicing took a while)"
,,,,,- Card is accepted.
,,,,,"- Viewing the wall and seeing ""the forever reserved table"" is part of the entertainment"
,,,,,"- The sandwich is huge, and it's all meat, even I who like meat ordered a soup side"
,,,,,- The matzo ball soup became salty near the end
,,,,,"- inside is crowded, so it can be a struggle to find seating"
,,,,,I've known this restaurant thanks to many episodes on Food Network and Traveling Channels. 
,,,,,"The ordering style is very unique. If I can provide an example, it as if I went to line up to ride in a small amusement park ride. Once you enter the restaurant, you receive a ticket and you line up in one of the many slicers, who stand behind the counter (That day, there were seven slicers). There, the slicers slice up the meat on the spot. "
,,,,,"Depending on the slicer, they will ask different questions. For my friend, she was asked a choice if she wanted mustard in her sandwich. The slicer I had didn't ask, so I needed to pour mustard on my own. "
,,,,,"The sandwich is very large, so instead only ordering a sandwich, I ordered a 1/2 sandwich with a soup side. There were three different types of soups to choose from, and I ordered the matzo ball soup. This was also a dish that one of the food stars spotted their light on. "
,,,,,"The pastrami sandwich was very delicious. The meat was extremely soft and tender. No teeth required. Just smash your lips together and the meat is cut through. It was that soft. It is good on its own, but I love mustard, so it tasted even better with the tang of the mustard. The pickles were good too - despite me not fond of anything cucumbers. "
,,,,,"The matzo ball soup was a surprise. It was good for several spoonfuls. The matzo ball was tender and it tasted like a soft and gigantic meatball. However, near the bottom of the bowl, it grew salty. I had a cup of water as my aid as I slurped, and drank another cup of water after finishing the soup."
,,,,,"After clearing the plate, the checkout is done by either near the entrance/exit (if you have cash), or at the end of the counter of the slicers (where customers order drinks). The price is written on the ticket and the order is completed. With the ticket still in hand (with a stapled receipt) you leave the restaurant by returning the ticket. "
,,,,,"The restaurant warns to have the ticket at all times, even if you don't order. I wonder what happens if you lose it on the way?"
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,Saw this awesome video on Facebook about some Deli named Katzs'.... flew out from Denver at midnight and ended up here by 10am. 
,,,,,WORTH IT! Hands down the best pastrami my test buds have ever been blessed with. 
,,,,,"Now you need to know a few things.. first be quick on your feet, the line starts early and moves fast. Second, keep your ticket with you through the whole meal, and use it to pay afterwards. Lastly, know your order when you get to the counter! These guys don't mess around, they are here to serve you amazing foods quickly!"
,,,,,And if you need some direction ask for a sample slice of some meat and that will make up your mind in a heartbeat
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your first visit, there's nothing we love more than making new fans. If you're ever craving a pastrami fix without a plane ride, we also offer free two-day shipping on orders over $100. Hope to see you back again soon!"
,,,,,"Disclaimer, I've been coming to Katz's over 40 years now...  I've been there with parents several times. It's been a while since I now reside in Atlanta.  Stopped by Friday morning and got a lean corned beef and a pastrami. The quality is still top notch. The service was awesome. The guy making my sandwich's carves some meat for me to sample while I waited.  The flavor is amazing. I love Rueben sandwiches and no place is Katz's. During COVID-19 you get the food to go but it was still and awesome trip down memory land and the sandwiches which fed 5 people were a huge hit with the next generation!!!  I love Katz's !!!"
,,,,,"Please please don't order delivery from them. I ordered through yelp, order was confirmed, 2 hours later nothing came. I tried to contact them, Grubhub (order was processed through Grubhub on yelp) tried to contact them. Absolutely no response. Unbelievable. Irresponsible business."
,,,,,"A true NY institution. With so many reviews, I won't add anything that hasn't already been said, but I think it's a must-try. The pastrami is amazing and unlike anything I've tasted outside of NY. The ticket/ordering system is a bit quirky (just hold on to your ticket), but I strongly recommend getting the pastrami on rye with mustard. One order is really enough for two!"
,,,,,"Visiting NYC after taking a cruise out of Jersey.  Absolutely had to find an OG deli to satisfy our sandwich craving.  Checked the Yelp hits we decided on Katz's.  After a short 15 minute wait, we browsed the menu and ordered the Pastrami, the Reuben, and a Matzo Ball Soup.  I can't stress how impressed we were.  The meat was fall apart in your mouth tender and expertly seasoned.  One of the best Pastrami's I've ever had.  The Reuben was loaded with corned beef and Sauerkraut.  Amazing.  As far as the soup goes, holy Matzo ball Batman!"
,,,,,"Be forewarned you'll probably hit a crowd.  We went on a snowy December afternoon and it was packed, but worth it."
,,,,,This is probably the most amazing restaurant i have ever been to with brilliant atmosphere 
,,,,,"I love their well prepared food, highly recommended services. I will fore sure be back to Katz's and i will be accompanied by my fellows."
,,,,,This is probably the most amazing restaurant i have ever been to with brilliant atmosphere 
,,,,,"I love their well prepared food, highly recommended services. I will fore sure be back to Katz's and i will be accompanied by my fellows."
,,,,,One of the very iconic places to stop by when in NYC. I have never been here so we decided to come by on a weekday morning for an early lunch. 
,,,,,Everyone was at work so there was no crowd or much of a wait. Located about a block from another famous Jewish deli so we just came here the next day after going to that one.
,,,,,"Be sure to grab one of the tickets the ""security guard"" hands you when you walk in. Don't lose the ticket because that's how they keep track what you ordered and how they charge you when you pay for your food. "
,,,,,"As you walk up to the counter, it's just like you seen them on t.v, staff working the meats, asking next person to step up so they can get their food, employees talking smack to each other etc. Be sure to read the signs above each counter as sandwiches are over here, and if you want other items, it's over there.  "
,,,,,"We decided to get the popular hot pastrami sandwich and a bowl of their matzo ball soup. As they are making your sandwich, they gave me a slice or two of the pastrami to taste, it was very good!!! Staff dude was real cool, only took him a few minutes to fix up my order. "
,,,,,"Pastrami sandwich was what I hoped it would be, super flavorful, peppery, super moist, meaty & fatty at the same time, and they gave a pretty good amount of it on your sandwich. They only put mustard on it, so that was fine with me. Yea, I can see why this sandwich is so popular, it was pretty darn good!  "
,,,,,"Matzo ball soup was very good too, Jewish mother's chicken noodle soup and it totally hit the spot! You get a huge matzo ball, it was very good being so light & fluffy, soup itself was tasty as well. We killed this as well! "
,,,,,"I'm assuming if you order a sandwich, it comes with a side order of their pickles, those tasty little briny cucumbers were very good as a side and they know you can't eat a sandwich without a pickle to chew on too. "
,,,,,"After you get your food, go sit down wherever, the spot is marked where When Harry Met Sally was filmed, in case you desire to sit there and have an orgasm. Celeb photos all over the wall so be sure to check that out.  "
,,,,,"Prices are pretty expensive, especially their sandwiches, they can be up to $20 - $25 for a sandwich. Yea, I got the same reaction too! "
,,,,,"Glad we came by to check it out, have a delicious sandwich and visit this NYC landmark."
,,,,,"Everyone knows about this place and we heard a ton about this place. We stumbled upon this place after having some bagels over at Russ & Daughters. As soon as we got in, it felt like we were entering a club haha. There was a ton a people, so finding out where to line-up and stand was a little hectic. But, there were people directing you where to go. The line didn't take too long and we were also given some samples to try the delicious pastrami that they served."
,,,,,"I would say that the pastrami sandwich we had was very very good. For the price you pay for the size of the sandwich, I would say its not really worth it. You are paying about $25 for a small sized pastrami sandwich. The meat was really tender and delicious, but, in my opinion, it was not worth the price. Overall, I really liked the décor and environment of Katz. I had a great experience here and would definitely be back!"
,,,,,"The tall tales of the greatest pastrami on earth are true!  Usually when going to an eatery as famous as this one, it is a let down, but not here.  This place serves true meat perfection.  This is the gold standard of deli meat and it's not even fair to other meats to be judged against it.  You will be thinking about this pastrami long after you eat it if you are a foodie.  I will never visit New York without stopping in for this magical meat between two slices of bread.  So simple, yet so incredible, I dream about the day I will savor this again.  Atmosphere is really cool too, but the strange green ticket system is weird."
,,,,,We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your visit - hope to see you back again soon for another pastrami fix!
,,,,,Waited in a huge line to try out the deli and it was worth the wait!! It's the only meal we ate for the whole day... each sandwich can feed two people at least
,,,,,Come on you know the vibes. KATZ is a New York staple if you dont like it get out of here lol.
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,Hm pretty disappointed in this spot! Im born and raised in NYC and have never tried Katz's. I finally hd the chance to and was so excited. 
,,,,,"The place itself is huge luckily. When you arrive, youre given a ticket and told to start on line. There were 2 people in front of me and i waited maybe 15 min. The workers seem to take their time surprisingly. "
,,,,,The sandwiches range from $20+. Its actually insane. We got a tounge sandwich w mustard on a hero and it was $24! I thought were were gonna be given some family style sized sandwich but its a regular deli size. I truly cant see the prices being justified other than for tourist trap. 
,,,,,The place has its original bones but can give a dingey feeling. The food itself was good but def not worth $24 for ONE sandwich.
,,,,,Meats are incredible!!! Worth every penny and the wait!! You may also ask to try the meats before ordering to be sure as to what you want.
,,,,,Credit card charged but order cancelled. We were eagerly awaiting our katzs order for memorial day and they cancelled it the friday before delivery.. They said undeliverable despite taking the order AND  our money. They said they called but there is no record of the call. Customer service provided nothing but the statement that they tried to call. Our trust in this online retailer is shattered.
,,,,,"The best pastrami sandwich in the city, price has gone up over the years but hey it's worth it, it's the only place when I think of a pastrami sandwich, where else would you go."
,,,,,"A New York staple. Anything you get, the pastrami, the cornbeef, the tongue; you name it you will not be disappointed. Yes, of course they're known for their pastrami and for good reason. Its stacked high, its bursting with flavor and how it's rested between the rye and mustard could easily be one of my final meals of my life. I think what people should give a try are their knish and french fries also great!"
,,,,,Great eats you can never go wrong with a KATZ sandwich if you're ever in the area stopping by is a must you can't come to the lower east side and not have a KATZ
,,,,,Whoa!  A New York landmark with sandwiches as big as your head!!  As a tourist it can first seem overwhelming to go to Katz because it is a crowded place full of New Yorkers knowing what they want.  Go anyway!  It is not to be missed!  Legendary.
,,,,,Step in and get your ticket and Do Not Lose it!  Filter into a crowded line and make friends.  Watch the sandwiches that leaving the line to better decide on a choice.  Any choice is guaranteed delicious!  The fries are outstanding.  Portions are large and can easily be split.
,,,,,I had the brisket.  It was fabulous!!  The corn beef and Reuben looked awesome and will be my next choices. One of the best places to get the real New York vibe.  People watching is a must.
,,,,,"""When Harry Met Sally"" fame with her favorite orgasmic sandwich.  I'll have what she is having...."
,,,,,So this place can get a little bit crowded but how can it not !? the pastrami sandwiches are to die for! I know you usually only eat a pastrami sandwich with just maybe mustard and then pickles on the side but i'm a little extra and love other toppings on my sandwiches such as lettuce and tomatoes and so on. I never knew how good and fresh a pastrami sandwich could be until I came here and tried theirs. With the price you are paying for this sandwich I would only hope they give you enough meat. 
,,,,,To me the price was a bit over the top considering it's a pastrami sandwich but Understand it is new york and meat isn't cheap lol. However if you want extra toppings added like lettuce and tomatoes it does cost more so be prepared to spend at least around $20-$30 maybe. I Haven't been here since 2017 so prices could have changed. I always suggest getting a pastrami sandwich (hot sandwich not cold) on rye bread.
,,,,,The pastrami sandwich and the matzo ball soup are truly delicious! Definitely live up to the hypeOne sandwich can probably feed two people with small appetite. The cheesecake tastes mediocre and is a bit too small. Other than the dessert everything is good!
,,,,,"Katz's is New York, and New York is Katz's. A hot dog with ketchup, mustard, and relish, and a Dr. Brown's Cel-Ray soda. There is nothing quite as satisfying. I cannot wait to bring all of my friends here as soon as possible to celebrate one of my favorite New York institutions."

,,,,,"The meat stimulated different parts of my brain, it's a meat bomb dropped in my mouth. The only thing I would change is get a better bread."
,,,,,"As good as it gets, Pastrami on Rye, mustard is the way to go! It comes with pickle, add on a side of Matzo Ball Soup and you call it a day, a happy day!"
,,,,,"Even when we came on at 2:30 PM! The 7 Cutter lines are still jammed packed, and cluster AF!"
,,,,,"It's stuffy and if you are claustrophobic, you won't be able to come here! I got anxiety just to get in line."
,,,,,My pastrami sandwich + Matzo Ball Soup = $30.40 if you pay with CC another $3 fee! 
,,,,,"Tasty, juicy, and delicious! But have been lived in New York before! There's other places for you to visit! Equally as good and a whole lot less tourists! "
,,,,,"NOTE: Avoid Wednesday & Friday to take a taxi/Lyft here, it's TRUCK DELIVERY days in Manhattan. Taxi/Lyft will take at least 30 mins just to bring you here from Chelsea/Midtown/Time Square!   "
,,,,,Please TIP THE GUY that makes your sandwich $3-$5! He's the one who gives you sampling meats! Take care of the people take care of you! You'll be surprise how it's getting more back!
,,,,,"I had some friends visiting town and had never been to Katz even though I live in Lower East Side so I figured it would be a good time to try it out. I didn't realize how large this place would be, as I was just expecting a typical deli. When my friends and I saw the prices for the pastrami sandwich we decided to just order one and split it and then grab food elsewhere afterwards. This was definitely a good idea, because even though the sandwich was delicious, it was probably a lot more fat and oil than we're used to."
,,,,,We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your first visit - drop by again soon and give our Reuben a try!
,,,,,I have a good friend of mine who used to live in New York who insisted I try the pastrami sandwich at this place. 
,,,,,"First off, look at their reviews, those reviews don't lie..."
,,,,,"Second, OMG! The pastrami is on a different level of amazing! As you walk in they give you a ticket and you walk to different counters who serve different things. We got a hotdog sandwich and a pastrami sandwich. The hotdog comes with tomatoes, onion, peppers and is really good. "
,,,,,Let's talk about the pastrami which I ended up going back for and get another 1/4 pound and have it for dessert! Lol
,,,,,The pastrami literally melts in your mouth since it's amazingly tender. They make sure they trim most of the fat and leave the perfect amount...
,,,,,The pickles and the french fries are also great and a must have.
,,,,,"Definitely a New York institution. Even so, this was my first time here and it was everything I thought it would be. Crowded, crazy, loud, exciting and fun. The 'Cutters' were like artists with their knives. My fellow customers were just as excited as I was to be there and cop one of these legendary sandwiches. I chose the hot pastrami on rye and enjoyed every bit of it. My 'cutter' let me sample the corned beef and I was sorry I didn't get a second sandwich. "
,,,,, 
,,,,,"No matter when you go, be prepared to wait in line.  Hedge your bet and have a friend stand in another line for a 'cutter'. This will reduce your wait time. I stood in line 4 and my friend stood in line 5 and we both had the same amount of people in front of us but when I reached my 'cutter' he still had two customers in front of him so I just placed his order with my 'cutter'. "
,,,,,Next trip; The Reuben!
,,,,,And tip your cutter.
,,,,,Best pastrami sandwich ever! Enough for two unless your really starving. A little on the expensive side since it's considered a tourist attraction. But still great. Can't beat it. Worth the trip.
,,,,,HOLY SMOKES! Katz's is an absolute must when in New York. My week long trip was basically a foodie adventure and this was definitely one of my favorite meals.
,,,,,"My friends and I came right at lunch time, but were surprised to see only a few people in line. This is because they have the most efficient process ever! There are about 8 different cutters to take your order and prep your food, and then you pay after you finish eating your meal as you are heading out. Don't lose your ticket! There are also tons of seating."
,,,,,My boyfriend and I split one pastrami sandwich (because we indulged in 5 meals on our last full day in NY). The pastrami is freaking amazing. So tender and flavorful and just beautiful. The fatty slices melt in your mouth. Their pickles and cucumber add the perfect crunch too. Glad I got to squeeze in some veggies into my system :P My only gripe is that their bread was just whatever. Toasted dutch crunch or perhaps sourdough would make it the perfect sandwich. But still 5 stars because their pastrami is just that good. I can die happy now.
,,,,,It's insane how packed this place is with pastrami zombies even in the middle of the afternoon on a Friday.
,,,,,"We waited outside the cafe for 10 minutes, then inside in front of the counter for 15 minutes, desperate to taste this hyped up pastrami sandwich."
,,,,,We finally got our hands on this $22 pastrami sandwich to go (the seating area was too packed).
,,,,,"I loved the volume of pastrami packed into this sandwich, and I'll admit that it's the best pastrami I've ever had (although I am not a pastrami expert by any means). It's juicy, perfectly seasoned, and tasted like real meat rather than artificial deli meat. The sandwich bread, mustard, and pickles were pretty standard."
,,,,,"I definitely enjoyed the sandwich, but I wouldn't say that it's worth $22 and lining up for 25min to go back a second time."
,,,,,They literally live up to all the hype!
,,,,,"Totally worth the $23.00 for a pastrami sandwich ! They slice it to order for you and cut you off a couple pieces to try first ... the sour pickles are the way to go rather than the sweet . You won't find a better pastrami anywhere . My wife had the turkey and although very moist and good , it's Still turkey !!!"
,,,,,"Disappointing. Salty, dry, bland, surpisingly unappetizing. Felt super dizzy and dehydrated like eating a sandwich purely made with MSG. Like chewing salty wax. Not worth the wait. Extremely overpriced and overrated. I wonder how on earth that this deli earned its reputation over decades."

,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,"Absolutely love this place! My hubby and I first went here on our second visit to NY. We went to another landmark restaurant with pastrami and corn beef sandwiches, but when we came here, we were sold. We finally got a chance to bring our kids back and they loved it as well. The portions are huge and everyone gets fed and full. We love Katz!"
,,,,,"This was my third time ordering Katz through their nationwide shipping service. I ordered a couple pounds of pastrami and brisket, along with all of the trimmings and dessert for my husband as a Valentine's Day present. Katz shipped on time for second day air delivery on Friday the 12th, but due to weather delays, UPS didn't deliver until today. But even with a several day delay, the food was packed so well on ice that everything was still properly refrigerated and safe to eat and nothing went to waste! Major props to Katz for their shipping services and awesome customer service, along with delicious food!"
,,,,,We're so glad to hear that you've enjoyed your meals - we're thrilled to be able to ship a taste of New York cross country. Hope to see you back again soon!
,,,,,"So I know everyone talks about Kat'z Deli and it's definitely a staple in NYC. I personally don't think a sandwich is worth 25 dollars. You get a good amount of the food but not enough to justify the cost. I am basing my review on the pastrami on rye that I got. (Recommended by a friend) The food taste great, great seasoning, and because it's during the pandemic, lines weren't that long. I think everyone should try Katz at least once, but I wouldn't go looking for it."
,,,,,All 5 star rave reviews are right! I was never a fan of pastrami until I had a hot pastrami sandwich on rye at Katz's.  I guess I'm a pastrami lover when it comes from Katz's Delicatessen.  Believe the hype!
,,,,,"Oh, the famous Katz. There is so much to love about you."
,,,,,This staple in the LES is a must eat if you are a meat lover.
,,,,,"I've had that reuben (+pastrami) and the macaroni salad. GUYS, the meat is tender, juicy and piled HIGH, but what was such a surprise to me was the macaroni salad. I am constantly craving it now."
,,,,,"If the food wasn't amazing in itself, the theatrics of the whole thing make it a cool place to stop in."
,,,,,"When you walk in you get a ticket for all your ordering needs. The place is jam packed with people (mostly tourists). You choose which meat cutter you wish to order from. Take in the giant restaurant filled to the brim with pictures and memorabilia. Watch the cuter slice your meat, taste a bite and get ready for the pile of meat you just ordered."
,,,,,It is truly unique and gives you a taste of old New York. 
,,,,,"The only thing to gripe about is the price tag. Get ready to shell out at least $20 for one sandwich, but at the end of the day, it's worth it."
,,,,,Katz's is so many things. 
,,,,,A local favorite. A tourist trap. Expensive. Worth every penny. Open early. Open late.
,,,,,"Grab your ticket (don't lose it), go up to the counter, decide what you want while waiting (you want pastrami), and then order (clearly and quickly)."
,,,,,"The sides here are phenomenal. Fries (add your own salt), cole slaw, and pickles are all crowd favorites. The pastrami here is beyond reproach. "
,,,,,"I'd avoid table service to get the full experience and meet new friends! Quarters are close, and this is not a restaurant built for comfort. "
,,,,,Payment is cash only so come prepared or use their ATM with a high fee. 
,,,,,"Do I believe you should be able to skip to the front of the line with a New York license? Absolutely. This place could never be duplicated from a flavor, quality, and history standpoint. You need to experience this once. Go do it."
,,,,,5/5
,,,,,I've never left a review that was not full of content but there is nothing I can say about this place. It's something that everyone in the world must experience once before they die. It's that good. Enough said. Now go buy your ticket  book a hotel  and get your ass down here.
,,,,,"I've heard about this place for years from online reviews and food tv shows so when in NYC recently, I made it a point to check it out."
,,,,,"It's everything that you expect if you've seen photos/watched a show that featured the place. Old school diner-like atmosphere, friendly employees and expensive (but huge!) sandwiches with freshly cut meat. I will agree with what someone else said since I think it accurately describes my feelings as well - ""It's delicious but I wouldn't say life changing."" "
,,,,,"We got there around 3pm and there was no line to get in, however, there were lines behind each ""counter"" inside (there are maybe 8-10 of them?). We didn't have to wait long to order though - the counter line we got in only had two parties in front of us and it moved pretty quickly. We ordered the hot pastrami sandwich ($22) that came with cheese and mustard on it and an assortment of pickles on the side. We also had an onion bagel with cream cheese and tomato ($5). There were two of us and we shared both items - it was a lot of food. We didn't even finish everything! The hot pastrami sandwich was good but typically I like my pastrami cut thinner. I also think the mustard is a necessary addition to the sandwich. It was very dry when I'd get a bite that was just the bread, meat and cheese and I was happy they had more mustard available at the tables."
,,,,,"Overall, we enjoyed the experience and it's fun to dine in and see all the old pictures and feel like you're part of something that's remained pretty unchanged for many years in the city. However......... I will say that I feel this way because we were able to get right in, get some food and enjoy. If I had waited 45 min or more to just get in the door, I don't think I would have been as pleased. I don't think the food is THAT great that it's worth the long wait times. Just my two cents!"
,,,,,Where do I start? Why did it happen to end?
,,,,,I could have spent numerous days here and eat and eat from when they opened up until they closed and back to the hotel for a quick shower and some sleep to be back again when they re open!!
,,,,,Get with the program as I did and learned how the lines work. 
,,,,,"Learned that the Tongue is cold and the Corned Beef is Hot. My slicer was very patient and accommodating. Tipping is not an option, it's a MUST!!"
,,,,,I had one half of Corned Beef on rye and one half of tongue on rye.  
,,,,,Got in the correct line for a side of macaroni salad. It was enough for me!! 
,,,,,Had to do a game changer as the Tongue just didn't sit well on rye so I got up and made a beeline for  the bagel line and ordered a sesame bagel sliced but not toasted. What a difference the bagel made.
,,,,,Accompanying my half sandwiches was the complimentary deli mustard. It was the BOMB of mustards!! 
,,,,,The pickles were crunchy and very fresh. 
,,,,, 
,,,,,I paid with cash so I paid at the front register as the back register is for charge cards?? I'm still learning!!
,,,,,"My "" damage"" due was very reasonable for being in NYC and in a Deli that is known throughout the world for being one of the BEST!!!"
,,,,,"The amount of food exceeded the "" damage"" due!!  "
,,,,,Why did I leave? I guess my original plan was lacking in both time and funds for not only for eating but for lodging??
,,,,,I'll be back regardless and already will be adding the steak fries to what ever I order!!
,,,,,I do not understand why they charge so much for an average sandwich and experience . $24 for a pastrami sandwich with no chips or drinks. Honestly it was ok. The pickles were not marinated well. Disappointed.

,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,"Just to be clear! This review is only on the service or there lack of. The reviews of the food speak for themselves, but costumer service, not so much for me. "
,,,,,"I had order two decent sized gifts one delivered and rave reviews on the first package. My package was due for delivery Friday and showed up on a Wednesday. Not Katz's fault, but when you call 4 times over the course of a week after you received it and still no response. I'm going to have to put that up there with shitty customer service. So, think twice about having food shipped, because if anything happens. You are on your own, yours truly Order #1000110809"
,,,,,"This place is absolutely amazing. I wish I lived nearby this deli place so that I could go there very often. We got a pastrami sandwich and a corned beef sandwich. The corned beef sandwich was a bit too salty, but the pastrami one was amazing. If you are a meat lover, this place is going to be just right for you. They give you really a gigantic amount of deli meat!"
,,,,,We're so glad to hear you've enjoyed your visits here - hope to see you back again soon for another pastrami fix!
,,,,,"Before Katz's, I'd never had a pastrami on rye sandwich. Now I'm sold. Definitely an experience not to be missed when visiting (or living in) NYC!"
,,,,,***
,,,,,Food: 5/5
,,,,,Ambiance: 3/5
,,,,,Service: 3/5
,,,,,Overall: 4/5
,,,,,***
,,,,,The good:
,,,,,- We had the Pastrami on Rye with mustard. It was absolutely divine. I didn't know that a beef sandwich could taste like that!
,,,,,"- We also had the fried potato patties (forgot what they were called) - they tasted pretty good, coming fresh from the fryer."
,,,,,- It's pretty cool how the restaurant is well known in popular culture - a lot of photographs on the walls for you to look at while waiting!
,,,,,***
,,,,,The bad:
,,,,,"- The ordering system is definitely confusing. You should definitely read up online how to order at Katz's before coming here. Basically, you need to hold on to your ticket at all times. Back of the restaurant is reserved for table service (those tables have menus), while the ticket system is for counter service only."
,,,,,"- To order appetizers/sides/drinks/soup, you need to go into a *separate* line from your meat cutter's line - this was something not mentioned to us, which was a little annoying"
,,,,,"- Cash only when checking out at the front of the restaurant; to pay with credit, you'd need to go to the back of the restaurant. This was also not mentioned to us."
,,,,,- The pastrami on rye was over $20 a piece. Now that's a pricey sandwich (but oh so good!)
,,,,,***
,,,,,The verdict:
,,,,,"- I'd definitely come back for another sandwich, now that I know the system!"
,,,,,We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your first visit - hope to you see you back again soon for another pastrami and latke (potato patties) fix!
,,,,,This is quintessential NYC. be prepared to wait!  Suggestions
,,,,,1.  Split a sandwich-they are HUGE (seriously like over a pound of meat on each!) Avg $32/sandwich
,,,,,2.  Seat yourself and order at counter - this takes less time and is part of the experience
,,,,,3.  Drink water - sodas are like $4
,,,,,4.  Don't go during regular mealtimes - line can be around the block
,,,,,5. Enjoy it for the experience!
,,,,,"We're so glad that you enjoyed your meal here! And yes, you're right - the best times to dodge the crowd are the off peak hours: breakfast, between lunch/dinner, or late nights on weekends. Hope to see you back again soon!"
,,,,,This is the most expensive sandwich I have ever purchased in my two and a half decades of existence.
,,,,,"When you enter you can either 1) grab a ticket, place your order with the ""cutter"", and return your marked off ticket to the cashier where you pay upon exiting, or 2) grab a table on the left side for waiter service. "
,,,,,"If you go for option #1, make sure you don't lose your ticket or you'll get charged $50 and try and line-up on the left side starting at #7 as the line tends to be shorter and goes faster. I ordered the Pastrami. Note that the sandwich only comes with rye bread, pastrami, pickles and sauce. Any extras (like lettuce, tomatoes, onions, on club bread, etc.) is going to cost you. I definitely had sticker shock upon seeing this as it's hard enough to justify a $25 price tag for any sort of sandwich anywhere in the US, but seeing the freshly made pastrami made it better. You can literally watch them pull out a HUGE piece of pastrami and watch as they hand carve it into a sandwich. The pastrami was tender and moist, and easily the highlight of the sandwich."
,,,,,"The generous portions of freshly carved pastrami and the cultural history behind Katz brought me in to give it a shot, but the long wait and overall expensive price tag prevent me from being a repeat customer. Katz's has become a tourist trap (probably long before I ever stepped foot inside), and while the pastrami was mouth watering delicious, the $25 price tag for one sandwich makes this place a place you go to check it off your bucket list and that's about it."
,,,,,"Every time I'm in New York, this place is a must! They give you a ticket when you walk in and you have to return the ticket on your way out so make sure you keep the ticket! When I bring first timers here, They love it. I usually get the pastrami on rye. A bit too much mustard but so darn good! Their prices keep going up but it's worth it because they pack on the meat. Their pickles were salty though, I would get the fresh cucumbers next time."
,,,,,"I had the famous pastrami sandwich, a grape drink and chicken soup. Delicious food and great experience."
,,,,,We came because of the hype and reputation but found it to be average.  We were visiting NYC and this was near the top of our list for places to eat.  We walked in and it's not a very friendly or the most inviting place.  I imagine they are inundated with tourists.  There was a man who sort of barked at us to get in a line the very second we walked through the door.  We asked about the tables and he put our name on a list and then herded us to an area to wait for our table.  
,,,,,"We came in for the sandwiches and ordered their classic Hot Pastrami Sandwich and the Turkey sandwich and for a side we got the steak fries.  We didn't have to wait very long before they brought out our meals.  The steak fries looked amazing and tasted just as good.  The sandwiches were stacked with the freshest meats... but that was it.  We were surprised to see dry sandwiches; no mayo, no mustard, no lettuce, tomato, cole slaw or anything atop the sandwiches.  They do have their own Deli Mustard which is unquestionably the best mustard ever to go on a sandwich.  "
,,,,,"I'm sure we could have ordered a side of mayo, some cheese, lettuce, tomato or slaw but our server was hard to flag down which is to say it was impossible.  Other than delivering our food and the check, we never saw our server.  And, unlike the photos you see online and menus, the meat isn't stacked up like the pictures.  The turkey was freshly carved from a roasted turkey.  "
,,,,,"I'm from San Diego and there is a Jewish deli out here (Milton's) that's equally as good (if not better) that Katz.  It was fun to visit such an iconic place, but for the price, I am sure there are other places equally as good in and around NYC and probably not as expensive and better/friendlier service."
,,,,,"We're so sorry to hear that you were frustrated by our service. Though part of our charm for many of our customers is our ""old-school New York"" attitude, we understand that the atmosphere is not for everybody. It wasn't meant to be rude, just schtick - we never want any customer to feel neglected or dismissed. We take quality of service seriously, will take your feedback to heart and address it, and hope that you'll give us the opportunity to give you a more positive experience in future. If you want to speak further with a manager, please feel free to call!"
,,,,,Katz is extremely delicious! The pastrami doesn't even taste like your typical pastrami it's so fresh and seriously falls apart as you eat it.
,,,,,"When you enter, you are given a ticket to enter and must be used to pay as you exit. Even if you share something and don't order anything, you must present your ticket when you exit or you will be charged a lost ticket fee."
,,,,,I ordered a pastrami sandwich and completely finished it because it was so delicious. I don't even like mustard but the mustard on these sandwiches is so good and gives it such a delicious flavor!
,,,,,I'm from California and went to vacation in New York. I'm seriously heart broken with then fact that it will be some time before I'm able to go to this delicious restaurant. Seriously on my list for the 5 best spots I've EVER been to!
,,,,,"I'm originally from Brooklyn, but have been eating at Katz's since my 20's. Not sure if you can eat in the restaurant now which is really a shame because you lose the ambiance. But you can order from there and eat safely with a few friends or family locally or online.  Must orders are: Pastrami on Rye bread with deli mustard, Hot dogs with deli mustard with sour kraut, any type of whole pickles, corned beef sandwich and steak fries. I don't get paid for this just really miss eating at the restaurant. FYI-Harry Met Sally was filmed there, check out the movie, kinda sappy but entertaining."

,,,,,This made our NYC trip complete!
,,,,,"When you walk in they give you a yellow ticket, then you go up and order your food.. coffee was blah but that pastrami sandwich,pickles and cucumber was amazing! My husband and I shared one sandwich and we both we're stuffed..  "
,,,,,Btw don't loose your ticket I think their is a price to pay if you loose it.
,,,,,Worth the hype! I was so so pleased with this sandwich and if it wasn't so expensive I would get it on a regular basis!
,,,,,"Come with a big appetite. Definitely an iconic spot, was a counter only for ordering. "
,,,,,"I ordered the Rueben and my friend had the pastrami. I think the pastrami tasted better to me than the pastrami. The pastrami was leaner meat than the Reuben, which I found too fatty for me. "
,,,,,They stack the sandwiches high and it's enough to feed 2 people per Dagwood. I couldn't finish my whole sandwich and could barely eat half of mine. 
,,,,,We ordered carry out and went to the park.
,,,,,Seriously the best pastrami sandwich I have ever had we do canters in LA and this beats that!!!
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your first visit - and if you're ever craving a cross-country pastrami fix, we offer free two-day shipping on orders over $100! Hope to see you back again next time you're in town."
,,,,,If we talking about pastrami we can't compare Katz to any other deli in NY. The place is amazing. The pickles are delicious. Do yourself a favor and go order a pastrami sandwich.
,,,,,"My fiance and I were staying a friend's house in the neighborhood and figured we had to stop by Katz's Deli since it was just a few blocks away. We walked over the morning after Thanksgiving at around 11:30 am and only had to wait about 5 minutes before going inside. You have the choice to order at the counter or wait for a table. We decided to order at the counter and figured a spot at a table would open up. Since I saw that the sandwiches were pretty big and I always need to have matzo ball soup, I got the half pastrami sandwich and soup. My fiance got the Reuben sandwich which is corned beef, swiss cheese, Russian dressing, and sauerkraut and he added pastrami. We each couldn't even finish our food so we brought it home for a snack after our nap :)"
,,,,,"Although this is definitely a place tourists go to, it's definitely one of the best delis I have been too. I'll definitely be coming back next time I'm in "
,,,,,NY
,,,,,"NYC staple, their pastrami sandwich is the reason people line up here which is AMAZING and stuffed with pastrami but for $25!!!! "
,,,,,A nice treat when you are visiting the city or have a craving for pastrami. They even opened a satellite location in Brooklyn. Comes with free pickles on the side
,,,,,I have been here pleNty of times. We went tonight and were pretty  lucky we were seated right away. But that was all the luCk we had. The waitress we had was horrible. She was in a rush pretty much throwing our plates at us. She seemed annoyed. Until the end. She got friendly. When she said pay the bill up front but leave the tip on the table. And then she added in have a nice holiday. The whole time we were there she totally ignored us. 
,,,,,My review is for the service. Next time we seat our selves! The food was superb!
,,,,,"At this point, Katz is almost like the Statue of Liberty - You really want to visit because it's so famous, but you also know it is packed with tourists. Both are true. If it's a holiday or a weekend, be ready to stand in a very long line, squeeze between tourists and hunt for a table. Is it worth it? Yes, as long as you know what to order. Skip the corned beef - It's incredibly chewy, but the pastrami is divine. All sandwiches are very generous, and not too expensive. I'm a big guy, came hungry, and one of these bad boys was enough. If you still have some room, have the matzo ball soup - We were there when it was raining outside, and even though we didn't take the soup, it looked and smelled amazing. "
,,,,,Pro tip - Rain = No tourists.
,,,,,THE BEST PASTRAMI IN NEW YORK!!! This was absolutely delicious with every single bit! The like was out the door but it was worth the wait let me tell you. They give you a ticket that you can't lose because that's the form of payment you pay when you get out. They write what you ordered on the tickets. The butchers let you try the pastrami before you order it. There are two lines one for the sandwiches and one for sides/drinks. You can pay with cash or card. I will most definitely be coming back here again! ^.^

,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,"Living in California, there are very few proper Jewish delicatessens. On my annual (up until now) pilgrimage to NYC where I was born, I ALWAYS make it a point to have lunch at Katz's, at least once (usually twice), during my trip. I go there both for the food and the experience, both of which are too-notch and can't be found anywhere else."
,,,,,"Like everyone else, I've been getting a bit ""antsy"" during this extended quarantine and I've been longing for a Katz's Deli experience. My solution to this problem was to order Katz's food  delivery to my home."
,,,,,"A couple of weeks ago I ordered what they call ""A taste of New York"" (I believe) which included sliced corned beef and pastrami, rye bread, hot dogs, buns, mustard, sauerkraut, sour pickles and a salami. Mmmmm Good! My father-in-law who has never been to NYC, proclaimed that the food was ""excellent"" and thought that the Katz's mustard in particular, was the best that he's ever had. I just retired after 25 years as a firefighter and I also purchased a larger mail order meal for my brothers and sisters in the firehouse. "
,,,,,"With the success of these purchases still in my mind and my appetite whetted for more, I placed a second order of hot dogs/buns, extra mustard (for dad) and a whole pastrami (which will require further cooking). "
,,,,,"Is the food expensive? Yes! Is the taste and quality of the food exceptional? Yes! Yes! While expensive, free shipping over $100, makes the price more reasonable. UPS 2nd Day Air actually takes 3-4 days, but not to worry as Katz's packages the order in a very gnarly insulated shipping container, with freezer packs."
,,,,,"The food arrived cold/coolboth times, with the freezer"
,,,,,packs still somewhat intact.
,,,,,"I hope to cook the whole pastrami within a week, so I'll be sharpening up my carving knives. Until I can make it back to Katz's Deli in NYC, this food should hold me over. Stay Healthy, Happy and Sane!"
,,,,,"Yes, that hot pastrami is money in the bank."
,,,,,"No, you should never pay $23.95 for a sandwich of anything, anywhere in the world.  Katz's is good, but nothing is THAT good!"
,,,,,"Yes, that hot pastrami is money in the bank."
,,,,,"No, you should never pay $23.95 for a sandwich of anything, anywhere in the world.  Katz's is good, but ain't nothing THAT good!"
,,,,,Must-try! SO much meat!
,,,,,Went here on a surprisingly busy Tuesday afternoon! They give samples at the counter where you order. 
,,,,,"Ordered the Pastrami and Katz's IPA (yes, they have their own beer!). About $25 for the sandwich, but it's packed with meat! Sure wasn't ready! Eat it with the cucumber pickle they serve it with to even out the meat ratio. "
,,,,,Cool environment. Tons of seating. Katz's is a classic 5/5!
,,,,,"Impressive landmark with unimpressive food. I've lived in NYC for 3 years and finally made it to Katz on a Saturday night around 10pm. We were looking for more of a diner, but this was the only thing close enough in LES."
,,,,,"The food is INCREDIBLY overpriced, and I'm not sure why this has become such a tourist destination other than the impressive clientele of celebrities who have frequented it. For context, their pastrami sandwich, which was loaded with meat in their defense, was $24!!! For a sandwich!!!"
,,,,,"We wish we would have known how big they were before ordering one per person. I don't love meat, so I got a grilled cheese, which was actually very good. The pastrami sandwich was flavorful but VERY fatty, so much so that I couldn't eat it. The only thing other than the meat on the sandwich was a very thin layer of mustard. The brisket sandwich was incredibly dry, and again, only had a thin layer of mustard. "
,,,,,"The fries were steak fries and were pretty average. The chili dog was super spicy (beware), and the cheeseburgers looked like McDonald's ones, but didn't taste as good."
,,,,,"When you walk in, you're given a ticket. You then proceed to the counter and order from the butchers. They let you try the meat before ordering which is pretty cool, and a hefty serving of it. After you eat, if you're paying cash, then you proceed to the front door to pay, but if you're card, then you have to go back to the counter. For 6 of us, the bill was about $150, which is ridiculous. We ordered basically one ""entree"" per person and 2 sides of fries. They certainly know how to poach you."
,,,,,I'm rating it 3 because so many like it and their meat is first rate but cmon Katz's get in the 21st century and offer some gluten free things.  At least make a sandwich with gluten free bread.  I know ppl would pay for that.
,,,,,We opted for table service and the waitress was gruff and unfriendly; other staff was pleasant and helpful.
,,,,,All I had was the potato salad and I literally got sick from it.  Lost a whole day of sightseeing in the city.  
,,,,,So Celiacs beware and find some other place for lunch!
,,,,,"We came...we saw....we conquered...the best dang pastrami sandwich known to man!!! Was in NYC for a couple of days, and made sure that Katz was on the list of things to eat. Line was long, but understandable. Wait for a table was quick, as people were coming and going. Pastrami was tasty, large portion of meat, very good. Price was $20 or so dollars just for the sand which, should've at least come with fries, or chips. Anyway....it's done, glad we went, great experience."
,,,,,What a place...I often dream of the pastrami.
,,,,,"Advice: look the menu up in advance if you're a first-timer so as to keep the pace going. I haven't been during quarantine times, but it's a fast-paced environment so be prepared. I had a friend from the south visit and boy was it a culture shock for her. "
,,,,,"Direct, fast service for some of the best food in town. You won't be disappointed."
,,,,,Everyone says you have to go to Katz's. Everyone says it's worth the wait. Everyone says only order half a sandwich because they're huge. Everyone is right!
,,,,,"We stood outside maybe fifteen minutes on a Saturday at lunchtime (hey, we're novices!). When we got inside we got our tickets and I held onto them for dear life thanks to the warnings on yelp about loosing them. I actually witnessed a young girl try to order a cheeseburger and saying she lost her ticket...oof, glad I wasn't her. So we requested table service inside because the whole scene was pretty overwhelming and we didn't even know where to begin ordering from the counters- this would definitely be the way to go if you do feel comfortable though. Instead we waited for about thirty minutes (which was still fine because we were people watching and figuring out what to order), then we were seated at a table for six alongside two strangers. I don't love communal seating but this was ok- these folks just ignored us and we did the same."
,,,,,"My husband and I both ordered egg creams, which were delicious! I thoroughly enjoyed the pickles because I'm a huge pickle fan. I got half of the corned beef Reuben and matzah ball soup. My husband got half of a pastrami sandwich and chicken noodle soup. Everything was fantastic! These folks have perfect recipes and have stuck to them! I definitely couldn't even finish my half after the egg cream, pickles and huge matzah ball!"
,,,,,Now I would be in a rush to go back just because of the whole mob-scene of a crowd. If I lived in New York I might learn non-peak hours and go back. But so glad I experienced once!
,,,,,OMG! Where do I begin. My mouth drools thinking about the pastrami. 
,,,,,I walked in and there were people everywhere. I hadn't a clue what I was meant to do. After 10 minutes I realised I wasn't even standing in line. I was about to leave and though NO... I WANT PASTRAMI! 
,,,,,"Asked someone what going on and he barked ""go over there"". So I did. "
,,,,,For a 26 dollar pastrami reuben sandwich I expect it to be the closest thing to heaven. And it was! Worth every penny! With a gorgeous pickle to go with it. 
,,,,,The problem: it was too big. I choose to leave the bread and eat just the meat. I couldn't eat my second pickle. Why oh why couldn't I eat that pickle. Now I want that pickle! I live in a country where you don't get pickles. sniff sniff. 
,,,,,So Katz deli! Delis like this are disapparing because the younger generation want an egg in a pretty shape and pay 30 dollars for it. All the good delis are disappearing and one day soon maybe this one too. Hopefully not! 
,,,,,years ago I used to be able to walk in any block and find good deli. Now... their all gone! 
,,,,,Eat here before you miss out!
,,,,,Was blown away by the taste of the pastrami! Quite the experience! I really enjoyed it! Glad I knew the portions were large and split a sandwich w a friend.
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,"Katz Deli ~ NY's finest Deli since 1888. It truly is a quintessential experience featuring a totally NY experience- great and over abundant portions of food, particularly the pastrami, loud, simple, direct, a bit frenetic but the real deal kinda joint. Even the pickles are great. Took my brother on our return to NY, our birthplace, and had got the taste he remembered years ago. I got the knockwurst with the deli mustard and that was more than I could eat. Add a Dr. Brown's soda and there's no time to complain- just do it. The lines for food and drink are chaos but if you go with the flow and enjoy the hectic pace of the butchers and choppers as they whip out these  huge plates of food, this only adds to the flavor of the joint. It's a deli and a throwback experience to another era with unfortunately present days prices."
,,,,,We're so glad to hear you've enjoyed your visits here - hope to see you guys back again soon for another knockwurst and pastrami fix!
,,,,,"This is a NYC bucket list destination, and it's also good as hell. When I went there, I was initially overwhelmed with the restaurant system; when you enter, they give you a ticket, and when you leave, you give them back that ticket."
,,,,,"I ordered a pastrami sandwich; they give you slices to sample, and it was perfect. I knew I was going to have an enjoyable gustatory experience. The pastrami was perfectly warm, and the mustard was perfect. It was the best pastrami sandwich I have had in my life! They also sell these craft sodas, and the diet cherry coke doesn't even taste like diet!"
,,,,,"I'm not going to lie, the sandwich is a bit pricey ($21.95!), so it's not a place I will be frequenting OFTEN, but it is a place that I need to go to once every 2 months."
,,,,,We're so glad that you enjoyed your first meal here - we love making new fans! Drop by again soon and give our Reuben a try.
,,,,,"While visiting NYC my friend wanted to go to Katz for pastrami sandwiches. We arrived to see an already busy deli (which just got busier). It's run pretty efficiently so people go through the counters pretty quick. I ordered an egg salad sandwich as I'm not a huge meateater but I ordered 2 more sandwiches to go and told Miguel that I'd be traveling back to SF that day and will need it to be travel friendly. He was on top of it! Separating all the ingredients along with wrapping the meat in foil and adding an ice pack to it. He did everything with a smile and not once was annoyed by having to do so many ""to-gos"" for my group. Miguel really took care of us and was so friendly! It seems as though most of the guys who work here seem to be very friendly as our extensive order gave me a lot of time to spy on others around me. "
,,,,,P.s. the sandwich prices are o.O at $15+ that's high even for me and I live in SF. If I was from a small town from middle america I might have had a heart attack.
,,,,,BEST SANDWICH I EVER PUT IN MY MOUTH!
,,,,,The Pastrami and Reuben (Corned Beef) Sandwiches were absolutely toe-curling orgasmic :O 
,,,,,"This was at the top of my to-do list when I came to NY. Ive seen a lot of documentaries and read lots of articles about this place and have been really excited to try it. You walk in, grab a ticket, and walk up to the ""cutting station"" where a cutter will take your order, take out the fresh cooked meat, have you sample, then cut the meat in front of you. You'll then take your food to the left, grab a drink, then sit down at a table. They will mark your ticket as you order things. "
,,,,,YOU PAY AT THE END SO KEEP YOUR TICKET! 
,,,,,MINIMUM $50 CHARGE IF YOU LOSE IT. YOU CANT GET OUT WITHOUT PAYING AND/OR THE TICKET. 
,,,,,"Enough hype, let's get to the food. "
,,,,,I tried both their Pastrami and Reuben (Corned Beef) sandwiches (came two days in a row). I know this place is famous for the pastrami but the corned beef was just as good. 
,,,,,"The pastrami was to die for though! Such good flavor and cooked perfectly. The Reuben had melted cheese and their special sauce/relish spread. Totally made the sandwich next level! I didn't have sauerkraut because I'm not a big fan, but theirs was actually really good. "
,,,,,Here just look at my pictures. It tasted better than I could take a picture of. 
,,,,,It's been an hour and my toes are still actively curling :O
,,,,,I think I need to go lay on the bed now. Enjoy the pictures
,,,,,I'm a New Yorker and I was raised eating Katz's.  I'm 48 years old and it still tastes the same as when I was a kid.  I just visited this year 2021.
,,,,,"We're so glad that you've enjoyed all your visits here - our long time fans are the soul of our restaurant, and make our jobs so rewarding and fun. Hope to see you back again soon for another pastrami fix!"
,,,,,What can be said that hasn't already?  Great overstuffed sandwiches with melt in your mouth meats. Prices to go with them.
,,,,,What in the world is better than corned beef and hot pastrami with Russian dressing on rye with it piled so high that you tear up?  The answer is nothing. It would be good for goyem to taste real food.  
,,,,,The Chosen People choose Katz's.
,,,,,"This place is an institution on the lower Eastside. Come on off moments to avoid the lines but the pastrami is ridiculously good, I don't eat it with my husband raves about it. I come for the grilled cheese, pickles and all the other delights."
,,,,,"Worst service ever no idea how hard would be to order. The guy at the grill forgot most of my order. Matzah ball soup was not edible, hotdog cold, grilled cheese nothing special and fries were so greasy and overcooked. The only thing good was my husband's pastrami sandwich and the pickles. Took longer to order the food than to eat it."
,,,,,"Cmon bruh, is there such a place That exists in this whole north eastern hemisphere that has better pastrami? I DOUBT IT BIG TIME! My parents been bringing me here since I was a pup and now a father of three, and I still can't get enough of Katz's deli. I can't even think about moving out of New York only because of this place. It's Cut the right thickness and the meat just falls apart in your mouth......Hot Pastrami.....Truly serendipity."
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,"Amazing pastrami!!! You pay for it ($25/ sandwich), but wow is it good! It also easily feeds two, so they makes it more reasonable. Arrived at 830am and, no surprise, no line. People were already seated eating pastrami sandwiches for breakfast. Arrive at lunch and prepare to wait. The meet is so tender and flavorful and the rye very fresh. The place is simple and spacious with loads of cool photos. The staff is very friendly aside from the less than friendly ""bouncer"" kind of guy at the front handing out tickets. Everyone gets a ticket regardless of intent to purchase or with others. Not really sure why. Overall, I'd absolutely stop here again. So goood!"
,,,,,"Really great quality meat!! So juicy and flavorful and they do not skimp on the portion whatsoever. I wish they toasted the bread though - but with how crazy busy they are, I understand why the don't. Note that this place is CASH ONLY and the prices aren't cheap. So be prepared OR just split with your friend because the sandwich is seriously huge and you will fall asleep midway from a food coma. "
,,,,,"Other than the food, the overall process was pretty stressful. Very easy to get trampled by the crowd if you're short and a little hard to figure out what line is what and what's going on. Finding a table after that is also a nightmare. But the meat is worth it!!"
,,,,,Want a solid sandwich with lots of meet then come here.
,,,,,Food: 4.5/5: their sandwiches are well made and they will have me coming back here for lunch again 
,,,,,"Ambience & Service: 3/5: really nothing extraordinary or special, but you don't come to Kat's for amazing ambience or service you come for the food. So this rating is expected to be 3/5 and it should be weighed less. You come to Kats for a good quality lunch/dinner, you don't come to get wined and dined."
,,,,,Loved it!!  The service was great and the Reuben was the best I've ever had by far. Definitely recommend.
,,,,,"We LOVE Katz's Deli, even when we have to wait on line. We sure do wish they would open another location up in Midtown/Theater District to save us all a trip way downtown! There's a giant void uptown since Carnegie shut down. "
,,,,,"We love love love the Pastrami, and often get an extra sandwich on our way to the airport... that's one way to make other passengers jealous on the westbound flight!"
,,,,,"You can make a morning/lunch trip to the Tenement Museum nearby, then Katz's Deli, it's the best in the city now!"
,,,,,"And remember.... Pastrami (or corned beef), RYE Bread, a little mustard.... that's it! That's New York. None of that extra stuff like cheese or whatever."
,,,,,We're so glad that you've enjoyed your experiences here - our long-time fans are the backbone of our restaurant. Hope to see you back again next time you're in the LES!
,,,,,Now I understand the hype. Went there on a Friday night at around 830 pm and lucked out because we were 2nd in line! 
,,,,,"They don't really take the time to explain how the ordering process is, but basically you're given a ticket and you should be sure to keep it and show it everytime you order something and when you're about to pay."
,,,,,The pastrami is out of this world. It's just so fresh and flavorful. The sandwiches are huge and have the price to match it. It can definitely be shared by two people even when hungry.
,,,,,"Some might say it's a tourist trap, but I'd gladly go back!"
,,,,,"I came here at 8am on a weekday and they were still getting ready with all the bread and supplies going through the back, and then going to the front of the line where everyone is waiting to assist."
,,,,,"You get a ticket when you enter and I've been told not to lose it... so I suggest you'd not lose it either haha. I got in line and immediately knew what I was going to get. Pastrami sandwich on rye, with mustard. It also comes with pickles and cucumbers as well. I got it to go but you very well could eat it here - there are plenty of tables here. Oh yeah, they also give you a small plate, a sample kinda, of the pastrami to see if it's to your liking."
,,,,,"For paying, if you are paying by credit card, you'd have to go way in the back because that's the one place that they have to pay by CC. Cash is up front. Here is where keeping that blue ticket pays off and gets you out of here."
,,,,,The pastrami is good. It's not too too too salty and has a lot of flavor - you'll have to taste it to experience it haha. It's made perfectly and was a welcome addition to my stomach at 8:45 in the morning haha. There's layers on layers on layers and just so much meat in there that you'll understand why it is over $20 haha.
,,,,,"Probably would come back if I were in the area, maybe try something else haha"
,,,,,"This is a classic that seems to be frozen in time. The food is outstanding and the portions are huge! I enjoyed a Ruben sandwich, soup, homemade pickles and a coffee. This place has a long, interesting history that is featured on their walls. This is a gem and I'll be back!"
,,,,,Definitely can't come to NY without stopping by Katz's!
,,,,,What did I order:
,,,,,- Rueben [corned beef or you can add pastrami]
,,,,,- Pastrami
,,,,,I highly recommend the pastrami! Can't go wrong with it. 
,,,,,"Do keep in mind, you can do grab and go [like to go style] and then sit in the back area of the restaurant. There is also the option to dine in and have a server take your order for you and you'll be in the main dining area. "
,,,,,"If you choose to order the gran-and-go style, DO NOT, i repeat, DO NOT, lose your ticket that they give you because that is your payment ticket as you leave. You basically eat first then pay as you LEAVE LEAVE."
,,,,,One of my favorite spots in all of New York. The atmosphere is amazing. The pastrami is crazy good. The whole experience is worth it. I Go here every time I'm in the city.
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,"the best sandwich i ever had. if you come to new york, you must get the pastrami sandwich on rye. this sandwich is filled with heaps of meat with a side a pickles and cucumbers. i honestly was taken aback to how big the sandwich was! funny note, i took it to the airport and got stopped by tsa because of it. (ended up talking about how good this sandwich was with the employees there, so if that doesnt convince you idk what will)"
,,,,,"as for getting there, i went around 8PM at night on a sunday and the line wasn't too bad, i probably waited for 10 minutes however i heard that if you go earlier the line gets pretty bad!"
,,,,,"when you first go in you will be given a pink ticket (DO NOT LOSE THIS TICKET), you will need it to leave!!! as you grab your pink ticket, go line up in front of any of the cutting stations and wait for your turn. the cutters don't call numbers or anything it's kind of like you see a line, wait in it. then you order your sandwiches, get them and head towards the back to pay. i believe if you pay in cash you pay near the door you entered from, but if you pay with card you gotta go to the back. after you pay you can opt to sit in and eat there (make sure to let the cutters know) or you can take it to go (which is what i did)."
,,,,,"again, make sure to keep that pink ticket with you and return it to the employee at the door when you leave! "
,,,,,"you absolutely have to try this if you go the new york, happy eating :)"
,,,,,"WOW WHAT AN EXPERIENCE! I first walked up to the restaurant shocked, the line was HUGE! Luckily it moved quite quickly, after all this restaurant has been open since 1888 so they definitely have had time to get things down right. Upon entering you are handed a ticket, DON'T LOSE THIS TICKET! It is your ticket to getting your food and for leaving the building. If you lose it they will charge you $50 when you leave, ouch. Anyways the ordering system is quite unique. Each line is for different things. The first line is for beer and wine, lines 2-7 were for sandwiches and soups, and line 8 was for other drinks and sides. "
,,,,,I opted for the half sandwich half soup combo. I got the pastrami and chicken noodle soup. BOY were BOTH DELICIOUS! I know this restaurant is typically known for the matzo ball soup but after seeing the chicken noodle I couldn't resist. My only complaint would be that I would have liked more broth and less noodles...but i'm pretty sure i'm alone in that feeling so its all good!
,,,,,"The key is to have one person in your party look for a table while the rest of your party orders because tables do fill up quickly! Apparently there was a row of tables that were reserved for table service only. Im not sure how to get on that list but if you're interested maybe call ahead and ask. Overall it is a lovely piece of New York History with great food, a must stop if you're ever in the area!"
,,,,,"It's popular, crowded, loud, and kind of uncomfortable, but it is a must try."
,,,,,"I went on a Saturday afternoon to try to hit off hours. For the record, I've tried to eat here before but Saturday night the wait was insane. It's a little confusing inside. They hand you a ticket that you have to give back on your way out (there's a sign threatening a fine if you lose it but I can't tell if it's a joke or not). You can either order at counter and find a place to sit or you can get waiter service and you can't sit in the wrong place or they'll quickly ask you to move. We were told our 2 person party would be a half hour wait but we were seated in less than 10."
,,,,,"There's a few things on the menu, but the pastrami is a must have. They make it in house and it's like no other meat you've ever had. I got it on rye bread and a sign threatened about asking for mayo (again not sure if this was a joke) but the meat comes out SO hot and juicy and salty and succulent you don't really need any condiments (and I love condiments)."
,,,,,"They also give a complementary bowl of pickles, which is probably great if you like pickles. I also got a side of fries since it seemed like a good idea with the sandwich a) the fries were amazing too b) the sandwich is enormous so only consider if you are sharing. "
,,,,,"I only ate half the sandwich, so big and delightful as it was, then I felt kind of queasy later (it's a LOT of meat on a sandwich) then the next day I had my other half sandwich cold, and it was still pretty good. It's no fresh hot sandwich, but still close."
,,,,,"Some cons: We got in line to exit/pay, waited until we were in the front to tell us it's cash only there and you can use a credit card in the back. Hey that would have been nice to know before waiting in line. There was very little seating if you ordered at counter, so consider that if you are trying to skip the waiter. It's also like a $20 sandwich which the highest priced non-lobster roll sandwiches I've ever eaten. But if you can come on an off hour or take it to go somewhere where it'll still be hot, oh man. It is a must try."
,,,,,"I'm out. I always hated that a buck was necessary to tip the cutter to get a good sandwich. But I dutifully abided. Now it's 5. Baloney , I'm a hostage no more."
,,,,,"Big forewarning that there will be nothing said in this review that the 12,000 other rewiewers haven't said before. However, to sum it all up - THE HYPE IS SO REAL... and it's not even because I came here drunk at 3 am. This place is legitimately heaven on earth. I don't know how I have never been before, but stumbled upon it walking home last night and it was only natural that I walked in & did the damn thing. "
,,,,,"Had a Reuben. 10/10. Probably will go just pastrami sandwich next time without the Reuben sauce (made it a tad messy and hard to eat), but Reuben was still so satisfying. Sour crout and special sauce on top - "
,,,,,. Was mobbed at 3 am and still go food in timely fashion. + they give you like twenty pickles on the side. Mmmmm!
,,,,,"I don't know what else to say here, but I'm in awe. I think I  actually want to go back again today."
,,,,,"I wanted to love this place. We were a party of 14 and we all ordered something different...of course we ordered the pastrami and corned beef sandwiches. We also had cheese steak sandwiches, chicken sandwiches and more. Most of the meat was on the dry side. Our overall rating of the food was average."
,,,,,"The way you order is a bit confusing. Upon entry you get a ticket. When you order your food, you give the server your ticket and they write the price it and return it to you. The same goes for ordering sides and drinks. You pay as you exit. If you lose your ticket, you pay $50...which would have been perfect if we lost ours, cuz after 2 $17 sandwiches, sides and many beers they would have lost money! "
,,,,,Staff was friendly and helpful when asked how to navigate the ordering system. 
,,,,,"The only time I said, ""I'll have what she's having."" is when I was asked if I wanted another beer."
,,,,,Crazy busy place! 
,,,,,This place was a unique deli because you order your food on the side of the restaurant and eat is the left. There is Self serve service and some tables have waiters.
,,,,,The sandwiches ranges from $18-30. A little pricy.
,,,,,The best food there was their Potato Latkas! Super yummy with the Sour Cream!
,,,,,You get a ticket when you walk in and you MUST SHOW YOU'RE TICKET TO LEAVE!
,,,,,Place looks rustic n nice.
,,,,,I have eaten in such places in San Francisco and the atmosphere and food was really nice there!! (Lefty o'Douls)
,,,,,I only tried the Beef Brisket on Rye sandwich and I must say that I was kinda dissapointed...
,,,,,"The lean part was dry like paper and the ""juicy"" part was chewy like rubber. I suspect it was not cooked through to break down the fibres... "
,,,,,Dissapointed and won't be back anytime soon...
,,,,,"Wow. That's the only word I need to describe the sandwich I ordered. The serving size is HUGE, and the pastrami literally fills up your entire stomach. It's both juicy and tender, a sandwich that genuinely changed my perspective on sandwiches. "
,,,,,"The interior was quite charming, having an 80s diner vibe. There were rows of tables free for sitting. The highlight was definitely the sandwich, but we also ordered a soup. It was decent. "
,,,,,"I don't think I would go back for any other casual meal, only because it is not the type of food I would usually get, but it is definitely worth checking out as a landmark of NYC and of Soho."
,,,,,Going here almost seems like a right of passage when you go to New York. It honestly seems like the deli has never aged. 
,,,,,"We came for the pastrami sandwich. The meat was very fresh and hot! They even give you a sample of it while you wait. The sandwich definitely isn't cheap, around $22-23. But it's worth a try if you're in the area."
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,I can't believe Katz is not kosher. Well that's why I gave them four instead of five.
,,,,,"I really enjoy the pastrami Rueben. Their meat is some of the best.  It's thick, juicy, and just yummy. This place is a huge tourist attraction but they are friendly. You'll end up talking to them. Though it's crazy, you'll still find a seat unless your a group of four or more. "
,,,,,"Overall, ol school style, good food & service. Huge draw back though that it's not kosher."
,,,,,A true master piece of sandwiches. We eat at Katz's every time we go to concerts at Arlene's Grocery
,,,,,"Now you've done it.......after 20+ years removed from NY (we are now in northern CA) and thinking the food at our local Jewish Deli (Saul's) was stellar, my daughter had to ruin it and for Christmas Eve ordered one of Katz's To Go Boxes - pastrami, corn beef, latkes, pickles, black and white cookies, and all the fixings........."
,,,,,"As a result, Saul's is now out and Katz is now on my speed dial - we may have to plan a little in advance now, but WELL WORTH IT!!!!"
,,,,,Thank you Katz's!!!
,,,,,Please ignore the hype over this old school deli counter. This popular tourist destination stop is a bit unnerving during the weekends and the appeal can be hampered.
,,,,,"Darn, they do make some great tasting sandwiches in an odd kind of way, so be prepared to stand in line, be prepared, order and taste a sample, and decide quickly because life moves fast in this joint."
,,,,,"Nevermind your comments on how the system works here, it's just old school and that is the way they like to do things. B"
,,,,,"By the way, this isn't a NYC Cheap eat."
,,,,,"Hard to say anything that hasn't already been said. Best pastrami sandwich I've ever had! Every time I visit NYC, Katz's must be on the agenda!"
,,,,,Get a table
,,,,,"This was our first time here and we opted for getting a table, the lines for the carvers were very long. With a party of four and on a Sunday afternoon, it only took us about 15 minutes to be seated. "
,,,,,The service was reasonably quick (for NYC) and the food was delicious.
,,,,,"Pastrami with cheese was huge, enough for two people. Pastrami was flavorful and so tender. Matzo Ball soup was hearty and really hits the spot. Potato latkes (3 per order) hot and fried to perfection. Wash it all down with a Dr. Browns soda and you are set."
,,,,,"Its a bit pricey ($20+ per person) but for the amount of food and it being a classic NY establishment, it's not bad. Overall very happy with our lunch here and will definitely return again."
,,,,,*Hang on to your ticket*
,,,,,Iconic and delicious. We arrived at brunch time on Saturday morning and there was not a line. This is a must do destination.
,,,,,Katz's is a staple on many different TV networks so again - we had to check it out. Much bigger then I thought it would be and still has that old school charm. 
,,,,,We ordered the classic pastrami on rye with mustard. We also ended up with two yuengling beers and found that it was one of the few locations in New York City where we could find Yuengling. We found the pastrami was really a perfectly done sandwich and it tasted amazing with the Rye bread. The pickles were really good and it was easy to tell it was a recipe that has been crafted over the years.
,,,,,We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your first meal here - there's nothing we love more than making new fans. Swing by again soon and give our Reuben a try!
,,,,,Pastrami. Gold Standard.
,,,,,Katz's is the real deal. 
,,,,,Don't lose that ticket.
,,,,,Excuse me? Super freakin moist and juicy pastrami?! Didn't even think that existed. And wouldn't even be able to imagine how that would taste...Until cutter #4 handed me a small plate and sample of the best pastrami I've ever tasted. And I don't even like pastrami! But of course I had to try this place and see if the hype was real. And it is so real. No joke. 
,,,,,"I'm no pastrami fan and definitely not a rye fan. But I had to come here and try the pastrami. It was juicier than a good tender expensive piece of steak. It was like butter. And it truly does melt in your mouth. I couldn't do the rye though. I really just do not like rye bread so I opted for the Italian bread and combined with the pastrami, it was a really really good sandwich. "
,,,,,"If you've haven't been, then go. If you're thinking about it, just go. If you hate pastrami, just still go. Any restaurant that could take my dislike of a food and turn my opinion into a 5 star review...now that is a restaurant that is doing things (and cooking things) exactly right."

,,,,,"I'm from Southern California and always wanted to make it to Katz's.... Made it!  Ok, so I'm a tourist/foodie, but you've got try this landmark!  Ordered a Reuben to go and really enjoyed it!  So many amazing deli's in NYC!  Why not try this first and judge from there!"
,,,,,Update... still so damn good!

,,,,,"Great spot for a quick bite. Delicious sandwich. Did not want to share it, but I had to. lol"
,,,,,Had a great time at Katz last Saturday afternoon! The line was long but moved quickly (about a 20 minutes wait at 3pm on a Saturday). Once inside you have the choice to order at the counter and seat yourself or wait another ~15 minutes for table service which is what I did. 
,,,,,If you come to Kats you definitely need to get one of their staple sandwiches (Pastrami or the Ruben). They are each about $20 and LOADED with meat so make sure you come here with an appetite! Their sides are great too and come with plenty to share. While all of the food was delicious - it was pretty plain and simple at the same time. 
,,,,,It is definitely a tourist attraction but I had to come here at least once now that I live in NYC and I was not disappointed. The only weird/confusing thing is how they give every single person a ticket on the way in and you have to give it back on the way out whether you were the payer or not. They had different lines if you already paid or not and if you are paying with a credit card or cash. If you lose your ticket you get charged extra (even if someone in your party already paid). Still not sure how that part works but moral of the story is DON'T LOSE YOUR TICKET!
,,,,,"The pastrami sandwich was excellent, but I fell in love with the turkey sandwich and house beer! Would highly recommend if you can wait in line for a few minutes and don't mind a crowded space."
,,,,,"I came here because it is an iconic restaurant, and while the sandwich was pretty good, I have to admit I wasn't the biggest fan. There is a LOT of meat (which if you love, then I'm sure you'd enjoy this sandwich), but I just personally didn't find it worth the price. It is pretty expensive for a sandwich that is predominately meat. I found it a bit salty overall and felt like I needed a balance of some veggies or something, but that's just me. I definitely think you should stop by and try a sandwich because it is quite an iconic place and by no means is the food bad- just not my type."
,,,,,"Despite how famous Katz's Delicatessen is, I really am not a fan of their  famous pastrami sandwich with their homemade mustard on rye bread. I tried to like it, but it was not that delicious to me. The sandwich was abundant so sharing between two people is ideal. The pastrami meat was very savory and juicy, however, I thought it was very oily too. After eating the pastrami sandwich, I had a guilty feeling that I just cut off a few years of my life by eating this."
,,,,,I also do not like their ordering system and that it can be a bit annoyance if you accidentally lost your ticket.
,,,,,"So we used to like to visit the Carnegie Deli when in New York, but after that closed someone told us about Katz's, and it did not disappoint."
,,,,,Here is what we noticed:
,,,,,"- We arrived around 10:30am and were handed a ticket...it wasn't very clear how things worked, but we wanted a sit-down lunch and so we were directed to one of the tables along the wall.  Just be sure to bring back all of the tickets you receive to the register when leaving, or apparently you get charged for lost tickets."
,,,,,"- Service was ok...it took our waiter a little bit of time to show up and he was a little crusty as first, but he warmed up over time.  (Note, he made it clear that we should leave the tip in cash on the table versus putting it in the jar up front)."
,,,,,"- The foot was great.  Coffee was better than expected.  We got one pastrami sandwich and the bagel and lox platter.  They were out of sesame seed bagels, but the poppy seed one was pretty good."
,,,,,"Bottom line:  Worth a visit, but try to go at a time where you can avoid the crowds!"
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your first visit! If you want to dodge the crowds next time, try dropping by at an off-peak hour: breakfast, between lunch/dinner or late nights on weekends. Hope to see you back again soon."
,,,,,"The hype is real and it's delicious! So we had to wait in line on a Friday around 6pm for about 30-35 minutes. So in that time I found us a table to sit at while my husband waited in line. Right when you walk in they hand you a ticket, HOLD ONTO THIS TICKET!! Put it in your wallet or where you can find it later. You'll need this ticket to exit the restaurant. There was a couple in front of us, Definitely visiting from Europe, so they had very little English in their vocabulary and they were fumbling for the ticket because they couldn't find it. They ended up having to pay some sort of fine. The ticket is their way of knowing what you bought! It helps the lines go faster. Anyways let's get back to the food. So once we sat down we both shared A pastrami sandwich. It was definitely good for two people. Unless you're super hungry. It had tons of flavor, it was super juicy, and it's definitely worth the wait. The matzo soup was my favorite! Definitely brought me back to a Jewish friends kitchen. The pickles were also a great salty touch! There's free water in the back, so make sure you grab that as well before eating! And it's NY water system, the best tap water! "
,,,,,But one star short because it's WAY too expensive for one sandwich. ‍
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your first visit - we love making new fans! If you want to try dodging the crowds next visit, drop by at an off-peak hour: breakfast, between lunch/dinner or late nights on weekends. Hope to see you back again next time you're in town!"
,,,,,The pastrami Reuben is to die for; pastrami made perfectly. The turkey was a bit dry but taste was good.
,,,,,Close to $25 for a sandwich
,,,,,Really delicious though
,,,,,The sandwich is FATT. 
,,,,,Smokey and juicy but not overly salty
,,,,,Shared one pastrami sammie and fell into a food coma
,,,,,So heavy but so good
,,,,,Had to wait 30 min in line to order
,,,,,"They take card in the back, cash in the front"
,,,,,Everyone gets a ticket when you walk in

,,,,,"When in NYC, you have to expect this, you bleed money!  "
,,,,,"Katz's famous pastrami sandwich.  The pastrami is flavored with flavors, the meat is tender enough to eat with just the gums in your mouth, the meat is stacked 5"" high, and the bread holds the meat in well.  All this will set you back by $21+.  Take my first born, will ya!"
,,,,,"Famous deli of NYC where ""When Harry met Sally"" was filmed with Sally demonstrating a fake orgasm in front of Harry.  Classic movie!  I can watch that over and over again and the story is still relevant to this very day."
,,,,,"They have a strange way of allowing patrons buy their food.  You must obtain a ticket to order.  If you lose it, they charge $50.  Lame.  The system needs to be updated and revamped with newer technology.  Don't care if it's traditional... get with the times."
,,,,,"Great place to sink your pearly whites into their food.  Must go, even if you bleed money out the door."
,,,,,"They definitely live up to the hype. I'm a new New Yorker n this place was on my radar. I have been trying to get here all year. Today I decided to just jump on the train n go. When I arrived there was no line, I was surprised. They take your temperature when you come in and if you want to dine in you have to sign in first. I got the traditional pastrami. The sample they give you while carving your sandwich just melts in your mouth. I'm not a big meat eater, today was an exception.... totally worth it. Yes it is a little pricey but you are in NYC where everything is expensive.  I would rather pay $30 for a great sandwich than $5 for a crappy one. I ordered the fries, I think they were $7.50?? anyway, I would not order them again, you don't need them. Honestly your sandwich is more than enough. I only ate half of half n was stuffed. It's all that meat they put in it. A long line did form while I was there. Anyway, I will definitely return even if I have to wait next time... totally worth it. I'm looking forward to the brisket"
,,,,,"I dont eat pastrami, but when I do... it's at KATZ!!! Hands down, the best pastrami on earth. It's so juicy and tender, full of flavor, gigantic portions. Ordering may be a little confusing for first-timers, but it's well worth it, I promise you. I cant wait to go back to NY!! Katz I'm coming for you!! Soooooo fudgin delicious!!!!!!"
,,,,,"Probably the best pastrami I've ever had. Super moist and flavorful. Really melts in your mouth. I could see why this place has been such a staple in NYC. I got the half pastrami sandwich and cup of chicken noodle soup. Cost around $18-19, which is a little pricey but the portions were pretty generous. Free pickles with every order was a nice touch too.  Overall a good place to grab a quick bite of your favorite deli meats."
,,,,,"Even during COVID they still give you your little sample while you wait and the food just never disappoints they be open for all these years and hopefully many more, I love you guys  a real NY OG Spot"
,,,,,"Everybody says that a trip to NY is not completed without a sandwich from Katz's. I dropped by the place in the morning of my last day. The place was lightly populated. There were many cutter stations, sandwiches in the front and bagels at the back, so I doubt there can be a long wait even during a busy time. "
,,,,,"Of course, I opted for the Pastrami Sandwich. Haven't had many Pastrami Sandwich, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. The ones that I've had were dry and hard to swallow. With the stacks of meat that were piled between the thin slices of bread and mustard, I expected Katz's Pastrami Sandwich to be the same. "
,,,,,"But, I couldn't be more wrong. The moment I tried to pick up the humongous sandwich, everything started to fall apart; everything was surprisingly soft. Even the bread was softer than I expected. Each slice of pastrami was accompanied with a good amount of fat that made the whole pile melt-in-the-mouth tender. Although the sandwich was big, it was easy to get a mouthful of everything. The pastrami tasted fresh, succulent, and not salty at all. Katz's Pastrami Sandwich gave me a Pastrami experience that I've never had before."
,,,,,"The fresh and pickled cucumbers cut the meaty, fatty sandwich well. I also enjoyed ketchup on the sandwich. Despite its high quality, the sandwich was still a litte too pricey, in my opinion."
,,,,,"By the end, I was completely and happily stuffed with one sandwich; I would recommend splitting between 2. I can concur that this is a must-visit classics spot for visitors of NYC."
,,,,,We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your experience - there's nothing we love more than making new fans. Hope to see you back again for a pastrami fix next time you're in town!
,,,,,"The lore and history behind Katz's is legendary. I mean come on, it had the climatic moment in When Harry met Sally, and photos of the who's who, spanning many generations, is splattered over every wall. So with history out of the way, let's get to the eats. Their Pastrami sandwich is juicy, not too salty, and smoky smooth. Cut thick and nestled between two moist pieces of rye, this is an experience to remember. It's a bit pricey at nearly $22 for the Pastrami sandwich but you're also partially paying for the experience. "
,,,,,"Their ticketing system is another thing though, everyone and I repeat every single human body, must have a ticket to not just order but to exit the premises. You don't pay until you're done with your meal and are about to exit. "
,,,,,"With all of its quirks, I still would recommend you give this a shot at least one time. It should be on your checklist when visiting the Big Apple."
,,,,,It's hard to review NYC institutions. I feel like people like me commenting on on a place they lived through the 1970s is the definition of entitlement. Katz's is more than a deli--it's a piece of NYC culture and hopefully it lives on forever in its original way. Eat here.
,,,,,This was my friend's first time and my second time at Katz's Deli.  Definitely a reason to cheat on your diet!!!!
,,,,,"One a the best meals we had while visiting New York! Usually lines out the door we arrived right around 1130 am and only waited about ten minutes too be seated. They are very good with service and quick to move the line for both takeout and dining in. Recommended by a local bar tender in little Italy the night before he said for the full experience to get the pastrami sandwich, with potato pancakes and a dr browns black cherry soda, so we did. The pastrami was fresh and hot and tender. I recommending splitting it as everything is very generously portioned and piled high."
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,Brought the Brisket. The sandwich is really tasty but it is also really overpriced. Expecially when Juniors is the next street over and they also have delicious brisket for a fraction of the cost as well as Davids Brisket on Nostrand Avenue where you can get a very tasty brisket for half the cost.
,,,,,"Got a to go pastrami sandwich..The meat was so delicious, very juicy and tender. There were a lot of meat in the sandwich and I got full after eating half sandwich. Highly recommend it"
,,,,,AMAZING!!! Hands down the BEST pastrami Sandwich. You're able to pick between the pastrami or the corn beef but I definitely prefer pastrami. You can also ask them if you're able to try a bite of both and then you're able to determine which one is the best you! ($17)
,,,,,One of the best Pastrami I have had.
,,,,,Nice outdoor seating on the sidewalk.
,,,,,They have a nice ordering system with the Covid.
,,,,,"This place is nothing to look from the outside.  Don't let that fool you.  Yep, nothing to look on the inside either.  But I have traveled from Borough to Borough to get to that incredible Pastrami sandwich.  The juiciest sandwich ever."
,,,,,Definitely worth the hype. 
,,,,,The pastrami sandwich is really good. It's clear why this place is famous. Definitely worth a visit at least once.
,,,,,"Am I missing something here?  I don't understand why this place gets so much praise. Yes, it's been around a very long time and yes, it has been frequented by celebrities and very important people from around the world but other than that, I just don't get it."
,,,,,"The food was not what I expected it to be.  Let's start from the beginning.  I arrived at Katz's around lunch time.  The line was out the door but moved fairly fast.  Once inside you are given a ticket and fall in to one of many lines.  The place is pretty big and busy...very busy.  After ordering or eating in, you pay at the register prior to exiting, so make sure to hold on to your ticket!"
,,,,,"I ordered the mixed Corned Beef and Pastrami sandwich with cheese.  It comes on rye with sauerkraut and some sauce.  Prior to ordering they give you a taste test of the meats. The meat is actually not bad, but put together in a sandwich with all the other ingredients....not so great.  My advice is to skip this place.  Save your $25 bucks and spend it elsewhere.  Yes, my sandwich costed $25, no sides other than the pickle spears they provide.  Not worth it."
,,,,,"You have to visit at least once or twice if you're new to NY - it's an experience worth having. Legendary spot, friendly staff, pricey but the food is great and I mean... it's New York. "
,,,,,Tips for your visit: 
,,,,,"The earlier in the day, the better. Around lunch, expect a crowd. Evening hours, expect to wait (think school cafeteria) "
,,,,,"DO NOT LOSE YOUR TICKET - whether you're passing through or dining in, you're given a ticket as soon as you enter. You need that ticket for your order and it also serves as your exit pass. Lost tickets incur a fee upwards $50 (not even kidding, there's a sign on the podium). "
,,,,,Food Recommendations: 
,,,,,"- Lox and cream cheese on bagel (everything bagel if you're serious, plain if you're shy) "
,,,,,- Knoblewurst + Rye bread 
,,,,,Iconic spot - bring a friend and enjoy a hot meal
,,,,,"We came per my brother's recommendation. The place is jam packed and there's weird dust on the floor, perhaps to soak up the rain? Either way, I dropped my umbrella and there was no saving it from hundreds of particles coating it, but moving on."
,,,,,"You can either wait to be seated after signing in with the host or you can order from the counter. We opted to be served. My bf and I along with another couple were called and ended up being squished at the same table. We unfortunately were seated inside next to the wall, and between other tables, we couldn't comfortably dine, let alone budge in fear of hitting the person behind you. It's just a strange experience to have to dine with a couple you don't know. Service, I feel, is your typical New Yorker service. Brief, straightfaced, but they're busy, so that's understandable, but they also basically throw items down onto the table."
,,,,,"Loved the matzo meatball soup and the cheesesteak. I'm not a huge fan of pastrami sandwiches, so I can't rave about that. Portions are pretty hefty, so if you don't eat large sandwiches normally, order one to share."
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your meal, but sorry you were somewhat disappointed by our service - we never want any customer to feel less than thrilled by their experience. Though part of our charm for many of our customers is our ""old-school New York"" attitude, we understand that the atmosphere is not for everybody. It wasn't meant to be rude, just schtick - but we would love to have you come in and experience the food without the attitude. Hope to see you back again soon for another matzoh ball fix!"
,,,,,"I love this place, it's been a special part of my life for years and years. Always pick the slicer with the shortest line, tip them well, and ask for what you want - lean, fatty, ends, whatever you want! Don't miss a square knish and pickles. It's the comfort food of the gods!"

,,,,,I've lived in NYC for most of my life and Katz's Deli is a constantly recurring name. I finally decided to see whether it is worth the hype and I can say that it lives up to its hype. 
,,,,,"I don't think I've ever seen a sandwich place so filled with people. Walking in, I was told to join a line. There are no clear indicators as to which line is where, so you really need to make sure you're actually on a line before waiting. I saw other people ordering samples so I tried the pastrami and corned beef and honestly, I don't think I've ever had pastrami so good in my life; I don't even know if I've had beef brisket that was so well-seasoned and so tender in my life. The pastrami was so unbelievably juicy. (The corned beef was good, but nowhere near as awesome as the pastrami.) "
,,,,,"I ended up ordering a pastrami sandwich and matzo ball soup. Mustard is definitely the condiment of choice - it adds a wonderful tang that really works well with the juicy, fatty pastrami. The pastrami is definitely the star of the sandwich, and it feels like the rye bread and mustard that go with it are simply there to help you consume copious amounts of pastrami. The matzo ball soup was good; very homely and reminiscent of chicken noodle soup, but the pastrami sandwich was certainly the star of the show. "
,,,,,"Even though it's so crowded, I think the sandwich is well worth the wait, and it certainly lives up to all the hype around it."
,,,,,Basically the best pastrami. Ever. 
,,,,,I was visiting the city back in September and I still dream about the damn sandwich. 
,,,,,"Yes, the lines are pretty long, but they seem to have a decent system going. It's definitely an experience in itself just being in that line. (Enjoy that sample pastrami slice they push your way, even though we all know that it's the greatest based solely off the smell, the look of other people's stacked sandwich, the look of other customers enjoying said sandwich, and the line of people waiting to get their own pastrami!)"
,,,,,"Don't be deceived by the packed dining room--tables aren't that hard to find as people clear out quickly. (Well, at least during the 1pm Saturday that I visited. Might be a fluke.) But if you decide to grab it to go, you can find a bench right at the crosswalk or around the area."
,,,,,"If you're in NYC, go here. If you're not in NYC, make plans to go here."
,,,,,"What happened? The pastrami here was melt in the mouth amazing, and then a year or so ago I noticed a change. The meat was stringy and kind of "
,,,,,gross. Went back last week and it was the same thing. Was I making up the brilliance of Katz's in my mind all those years? How did it get so bad? Really disappointed.
,,,,,"I would give it five stars for the quality. The food was amazing. I had to ding it one star due to the price. Very expensive. However, now that I have gone, I would probably share a sandwich.  Portions are very large. Once again an amazing sandwich"
,,,,,Best Pastrami in nyc. For that you want to go there.
,,,,,Other sandwiches are good but... pastrami is the speciality. Pickles are amazing.
,,,,,"I don't know what can't be said about Katz that hasn't been said before, other than it reminds my little Bay Area self of Tommy's Joynt in SF."
,,,,,"Katz's Delicatessen serves incredibly fresh and savory meat, does take credit cards, and I did love the corned beef, even though I got roasted at work for not getting the pastrami."
,,,,,"It's a bit of a crush to get a seat, and overall the experience is a bit more anxiety ridden than I would have liked but the food is sooo sooo delicious."
,,,,,"It makes the busy too and fro totally worth it, 100%."
,,,,,"We're so glad you enjoyed your first visit - we love making new fans. If you want to try dodging the crowds next time, drop by at an off-peak hour: breakfast, between lunch/dinner or late nights on weekends. Hope to see you back again to give our pastrami a whirl!"
,,,,,"Katz's is exactly what it promises, a big New York City, 50s-style, Jewish deli with amazing sandwiches--although, it's way older than the 1950s."
,,,,,"This is probably the best Reuben sandwich I've ever had. Seriously, the pastrami is Jewish, New York City barbecue in the best way possible. It's warm, moist, salty, fatty amazing beef served in a no-frills environment just like the Texas barbecue that got me really into good beef."
,,,,,"Honestly, the meat is so good, I could probably have done without the sandwich around it and might when I come back. I won't go into the details about how the restaurant works since so many others have, but do expect some samples of meat while your sandwich is being made and enjoy them. We had the corned beef and it was spectacular although not as good as the pastrami."
,,,,,"The rest of the sandwich was good: nice bread, good dressing, nice kraut, but beyond the meat, the pickles were my next favorite part. Some were very lightly picked and just slightly tangy, salty cucumbers, while others others were almost textureless and super pickled."
,,,,,We're so glad that you enjoyed your first visit - drop by again soon for another Reuben fix!
,,,,,"Kat'z has the best pastrami we've ever had, and they've made the preparation part of the show of serving it. We truly enjoyed it, but only gave it 4 stars cause at +$22 is overpriced even for NYC. We shared one, so felt priced was ok if sharing."
,,,,,Fuck yeah fuck yeah fuck yeah. I've grown up on their pastrami on rye with mustard since I was a little girl my father would bring it home from us after work in the city. 
,,,,,BUT THE KICKER that *newbies and tourists always miss* is to ask for their pickled green tomatoes!!!
,,,,,Katz Sandwiches usually come with sour and dill pickles but you have to ask for the pickled green tomato. Gives that perfect acid which pairs so nicely with the fatty succulent buttery peppery pastrami. 
,,,,,So sad that I moved. I used to live 4 blocks away from Katz's. Nothin like the smell of pickles and meat on my walk to the subway at 7:00am. 
,,,,,The son runs it now or something cool. He's a hottie. And he's bringing this place into the new age so it's really wonderful to see Katz's integrating with other restaurants and showing up at pop-ups.
,,,,,Katzs deli is one of the best and authentic places where you can eat an amazing sandvich . Its a little bit pricey but it worth the every single penny. Trying to get there as much as I can . Highly recommended.

,,,,,"Most importantly, the pastrami was amazing. Very moist and perfect fat ratio. I put the pickles they give on the side into the sandwich and the acidity matches the fat perfectly. "

Since I'm not traveling these days, I've been having my favorite foods shipped to me. Katz does its only delivery service and they are shipping all over the country for free with a minimum purchase. They also have a monthly subscription offer if you need a monthly fix. I got all of my favorite deli things - matzo ball soup,  pastrami, knishes, latkes, everything bagels, and lox. Yum, yum! It arrived and was so delicious, almost as being there in NYC. The best part is you can freeze or refrigerate so you can enjoy it over multiple days. Everything came well packaged, was extremely fresh tasting and now I can have a bit of real NYC in FL."
,,,,,Heaven is a sandwich!
,,,,,"A longtime lover of Carnegie Deli (RIP Carnegie), I had to try the famous Katz's. When you walk in, the overpowering and incredible aroma of pastrami hits you over the head. I queued up in line and began to place my order for the most amazing Turkey sandwich of my life. Juicy, flavorful, and loaded in between two pieces of rye bread, this sandwich did not disappoint. Believe the hype, Katz's sandwiches are biting into a piece of perfection and bliss."
,,,,,We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your first meal here - there's nothing we love more than making new fans. Drop by again soon and give our pastrami Reuben a whirl!
,,,,,Pastrami is dry and expensive. Please
,,,,,Tell me who said this was the best in town? Don't waste your money.
,,,,,Some of the pros of Katz's deli:
,,,,,- Their pastrami is great
,,,,,"- Service is generally good, it's almost an experience to get food there. Also you can taste different meats"
,,,,,- very filling and big sandwiches
,,,,,"My only complaint is that ever since covid, their quality clearly took a hit. I remember going before covid and their pastrami was the 'best I've had'. During covid, it was more just good pastrami."
,,,,,Amazing pastrami sandwiches. One of the best sandwiches I've ever had and it's a good price. Definitely recommend if you're in New York.
,,,,,"Okay, you can go ahead and say it, everyone likes Katz's so giving it a bad review is pretty much sacrilege.  I like to think of myself as someone who, while I get very excited about trying popular places, I try not to let popularity cloud my opinion of the actual food.  Katz's was an especially hard case of this, as Jewish delis serve some of my favorite food on Earth, and this is arguably the most popular Jewish deli on Earth.  "
,,,,,"With all of that said, Katz's lived up to all of my expectations and then some."
,,,,,"We waited in the LONG line for about 30-40 minutes before getting inside and handed two tickets.  For those of you who have never been, the guys making the sandwiches write your orders on these tickets, and the tickets are presented to the cashier to pay.  Losing one of these tickets results in a $50 penalty (each member of the party receives a ticket, whether or not they use it)."
,,,,,"We waited another 20-25 minutes at the counter to order our sandwich.  At this point, the wait was getting to us and we were very hungry.  We went for a pastrami reuben on rye, with fries and two drinks.  This order ran us upwards of $40, which for one sandwich, fries and two drinks is obviously incredibly expensive, but it's Katz's so fair enough."
,,,,,"The sandwich was absolutely delicious.  The pastrami is nice, thick slices, the sauerkraut is delicious, the rye is very fresh and the fries are piping hot and perfectly washed down with Dr. Brown's root beer.  The pickles and cucumbers served on the side of each sandwich are absolutely delicious and perfectly compliment the meal."
,,,,,"The meal was delicious, fully living up to my expectations which were outrageously high to begin with.  But, on top of the meal, the experience was everything I wanted out of the most famous deli in NYC, and overall was everything I wanted it to be."
,,,,,"Katz's Delicatessen has the best deli sandwiches! The two times I went to New York, I made sure we came here. Before anything else, make sure you have CASH! They don't accept credit cards, so be sure to run to the bank and get cash."
,,,,,"The first time I came with my fiance was a few years back and we came early in the day and didn't have to stand in a long line, but the second time around just this past May with my fiance and my mom, we had to wait about 20 minutes and then another 10 min inside to order."
,,,,,Here's some tips to order like a regular at Katz's Deli!
,,,,,"First, once you walk in, each person in your group will get a ticket. Please remember to return all tickets (used or used) at the register because I believe if you don't there will be some type of fee."
,,,,,"Next, you get two options for seating. Option 1 is that you wait for a table and a staff takes your order. Keep in mind, all front tables along the front wall are reserved for waiter service only. Option 2 is you go to the counter, order your food, then find any open seat."
,,,,,"After you decide the seating, then it's time to order at the stations. There are different stations, so just make sure to read the signs hanging overhead. The first few stations is where you can order burgers, hot dogs, cheesesteaks, and soups. The middle stations is where you can order all the sandwiches from hand-sliced pastrami, corned beef, brisket to turkey. Lastly, at the register is where you'll order the sides and drinks. Make sure to know what you'd like to order before your turn in line."
,,,,,"Finally, after you're all done with your food, simply leave your tray and plates, and go to the register and pay."
,,,,,Important things to note: Order the pastrami sandwich. It's so good with the pickles. Best thing ever! You could share but I didn't since I love the idea of having leftovers and eating the rest for later.
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear you've enjoyed your visits here - and though cash is the easiest way to check out, we can also accept credit cards at the back of the store near the water station. Hope to see you back again soon for another pastrami fix!"
,,,,,Incredible food and great people! I always enjoy my meal and full experience. A New York classic and absolutely must go.
,,,,,"We came around Saturday at 12pm and the line was fairly short. They have 7 different stations and I'd recommend going to the one furthest from the entrance, which probably has the shortest line."
,,,,,"They allow samples. I tried the roast beef, corned beef, and pastrami. Personal favorite was the pastrami cause it had the most flavor and on the saltier side. Paired with the sauerkraut and swiss cheese, it tasted heavenly. Pastrami was soft and juicy, and the sauerkraut neutralized the saltiness. It is absolutely massive though so I'd highly recommend splitting an order or you'll probably have leftovers."
,,,,,"Heard about this place for a long time now, but it definitely lives up to the hype!"
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,"After passing it up countless times because of the lines and feeling like it's a tourist trap, finally got to try it. My cousin, who was visiting from out of town, wanted some ""classic nyc food"" and Katz seems to come up on every nyc must-try list. We went around lunch time on a rainy Saturday and fortunately the notorious line was not present. With that being said, the busy-ness that ensued once we opened the door never subsided. "
,,,,,Not really a fan of the whole ticket system that they have since I always lose things. 
,,,,,"The deli counter moves pretty efficiently with multiple stations handling orders. I went with the pastrami sandwich and my cousin ordered one of the other sandwiches which I can't remember because it didn't taste that great. The pastrami, on the other hand, was the real deal. Thick, juicy, flavorful pieces of freshly cut pastrami lathered with mustard on rye is a pretty solid sandwich to me. I appreciated the cucumbers and pickles given on the side. I also appreciate that sample of pastrami they give while they're finishing up your order."
,,,,,"Yeah, the sandwich is pricy, but I'd say the pastrami is worth it if you're looking for some standard nyc food and don't mind waiting in a line. "
,,,,,They also have water and bathrooms on hand which is nice since it's always a struggle to find decent ones in the city.
,,,,,"The pastrami is unreal, it's been a neighborhood spot for me for years and while sometimes mentally maybe it seems a little expensive for a sandwich, they are massive and trust me it's completely worth it. It's quality and incredible taste, you can't go wrong."
,,,,,This place never disappoints! The food came out piping hot and the flavor is off the charts.
,,,,,Ummm... I feel like I'm in la-la land. The food was... kinda tasteless. Kinda bland. Kinda flavorless. Kinda not worth all the talk. Kinda wondering what's going on with Yelp. Kinda think this is one of those places that became a thing and everyone pyschs themselves into thinking it is amazing. 
,,,,,Anyways. Service wasnt that great. Server had an edge... who woulda thunk it... a NYer with an edge lol.
,,,,,"Anywho they have the STUPIDEST ticket rule. They are killing trees to hand out ticket number. Your ticket gets written on when you pay for food. If you do t get any food, you must return the ticket. Lost tix are $50. "
,,,,,"So you order the food, someone writes on the ticket then you take your ticket to pay for the food. "
,,,,,"Why on Earth dont you order your food, pay for it and wait like other places? I have not idea. Crowd control I suppose and that just means they need to reconfigure the ordering process..."
,,,,,"Versailles. The Vatican. The Grand Canyon. Katz's Delicatessen. It is the quintessence of an entire culture now all but gone. It is a deli. It is ""The"" deli. The sandwiches are enormous, bursting with flavor. The brisket is spiced and slow cooked to perfection. The Ryebread is fresh and the mustard is slathered by a practiced hand. This is Katz's. Crowded. Long wait. Corned beef, pastrami, chopped liver, pickles and coleslaw. We wait. We anticipate. We order. We watch a craftsman carve.  We find a table eventually. And then we eat. Oh my, do we eat. Pricey? Yes. Worth it? Oh yes."
,,,,,No trip to New York is complete unless you head to one of the famous iconic food places and perhaps one of the most famous foodie joints is Katz's Deli near lower Manhattan.  
,,,,,The hundreds and perhaps thousands of photographs of celebrities and VIP adorn the walls of this local gem.  The crowds are insane but is organized and efficient.   
,,,,,"Everything is iconic and delicious here.  From the smoked meats, sausages to the soups and pickles, are all wonderful and delicious.  Portions are massive and filling.  Basically when you come in there is 2 choices, the self serve line and the full service line.  I highly recommend if this is your first time, wait in the full service line.  The self serve line can be pretty hectic and stressful if you have no idea what you want."
,,,,,"Also do not lose the ticket that they give you when you enter.  When you order they mark your order on the ticket.    Even if you don't order anything, you need to show your ticket on your way out.  No ticket and you will have to pull a Monopoly and go straight to jail!  Haha!"
,,,,,Solid 4/5!
,,,,,"This place is a MUST TRY if you have not been before! The infamous Katz's Deli (as seen on tv, movies, etc) lives up to its reputation and more! The sandwiches, the fries, pickles, etc...will leave you wanting more (or at least another to take home)!"
,,,,,"It's in the city, so there is only street parking. Take the train, Uber or taxi here and you will not be disappointed at all. You get a ticket when you go in, order, eat, then pay on the way out. But do NOT lose your ticket...that is your exit ticket after you're finished eating and ready to check out. "
,,,,,DO NOT MISS OUT ON KATZ!!!! Go today...if you can!
,,,,,"Finally came to try it to see what the hype is about. The service was great. They have a good system going . I ordered pastrami and corned beef on rye, cole slaw, potato salad, a hot dog and potato latkes. There was nothing good or special about the meats just overly salty and fatty. The cole slaw tasted like straight mayonnaise, the potato salad tasted like straight onions and nothing else. The hot dog was actually pretty good it had the snap when bitten (I enjoyed it). The potato latkes did not taste like anything. I was disappointed, as this place is super hyped. The ambiance is nice (it has pictures of famous people all over) and it was spacious. I don't know if I would come back. There are other places in NYC with better kosher deli food."
,,,,,"First of all there's no parking lot.... and yes I know this is NYC.  Hostess was helpful, with suggesting I use a parking app,  since the parking meter was broken. "
,,,,,"I ordered the brisket sandwich with baked beans and fries. They serve an impressive amount good of meat on their sandwiches, so that's a plus.   The meal over all was okay,  but not great."
,,,,,"Overpriced, overhyped, and not worth the trek. "
,,,,,The ticket system is dumb and I wish these old-school places would realize that they do need to switch it up every now and then.
,,,,,"The sandwich had too much meat, which I guess partly makes up for the price but just charge less and don't make them so big that I need to unhinge my jaw."
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,I'm quite disappointed that this is one of the top eateries in NYC. I tried their Pastrami Hot Sandwich - it was dry and overpriced. It did NOT live up to the hype.
,,,,,"Katz's deli Is a New York institution. If you consider yourself a ""real ""New Yorker, you must have at least once in your life even at Katz's deli. You must sit inside and indoor a slightly obnoxious waiter which is the style. And then prepare yourself for an expensive gigantic sandwich hopefully pastrami with mustard on seeded rye (let's not be a wimp) add french fries and garlic pickles then wash it all down with the celery soda. It's a classic New York combination that's a must try at Katz's Deli.  Once you're hooked on it you'll find your feet bringing you there more often."
,,,,,"I don't really know how it could taste better! We split a corned beef + Swiss cheese + coleslaw with pickles and it was so filling and tasted phenomenal. We got a sample of the pastrami too. Next will have that. Also love that they are taking covid seriously and taking temps, and enforcing the social distance with plastic paneling between cutters. And did I mention the babka? Probably the best dessert I've ever had. Highly recommended."
,,,,,Amazing. Best food ever. My Jewish mouth salivates at the very thought of their pastrami on rye.
,,,,,"Wow. Came here to find out what all the hype was about. They are PACKED. I was almost overwhelmed to not even order but my friend wanted to try for the gram, lol "
,,,,,"So we got our order. It's freaking HUGE. I'm not that much of a meat eater. The meat however is definitely soft and tender. Taste was ok to me, came with a pickle lol I mean it's loaded meat with 2 slices of white bread. I hardly could finish half of my half. "
,,,,,Definitely came here for the experience and do recommend it for meat eaters because you get your monies worth
,,,,,"We're so glad that you enjoyed your first visit! If you want to try dodging the crowd next time, drop by at an off-peak hour: breakfast, between lunch/dinner or late nights on weekends. Hope to see you back again soon for another pastrami fix!"
,,,,,This place is legendary. Still dreaming about their pastrami. It's as good as they say. Mouthwatering and delicious. Tender beef and good sides. The food is worth the wait!
,,,,,"I personally do not rally like this kind if sandwich, but I would have to say that it is a good place for late night food and hanging out with a group of friends. "
,,,,,"We went after 10:00pm, and it was still crowded that it took around 20 mins to us to finish ordering. The good thing is that we did not need to wait in the line outside. "
,,,,,Note: *Make sure you keep your ticket because that's how you order and pay and leave the door. 
,,,,,*Table is available for self server. 
,,,,,*Water is available at the very back.
,,,,,"When it comes to deli sandwiches, I love thick-cut pastrami, and that is what Katz's is known for. It is definitely popular with tourists and for me, I tried it, it was OK and I probably won't be back again. "
,,,,,"My bf and I ordered a half sandwich-pastrami-and half soup-matzo ball-to share. Frankly, I've just had much better pastrami elsewhere, even in small neighborhood deli's back home. The meat lacking that smokey flavor, which in my opinion, is essential for pastrami. The matzo ball soup is just OK as well. It tasted the same as if I was going to dissolve a soup packet in hot water. "
,,,,,"Also, the butchers here either really hate their jobs or they are just plain rude. I understand some people really dislike tourists, but if you applied to work at Katz's then you're kind of asking for it? When there is a clear line in front you, it's not ok to pick out ""locals"" and Spanish-speaking customers to go to the front and order. It's one thing to give me attitude and another to not honor my place in line."
,,,,,Hubby said this is one of the most iconic places to eat in New York and apparently it is. You can see photos of so many celebrities who have visited this place. They opened in 1898 and serve big meat sandwiches. You get a ticket at the entrance and you can order and get a table by yourself. The sandwich had many layers of meat and some mustard sauce. They make it in front of you. 
,,,,,"But honestly I'm not a fan probably because I ordered the corned beef sandwich and it didn't taste as expected! The beef felt so raw. I enjoyed the pickles much more than my sandwich. My husband got the pastrami sandwich which was much better and had a good flavour. But not worth the hype, price and all the stars on Yelp. "
,,,,,Tip- Two people can actually share a sandwich because there is soo much meat!
,,,,,"They shipped out their amazing food all the way to California! We got turkey, pastrami and corned beef along with lox.  They sent along pickles, Russian dressing, sour kraut and mustard. Bagels and rye bread also came.  Of course we added the most delicious potato knishes! For dessert we had chocolate babka and black and white cookies.  Everything came with great instructions for heating and serving! The first box UPS didn't deliver in time so it spoiled which was no fault of Katz. Katz gave us the option of refund or resend.  We picked resend and are so happy we did!  Missing NY deli then make a order here!"
,,,,,We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your meals - we're thrilled to be able to ship a taste of the LES cross country. Hope to see you back again next time you need a long-distance pastrami fix!

,,,,,"The best Deli in New York City for sure -if not the best in the world. Support these wonderful folks and If you have not been here-you must try it. No trip to New York is complete unless you come here to the oldest surviving authentic NY deli, since 1888."
,,,,,Pastrami is the top seller-along with the Corned Beef and Brisket. Salami is great also.
,,,,,Everything on the menu is always good. Service is friendly and quick.
,,,,,Stop by Katz today. You'll be glad you did.
,,,,,We're so glad to hear you've enjoyed your visits here - our long-time fans are the backbone of our restaurant. Hope to see you back again soon!
,,,,,Spent over $50 on two sandwiches and got accused of trying to steal pickles at the check out. Are you serious??????? FYI your pickles and sandwiches aren't worth stealing. Great way to loose business.
,,,,,"Things were going great until I got to the cashier. I wanted more pickles and I saw some at the check out and some guy behind the counter starts screaming that their not free. Obviously I know they're not free, so I asked him why he would think I'm trying steal pickles and he says I saw you grabbing things. I took some toothpicks and a menu, so why am I, a paying customer being accused of trying to steal some pickles. Then I'm told that I should of asked an employee for the pickles, okay cool but there's no sign so how do I know this. Bottom line I was incredibly insulted by this guys assumptions, I didn't travel to this deli to be called a thief. Customer service was horrible, especially since his co workers seemed to back him and just tried to get rid of me. I guess for whatever reason they must think since they do good business, then that means they can treat some like crap. Been there done that, never again."
,,,,,"Love the brisket!!! It's a bit on the salty side, but so yummy!! The portion is huge for the sandwich."
,,,,,Awesome as usual! Never disappoints! Gotta go!
,,,,,Had it for breakfast the other day . No line no wait
,,,,,Best ever? 
,,,,,Got the pastrami and brisket sandwich. 
,,,,,Pastrami is the best I've eaten by far 
,,,,,Brisket is tasty and tender 
,,,,,Outdoor seating 
,,,,,Great customer service 
,,,,,They make the sandwich in front of you 
,,,,,Price is great for the quality of the food 
,,,,,Great classic establishment 
,,,,,Definitely check it out
,,,,,Been to NYC a few times and this was our first time trying Katz. They get incredibly busy but if you go off peak hours the wait isn't too bad and it's not too hard to find a table.
,,,,,"We got their famous pastrami sandwich and although it was good, it was not as juicy as I had hoped and really needed the mustard otherwise it felt a bit dry. For $22 usd I expected better. Maybe we went on an off day. Schwartz in Montreal was much more melt in your mouth. Glad we tried it but wouldn't need to go back."
,,,,,Food was delicious and HUGE portions. Cutters were very nice and the meat was very tender. It is VERY expensive ~$20 per sandwich without a drink or anything else. We went late at night so it wasn't busy at all which was nice.
,,,,,The ticket system is ridiculous. You get a ticket when you get in and they keep tabs on your order as you choose. When you leave you either show your ticket stapled to your receipt if you put with card or if you are paying with cash you take your ticket up front. 
,,,,,"We only used one ticket, so we showed him the ticket for ~$100 for 3 people. They still wanted our other blank tickets. One of the people in our party couldn't find theirs and it felt like we were gonna get bounced for it despite saying we all shared one ticket instead of individual tickets. He was told to go back to his table and check. When he still couldn't find it, it was very uncomfortable.  Eventually he was able to find it and we went on our way but that really put a bad taste in our mouth for this old iconic place to basically shake you down for a ticket. It wasn't busy at the time we went so we obviously weren't stealing. "
,,,,,"While the food was great, the steep price and the crappy ticket system means I likely won't be back next time I am in town."
,,,,,"We're so sorry to hear that you had such a negative experience - we never want any of our customers to feel frustrated by our service or the ticket process. Part of our charm for many of our customers is our ""old-school New York"" attitude, including our payment system, but we understand that the atmosphere is not for everybody. That being said, the treatment you received should absolutely never be the case - we will take your experience to heart and address it immediately. Please feel free to call and speak to a manager any time."
,,,,,"The surly staff hands people a ticket when they enter, then harasses people for leaving without returning the ticket. The food is good, if wildly overpriced,  the waiters are nice, but the security team and hostesses are borderline hostile."
,,,,,"I honestly do not understand the hype for this place. Always long lines out the door waiting for a bit of corned beef and mayo on rye. It's any other deli but it's become cool to go there and people decide it's the place to be. To be fair if you're a sandwich person with bland taste (and this is in no way a bad thing - do your thing, love the diversity of taste buds) then this might be the place for you. However, everywhere that has a toaster might also be the place for you"
,,,,,Great pastrami if you're into it! They make you wait in a separate long line if you pay by card (bc who doesn't love cash to avoid taxes!) so better if you have cash.
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,"One time I walked in, got confused but intrigued by the ticket thing (thankfully there wasn't a line) and saw the pastrami Reuben was like 21 dollars and I headed for the door. Sorry katz, good job Gate keeping!"
,,,,,Best sandwiches as I can remember visiting this place years ago and the memory is still there.
,,,,,"It was like $35 dollars for their famous pastrami sandwich, but when we got it from delivery. It was soo worst it, it's huge portion, you can enjoy it for lunch  and have the rest for dinner. It's soo good . We love it"
,,,,,"I recently ordered a box of delicious food from Katz's and it was the BEST. 1lb pastrami,  1lb corned beef,  1lb brisket. "
,,,,,"A jar of sour pickles, a jar of half sour pickles,  2 loaves rye, 2 jars mustard......everything was perfect. Worth every penny and then some.  Delivery was fast, packaging incredibly secure. "
,,,,,Thank you Katz's for the magnificent food.
,,,,,We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your meal - we're thrilled to be able to ship a taste of New York long distance! Hope to see you back again next time you're in town.
,,,,,Katz's Delicatessen is a life changing foodie experience. I've seen Katz's on multiple food/travel TV shows in the past and I've been dying to try this place out since. Cue a trip to New York to cross Katz's off my culinary bucket list. My meal at Katz's Delicatessen absolutely met (if not exceeded) my extremely high expectations walking in. 
,,,,,"On the note of walking in, this place is a bit anxiety-inducing if you're not a fan of crowds. It was absolutely packed when we came around 1:30 pm on a weekday. Luckily, Katz's has a system down. You can either put your name down for table seating, or you can order at the deli counter and find seating. It was a neat experience to see the deli boys cut the meat, and it was awesome that they give you samples of each meat so you can try it before committing. While it was so insanely crowded in here (almost shoulder to shoulder at some points), there are at least five different lines you can order from and the lines move relatively quickly."
,,,,,"My partner and I decided on getting a pastrami reuben and a corned beef reuben. These were legitimately the best reubens I've had in my entire life. I still dream about both, and it makes my foodie heart sad that I can only eat this in New York. It's hard to pick a favorite of the two, as both were so damn good. I will mention though that the corned beef was a bit leaner and lighter tasting than the pastrami, which was richer and heavier. "
,,,,,"The reubens were put together excellently; the bread well-toasted, the cheese gooey and melty, and the spread filled with delicious diced pickles. However, what really made these sandwiches special were the meats. The meat was so tender that it just fell apart in my mouth and it was so well-seasoned, highlighting the wonderful marbling throughout the cuts of meat. Words alone simply don't do the taste justice; just trust me (and the other 11,000+ reviews) that you absolutely need to try Katz's at least once in your life. Yes, this is a $20 sandwich. But for the portion size (I didn't finish my sandwiches and I regret it SO much that I didn't eat all of it) and the overall taste, it's worth every single penny. Plus, you're in New York! Things are generally expensive. "
,,,,,"In short, Katz's Delicatessen lives up to all of the hype. My meal at Katz's was one of the best meals I've ever had. The only downside is that Katz's has now set the bar so high for what a delicious reuben tastes like."
,,,,,"PS: Everyone get a ticket when they walk in. The sandwich guys write your order on the ticket and you present your ticket to the cashier to pay. Even if you don't order anything, make sure that you hold on to your ticket and present it to the cashier with the rest of your party. If you don't have your ticket, you'll get hit with a $50 fine!"
,,,,,I dont get what the fuss is about. Almost $20 for a half pound of smoked grease. No grease trimming whatsoever. Full on heart attack sandwich. Tastes good --how can it NOT when it's so fatty? You'd have to be pretty stupid to screw up a smoked grease sandwich. Could've easily made this at home for a couple dollars.
,,,,,"I kinda cheated going here... It was definitely on my list for the trip so even though we didn't have time to eat at Katz, we decided to buy a pastrami sandwich to go, and eat it on the plane ride home."
,,,,,"Since I knew I wouldn't get to eat the sandwich until a couple of hours, I did sneak a quick bite to try it while it was hot.  It was excellent.  The mustard is fabulous."
,,,,,"Some 4/5 hours later, I ate the rest of the sandwich.  I have to admit, even cold, it was fantastic.  The pickles are a nice touch."
,,,,,"Why can't I give this place 6 stars or even 7?! This place is literally the embodiment of what a sandwich should taste like. If God goes down from the heavens to eat a sandwich, I am 110% sure he or she would eat here. This deli joint feels like a DMV from the inside with Disneyland lines from outside to their order counters. The employees are the best as well because they give this place that NYC feel, hardworking, tough looking, but very helpful. They have collection of pictures of famous people on all of their walls and that is a sight to behold. Anyway..  leggo on the food shall we..."
,,,,,"I ordered their Pastrami sandwich, which is melt in your mouth.Their sandwich is simple; a meat (which is pastrami for me) and a rye bread. Their meat feels like butter when you're eating it. I am actually having foodgasm by just describing it. Their rye bread is thick enough to hold that juicy, meaty goodness, not to mention it is best the best dough in the business, as well. My girlfriend ordered their Corned Beef, which we shared half and half. This, too have the same quality as the Pastrami, so you can nevet go wrong ordering what. "
,,,,,"For the our refreshments, we ordered their Egg Cream shake. So good, taste like a way better version of an eggnog. It is the right drink to compliment the best sandwich I ever had. Yes, I said it! No doubt about it! Overall, if I get bored, I would go to NYC for a day just to eat here.. that's how I love this place :)"
,,,,,PS: Hey why is my picture not on those walls?! I am famous being yelp elite lol
,,,,,PSS: I can only dream haha
,,,,,We're so thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your meal - there's nothing we love more than making new fans. Drop by again next time you're in town and give our Reuben a whirl!
,,,,,"Visited Katz's pre-covid (January) because it's an iconic NY place to eat. Given how popular this place is, I was surprised with how easy and quick the whole experience was. I kept it simple with a pastrami sandwich and matzo ball soup. While the man was making my pastrami sandwich he gave let my try some of the meat while I waited. We sat by the Harry Met Sally table which was pretty cool. Overall a great experience!"
,,,,,Is it expensive? Yes. Is it an awesome pastrami sandwich? Heck yes.
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,5 stars because hands down it's the best pastrami you will ever have. 
,,,,,"If you've never been please visit. You don't go for the service it is for the sheer love of the food. The steak fries, the pastrami, the hot dogs, the mustard, the rye bread, the pickles...oh I could go on!!!"
,,,,,Be prepared to wait in line if it is the weekend and have people hover over you while you eat and they wait for a table. 
,,,,,If you're local and just want the best pastrami and don't live close to Harold's which is a distant second go late at night to avoid the crowds and lines and just deal with those visiting after partying. 
,,,,,They are now up to $23 for pastrami on rye and yes it's worth every red cent!
,,,,,Might have dreams about this sandwich. We are from Chicago and happened to be a staying a block away. We came across this place on accident (we know it's basically famous) . It's pretty chaotic when you walk in so I'll explain the process:
,,,,,1) you get a ticket at the door and move up to a cutter - don't lose the ticket 
,,,,,"2) order your sandwich - they give you a taste of a sample to make sure you like it (you will, duh). You hand the cutter your ticket and he writes your order "
,,,,,3) go sit and eat . There are some tables reserved for waiter service so you need to choose a table that doesn't say that 
,,,,,"4) if you pay cash- you had your ticket to the register at the front. Card, is the back of the inside area"
,,,,,5) you leave happy and full 
,,,,,we shared a sandwich because they're huge- but highly recommend ! So so good .
,,,,,"One of just a few places that age their meats the way Katz's does. Katz's makes a monster of a sandwich, featuring 3/4 pounds of meat per sandwich. It can be a lot. I usually take some off the sandwich and use it to make another sandwich! "
,,,,,"The meat is fantastic. It's briny, and tender. The pastrami and corn beef is aged for 30 days and smoked. I can't really say anything other than ""go here!"" This is a place that you put in your top 3 list when visiting NYC. Not many tourists anymore and so I only waited 5 minutes for a sandwich. I tend to go for the bagel and lox sandwich here though I recommend Russ and Daughters for that. However, the Lox offered at Katz's is of the highest quality but they aren't known for selling smoked fish and so they only have one type of lox."
,,,,,I am so glad this place survived and the U.S. government issued paycheck protection for Katz's employees. They aren't losing business either because of international shipping through Goldbelly. And that's good because this place is a huge part of foodie culture here in NYC and I hope it stays that way.
,,,,,Katz's never disappoints.  Even in the middle of a global pandemic they have made necessary adjustments to ensure the experience of dining here remains exceptional.  Every employee is kind and engaging with the customers.  I recommend this place to everyone time and time again.
,,,,,We're so glad to hear you've enjoyed your visits here - hope to see you back again soon for another Reuben fix!
,,,,,I'll keep this short and sweet. Came here after a comedy show around 3AM on a Saturday-- PACKED. 
,,,,,Food: Pastrami sandwich is the way to go. Flavorful pastrami on rye bread smothered in tangy mustard . The pickles are great and the fries and HOT and fresh. 
,,,,,Service: fast and indifferent. 
,,,,,There is a bouncer that gives you a ticket upon entering.. this is how you pay and how you get out of the place. 
,,,,,*** KEEP your ticket or else you will not get out the door***
,,,,,We're so glad that you enjoyed your first visit - drop by again soon and give the Reuben a try!
,,,,,"The best of the best. The pastrami is perfection. The beef tongue soft and delectable with both center cut and tip available. The stuffed derma was as good as I've ever had. Everything on the menu is perfect, just a matter of getting what you want. Don't be silly and order a tuna sandwich with fries or something equivalent and you'll leave happy and full"
,,,,,"I still can't believe I paid $25 for a pastrami sandwich, but it was absolutely worth it in this case. I came in a Friday just before noon and it was not busy at all. They give you a ticket right as you walk in that must handed back before you exit. So make sure you don't lose it! "
,,,,,The pastrami sandwich was DELICIOUS. The meat was so soft and melts in your mouth. The meat cutters even offer a little sample to try while waiting for your sandwich to be made. Definitely one of my favorites places that I ate in NY.
,,,,,NY Staple. Blintz or bust. Avoid the crowds by going at obscure hours. The best late night deli after a pre-lockdown night out.
,,,,,"A new york city staple, no first trip to the city is complete if you don't stop here."
,,,,,"Best pastrami ever! along with absolutely worst customer service!  i Dropped my blank punch card and they harassed me to pay $50 to leave.  I stood my ground and guess what, after a miserable 15minutes fighting with them they finally admitted they had it all along as someone had turned it in.  Wtf"
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,"Katz was on our list for our NY trip this past week. Luckily it was a short walk from our hotel. When you arrive to Katz, you're given a ticket per person. Keep this since you'll need it to pay on your way out. "
,,,,,"There are a few cutters so you can pick any line and any of them can serve you. The wait was maybe 10 mins or so in our line so it wasn't bad at all. While he's slicing your food, he gives samples of the meat for you to try!"
,,,,,+ Pastrami Reuben Sandwich - 8/10 - this was pretty good. I got the half size and even that I couldn't finish. It was huge and they give you a good portion of meat. The sandwich will most likely fall apart while you're eating it. 
,,,,,+ Matzoball Soup - 8/10 - I got the cup size and it was the perfect portion. The matzoball was delicious and the broth was well seasoned. My only issue was that the soup was lukewarm and I wish it had been hot since it was a rainy NY night. 
,,,,,+ Corned Beef Sandwich - 10/10 - my fiancé's pick. I've never had corned beef but I tried some of his sandwich and it was delicious! He said it's one of the best he's had. 
,,,,,They also give you a plate of pickles to eat. Seating is first come first but there's a ton of seating so you'll be able to find a spot pretty easily. Overall you can expect to pay between $25-30 a person. Definitely give Katz's a try!
,,,,,Best Best Sandwiches EVER!!! We go in 2-3 times a year and buy a couple Pastrami on Rye! Never ever disappointed at Katz!  You have never had a good pastrami on rye unless you you've had theirs. Not Bens not Zans. They're nothing like Katz these are worth every dime!!!!
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear you've enjoyed your visits here - our long-time fans are the backbone of our restaurant, and make our jobs so rewarding. Hope to see you back again soon for another pastrami fix!"
,,,,,Legendary Hot Pastrami sandwiches. A favorite since childhood. Meat piled high. Tip:   Put a few dollars in the cup on the counter when ordering and ask for extra lean. They'll cut off the excess fat.
,,,,,"This is an unreal experience and I loved it! You could really tell this is a New Yorkers business, the staff got it down, they know what they're doing."
,,,,,You walk in and there's a crowd of people in front of the meats who are all tasting the meat and ordering. Other people are sitting down at tables already and waiting if they're getting table service. Everyone who comes in also gets a ticket which you will give back to them when you leave.
,,,,,"We sat down and our waitress came up to us and asked us what we wanted. We said we wanted to try out the brisket, tongue, and salami before we ordered. She said the kitchen won't like that we asked for all of that and she thinks the salami is a waste so we just got the brisket and tongue. The brisket had flavor but it was dry and the tongue was ok but this is probably why everyone goes for the pastrami."
,,,,,"Got 2 pastrami sandwiches, some latkes, and the pickled veggies. Those Latkes went well with the applesauce and cream cheese that it comes with. They are a little dense but you dont even notice when they're paired with those condiments. It was a pleasant surprise. Next great surprise was their pickled veggies! Very ironic but I liked the veggies that weren't the pickles the best! I'd say the green tomatoes were the best, 2nd the celery sticks, 3rd the pickles, lastly the cucumbers. I think it's because the pickles seemed overly salty and the cucumbers didn't have much flavor at all. The waitress said she had to dig for those celery sticks so thank you to you girl! They were even a little spicy which is what I like! When we ordered the pastrami sandwiches she said some people want mayo on it but she considers that a sin. One of us got it with mayo and the other one with swiss cheese added. I didn't think it needed mayo but I loved the cheese with it."
,,,,,"Dining experience-wise, this place is loud and crowded. We came by 11 so it was crowded inside but no line out the door yet. By the time we left around noon there was a line out there. New Yorkers work here so be prepared for their attitude and style(it's not personal so don't take it that way). One thing I did have to note was that 15% gratuity wasn't a good enough tip for our waitress, she actually got 30+% but I guess she expected 20% per person. We split our bill between 2 people and each did 15% and then we left some cash on the table as well. But she shook her head when she saw the 15% both times and said sarcastically that she must've been a bitch or done something wrong."
,,,,,"Items we didn't order but I saw are popular were their matzo ball soup, steak fries, and coleslaw."
,,,,,"I'd come back here for the experience and I'll stick to early morning times because that seems to be prime. They have other items I'd try, maybe I'll do breakfast instead of lunch. All I know is I can trust I'll get an authentic NY experience here."
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your first visit - we love making new fans. Though we do often serve a packed house, the best times to try dodging the crowd are breakfast, between lunch/dinner and late nights on weekends. Hope to see you back again soon - next time give our Reuben a try!"
,,,,,"It was my first time here so it was a little confusing at first. They handed each one of us a ticket even though I was had asked to be seated at a table with wait staff for our party of 6. You have the option of ordering at your own will and finding seating or there are tables along the back wall that are reserved for parties with waitstaff only. In the end, we found seats near one another which was fine since it was such a quick meal. "
,,,,,"We ordered the Reuben with pastrami. Best pastrami sandwich I've ever had! Pastrami was melt in your mouth, paired with the sauerkraut and mustard gave the sandwich a great balance, making it not feel so heavy. Just don't lose your ticket and bring cash if you're paying out front. I hear you can pay by card in the back."
,,,,,"You can't help but eat at Katz's every now and then. It brings you back to you early twenties, stumbling in late at night for the most expensive pastrami on rye you've ever had. The food is still delicious, the staff is still rude, but I wouldn't change a thing."
,,,,,The only reason this isn't a one is the sandwich. The turkey was actually very tender and the sandwich was stuffed full of turkey. 
,,,,,You queue to get in and then queue to order your food. Then you try to find a seat if you don't queue for ages for waiter service. 
,,,,,"Be warned it's ridiculously busy. I am not sure if there is a ""good"" time to visit. "
,,,,,Staff are pretty much meh about the whole thing. I'm sure they're over the hype!
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your sandwich, but sorry that you had such a negative experience. Though part of our charm for many of our customers is our ""old-school New York"" attitude, we understand that the atmosphere is not for everybody - we never want any customer to feel confused or dismissed. We do often serve quite a packed house, but if you want to try dodging the crowds, drop by at an off-peak hour: breakfast, between lunch/dinner or late nights on weekends. We hope you'll give us another chance to serve you up the perfect sandwich!"
,,,,,"I went to the location City Point down town Brooklyn. Pastrami on rye Delicious! Service good, fast courteous. Generous portions."
,,,,,"One of my favorite bites in New York! Every bite required minimal tearing and hard chewing; it was all so tender and easy to sink your teeth into. The pastrami sandwich actually wasn't as big as I expected, and it may be a bit too pricey to have more often."
,,,,,I'd recommend making a visit here; there's probably no where else outside of New York where you can get a decent pastrami sandwich.
,,,,,What: Pastrami on rye
,,,,,How much: $22.00
,,,,,How does it work: Walk in or sit down. They give you a ticket at the door and you give the ticket to the counter once your sandwich is made. You pay when you exit the place since the cashier is by the door. 
,,,,,"Review: Thick stacks of meat. Very well seasoned and cooked perfectly. They let you try the meat before you buy, that's a plus for me. Can definitely shareable between 2 people unless you can eat fat stack of meats."
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,Is it chaos? YES
,,,,,Is there a wait? YES
,,,,,Is it expensive? YES 
,,,,,Is it worth it tho..? YESSSSSSSSSSSS 
,,,,,"Honestly, if its your first time please please try the pastrami.. i mean its what they're KNOWN for.. don't get me wrong.. I'm sure all the other sandwiches/items are good but its the same thing as going to a 5 star steak restaurant known for their dry aged steaks and ordering chicken.. i mean.. dont you want to rate the food on what they're good at and the reason why everybody is lining up for?! They offer the other menu items probably as a side so other people who don't like pastrami can have some bomb food but seriously tho.. COME ON. Maybe i'm being a little mean but if you get food.. it would make some sort of sense to you. "
,,,,,I come from the home of Langers in Los Angeles.. which is OUR version of Katz (but i think Langers is better by a TAD (: ). 
,,,,,Like all the other reviews.. get the REUBEN! You can easily share it so you don't get stuffed till you can't move! 
,,,,,"The main reason why I took off one star was bc of the overall cleanliness of the restaurant. They try to clean as much as possible which I get.. its crazy in there.. the space is SMALL. However, the floors are dirty and when we went the vents were leaking!! So it felt like getting rained on by dirty water :( . I didn't let that ruin my experience but it was definitely worth taking one star off."
,,,,,My boyfriend was a happy camper and it is definitely a place we would go back when we visit. We kind of like the chaos feel... feels very new york.
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear that you've enjoyed your experiences here. We will take your feedback to heart - unfortunately sometimes during busy periods we see as many as 4000 people in a day, and it's challenging to monitor everything that goes on as much as we try to make sure it's perfect! Hope to see you back again soon for another pastrami fix."
,,,,,"We tried Pastrami and Reuben with Pastrami. The winner Reuben Pastrami, period, period, period!"
,,,,,"Sides: potato salad and coleslaw, both are good but if you have to get one, definitely the potato salad. "
,,,,,"The assembly line can be quite confusing for first timers. Hot dog, sandwiches, sides and drinks are all in each own separate lines/stations. Good things there were 3 of us so we divided into 3 stations."
,,,,,This place was poppin! They allowed us to try the meats before making our selection and they were both delicious. With went for the pastrami sandwich so juicy!
,,,,,I only share reviews when something is intolerable. Today Cutter #2 was horrible. I went with a friend of mine and cutter #2 did both our orders in less then 3 mins. My brisket order was extremely cold. It seems as if the brisket was out for long and he decided to use that for my order. What a disgrace. Cutter #2 did 2 orders while others were still being served in a proper manner. Cutter #2 talks too much and is not focused on his job. He doesn't practice the CDC guidelines as well. I am almost thinking of never going back due to this employee. Cutter #2 is a heavy set hispanic man who tries to make jokes on other hispanics. 
,,,,,"Since I drove from Yonkers all the way to the city, I was not going to go back. I decided to calls Katz to resolve this matter. No answer! "
,,,,,This is completely unprofessional.
,,,,,AVOID CUTTER #2!
,,,,,"As seen in the movie, ""When Harry Met Sally"" .... The orgasmic scene between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan.  Actually sit at the table that took place in the movie and re-enact the scene! While you're there, order the BEST pastrami on rye sandwiches in the world!"
,,,,,I was crazy overwhelmed the second I walked into this place. I had no idea of the rules or the way that Katz's is run so I was just confused. I'm still not sure how it works.
,,,,,"We got in line at a ""cutter"" but let's be real - it is chaos, people running into me, trying to cut in line, etc. You kind of have to shove other people to get to the front of the counter."
,,,,,"For some odd reason that I still don't know the answer to, is that the ""cutters"" give you slices of the meat to try first before they make your sandwich. I'm ordering the sandwich anyway, why do I need to try some slices ahead of time and just get full off of those? But we had a corned beef sandwich and a pastrami sandwich. I hated the corned beef but the pastrami was very good, it melted in your mouth. WAY too much mustard on the sandwiches though. I also don't like pickles but we tried the pickles it came with and hated them both."
,,,,,"My biggest problem here besides the complete madhouse inside, is how freakin' expensive the sandwiches are here! We only got 2 sandwiches and paid more than FORTY DOLLARS. How ridiculous. The sandwiches are overFLOWING with meat, so much that a human could not eat an entire sandwich. So if you just give us a normal amount of meat, you don't have to charge $25 a sandwich."
,,,,,"Overall, the pastrami sandwich was good but it's certainly not worth the price."
,,,,,Great food. Great Prices. This will forever and always be one of my all time favorite deli's to visit. It's truly legendary
,,,,,"Hobbled all the way from Broadway trying to make it here to purchase 3 pastrami sandwiches, yes $75 worth of SANDWHICHES and was told by the manager that there was one carver and I needed to be at the location by 10:45. "
,,,,,"Okay, so I made it. We made it by 10:42 and now everything's closed and cleaned? "
,,,,,NOT HAPPY! You could have told me that while I was saying I was on my way to you that everyone was cleaned up and you closed for the night instead of wasting my money and my time. NOT HAPPY. Returning to Las Vegas minus Katz.
,,,,,"Katz's diner seems to pop up in the intersection of the venn diagram of most foodies' to-go lists and most tourist guide books, so expect long lines for the experience. The word usage is purposefully chosen; it's the experience of frequenting Katz's, more so than the food, that you are buying. We went mid-Saturday and there was a fairly long line, though at least the line moved quickly."
,,,,,"Honestly, the experience was quite hectic. After you enter the shop, you're given a number, which you must depart with or pay the price, since presenting the number and the proof of your payment is how you exit. Once you're inside, the orderly line gives way to a chaotic free-for-all. It's fairly confusing to figure out which line you're supposed to be in, and if you blindly get in line it's very possible to wait for twenty minutes, only to get to the front and find out that you've been in the wrong line all along. Not to mention the fact that you have to wade through a horde of people in order to get to the back, where you're actually paying for the food. As a pair who did not necessarily go in with a game plan, we felt quite lost. If you have an aversion to crowds and dislike people jostling to get to the front of a confusing queue, this is not the place for you."
,,,,,"Not wanting to wait to be seated, we chose to order our food to go and eat in a park a few blocks away. We ended up getting the pastrami sandwich and the matzo ball soup. I liked the taste of the pastrami, and can see why it made the diner so famous. The portions were filling, and the food was good, but it was quite possibly the most expensive soup and sandwich combo I'd ever ordered, by a long shot. Like I said earlier, you're paying for the experience."
,,,,,"Giving Katz three stars because while the food was good, the prices were steep, and the experience was unnecessarily stressful. It's one of those things I'm glad I checked off once, but probably won't be back to do again."
,,,,,"I had what she was having, and I loved every second of it!"
,,,,,"Nice retro style Deli with wall to wall pictures and neon signs. We got a pastrami sandwich, piled high. The guy at the Deli even gave us a couple stripes extra as a preview."
,,,,,"I heard the cheesecake is good here too, but I didn't get a chance to have it. The half sandwich was pretty filling on its own."
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,Preferred the corn beef over the pastrami. 
,,,,,"The potato knish is hot, soft, comforting, and the perfect type of bland. "
,,,,,The mustard is God-like. I will be ordering bottles. It added an incredible burst of flavor to the sandwich and knish. It was as if everything in this deli was made for this mustard. 
,,,,,"Service - Rude, confusing, and disorderly on Friday 10AM."
,,,,,Cash only.
,,,,,"Pastrami Sandwich - $21 for the most monstrously delicious, fluffy, light, and savory piece of pastrami you will ever have your entire life. It is perfection."
,,,,,Size - Two humongous halves about as big as your head. You will never finish the whole thing in one sitting.
,,,,,"Matzo Ball Soup - Homey, warm, and salty. The ball of carbs is dense and comforting. "
,,,,,Wait time - Fast. Lines move efficiently. It reminds me of Philz Coffee where you line up in front of any chef and start ordering. They gave samples of the meat as they cooked so the meat you sample is the freshest it will ever be.
,,,,,Great sandwiches as always. I hope the crowds stay away as it's been great going down there during covid with no line.
,,,,,The pastrami is absolutely delicious!  
,,,,,"First thing's first- you receive a ticket upon entering so be sure to hold on to it or they charge you $50.  You can bet your bottom dollar that they will hold you to it as they constantly communicate with the security guard as how many people are allowed to exit.  It's a bit confusing but there are multiple cutter stations as well as a separate station for drinks.  There are also tables reserved specifically for dine in for those who are claustrophobic from the lines.  Otherwise, you can try to fight for THE table for the iconic scene from when Harry met Sally.  "
,,,,,I was surprised that no one seemed to budge when I dived for it but it's definitely worth some fun photos.  
,,,,,"Anyways, the pastrami is delicious and definitely enough to share if you're not starving.  It is so thick, tender, and amazing!  A bit pricey compared to other places but also thicker and obviously one with a big reputation.  I would come back time and time again for the pastrami alone."
,,,,,"First time I ate at Katz was over 60 years ago...growing up in Brooklyn, it was my family's go to deli. Drove there today from NJ for a nostalgic takeout combo fix...and couldn't have been more disappointed with the quality of our sandwiches."
,,,,,"Absolutely inedible...Literally wound up throwing them out. What a waste of $50 for 2 sandwiches, + tolls and time!!!"
,,,,,Sad
,,,,,We're sorry to hear that you were so disappointed by your meal - we never want our customers to be anything less than thrilled by their experiences. Please feel free to call and speak to a manager anytime!
,,,,,"Even though Covid is still very much present, Katz's was still absolutely delicious and perfect. It's very hard to go wrong here, especially since I ordered the Hot Pastrami on Rye (with spicy brown mustard). There's not much more to say. You'll rarely be let down. It's a national institution for a reason."
,,,,,Food is always outstanding but too expensive. Pre-covid it was horrible to get into the restaurant. Hopefully things slowed down. Also there is a small Katz in Brooklyn if you don't want to go to Manhattan. In a basement of a mall with a bunch of other eateries. It's called Taste of Katz 445 Albee sq. Brooklyn try it out.
,,,,,"Thank you God for this amazing place. And thank you God for the amazing staff and the great quality food. We were on a food tour that day and we started off with this place. We expected it to be the best we had all day and it definitely was the best food we had all day. I love that when you order a big pastrami sandwich they give you a nice little sample. You already know the food is going to be delicious, but it's just great that they give you a nice piece of pastrami to wet your appetite. Let's not get it twisted, the food is pretty delicious and it is pretty pricey. But when you are Manhattan this place is a must. It has been here for so many years and it seems like they are big on tradition and they don't change their ways. I can appreciate that as a person who really loves food and critiques food for fun, I can appreciate a place that sticks to what they are good at.This place is doing it right and I was so glad that there wasn't a line inside."
,,,,,We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your visit - we love making new fans. Drop by again next time you're in town and give our Reuben a try!
,,,,,The undisputed heavy weight champion of pastrami is here. Nowhere else does a better pastrami sandwich exist. This is the standard. Eating this will just put every other pastrami sandwich you've had to shame and ruin the future ones.
,,,,,"I'd like to know where New Yorkers go for pastrami's.  When I was there, everyone looked like tourists. I have to believe New Yorkers don't pay $24 for a pastrami sandwich, no matter how good it is.  "
,,,,,"For me, it's a once and done.  The pastrami was very good.  But we have equally good pastrami at Langers back home.  And I don't experience  nearly the sticker shock, including $7 for a scoop of slaw.  "
,,,,,And that outdated New York attitude I can do without.  Is that intentional for the tourists or do they just really don't give a F.  The only smile I got was from the cashier.   Call me old fashion but a few smiles would be nice when I m shelling out $40 for a soup and sandwich with a side of slaw.
,,,,,"We're glad that you enjoyed your meal, but sorry that you were somewhat disappointed by our service - though part of our charm for many of our customers is our ""old-school New York"" attitude, we understand that the atmosphere is not for everybody. It wasn't meant to be rude, just schtick - but we would love to have you come in and experience the food without the attitude. We will take your experience to heart - please feel free to call and talk to a manager at any time."
,,,,,I JUST MISS THE CARNEGIE!!!!!
,,,,,"I do like Katz's very, very much, but it's sure not (in my opinion) as great as the Carnegie was...."
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,"We heard so much about this place, and I'm a big fan of pastrami sandwich so I was really excited to try this place. Maybe I was hyped up too much by others, and it wasn't as good as I expected. But it was still good! We got a pastrami sandwich which is about $25. Me and my husband shared one sandwich, and since we weren't too hungry, it was definitely enough for the two of us. We also wanted to save some space for desserts too!  We got the sandwich to go, went to Brooklyn bridge park and ate there!"
,,,,,It's an institution but expensive and zero ambience. Not many NYC delis left so probably the best of what's left.
,,,,,"I'll just add to the rest of the 10,000+ reviews and say I have been visiting NYC for over 20 years and felt this was just another tourist trap. It's not. "
,,,,,"Do yourself a favor, embrace the line, come hungry and taste one of the best pieces of meat you'll ever have in your life. My 1/2 matza ball soup and 1/2 hot pastrami sandwich was one of the best $20 meals I ever had. I can't begin to describe the taste of this meat other than its just an essential experience everyone must undertake. "
,,,,,"1 star docked for cleanliness. Understand its busy, there are a ton of people traveling in and out, but after braving lines and perhaps long commutes to try the famous Katz, I would love to eat my food with clean floors, clean tables, and clean silverware."
,,,,,"This place is awesome. They have outside seating. If you are craving for a mouth watering sandwich this is the place for you. A bit expensive but well deserved. Pictures speak for themselves.  friendly, just be ready to order. Should be in everyone's bucket list. Will be coming back."
,,,,,We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your visit - hope to see you back again soon for another pastrami fix!
,,,,,Awesome and delicious even with the long lines. Highly recommend the pastrami sandwich
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your meal. And if you ever want to try dodging the crowds, drop by at an off-peak hour - breakfast, or between lunch/dinner. Hope to see you back again soon!"
,,,,,"I came here because my friends wanted to.  My attitude was positive but practical.  How much better can a pastrami sandwich be than all the other pastrami sandwiches I've had before? Well - I have learned my lesson! Although the sandwich is quite costly, the line is long, and the service can be a bit less than friendly... I'd eat here every day if possible! Holy frick - I don't know what they did to the pastrami but it was better than any sandwich meat I've ever had by far! And the bread- don't get me started!  I can't stand rye...  and theirs is delightfully delicious! How is it possible? I don't know, I don't care, I just want it again! "
,,,,,Don't lose your ticket!
,,,,,Worth the wait- worth the price-Indulge yourself!
,,,,,"Heaven on earth. No other pastrami sandwich compares anymore because of this place! A little on the speedy side but if you're looking for great quality food, look no further!"
,,,,,"Never a disappointment at this restaurant. This place is always clean, the service is 5 star and the food speaks for itself."
,,,,,Brisket was dry and the manager was rude and didn't let me exchange for something else.
,,,,,"This deli has been around since 1888 and is  famous for way more than being the site of the ""orgasm scene"" in ""When Harry Met Sally"".  "
,,,,,The sandwiches here are HUGE!!! I ordered the 1/2 pastrami sandwich with matzo ball soup and it was  more than enough to fill me up. The flavor was great too! They take pride in what they make. I would come back again because the meat was so tasty and this was my first time trying matzo soup and I loved it. 
,,,,,You can either get table service or you can wait in line at the counter and then find a seat. Waiting at the counter tends to be a shorter wait time. 
,,,,,When you walk in you are handed a yellow ticket and you give that to the carver behind the counter who marks it up with what you ordered. You dO that at the drink station as well and then pay at the final counter. They take cash or card.

,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,"Ok, so I waited in line outside on a cool and drizzly day for lunch about 35 minutes before getting inside and waiting another 10 minutes before getting to the counter to order. Of course when entering I was given my ticket and instructed not to lose it. I ordered a 1/2 pastrami sandwich with a bowl of matzo ball soup for $19. The meat cutter who took my order marked my ticket with what I ordered so the ticket represents your bill that is paid when you leave. All of the table service area was full so I opted for counter service and after getting my food found an empty table to sit down at and eat. "
,,,,,"The sandwich was actually smaller than I expected but still was very good. Quality ingredients make for quality food and the pastrami, bread and soup were all yummy and filling. It was a very good meal. I consider this place to be a must stop if in Manhattan and easy to get to with a subway stop just a block away. When leaving you must present your ticket to pay and leave. If you are using a credit card you have to pay in the rear of the restaurant. With cash you pay up front near the entrance. The sign says lost tickets require a $50 fee so don't lose yours!"
,,,,,"P.S. If you only want water to drink they have a free water dispenser in the rear of the restaurant. Also, it's neat to walk,around and look at the pictures of all of the celebrities who have eaten here."
,,,,,"This storied deli is a overpriced tourist trap, but visit late to pick up your food if you don't mind spending $25 a pound for chopped liver which IS tasty. I've lived two blocks away for 30 years. Stay away on weekends."
,,,,,Have to say that the price is kinda high but never disappointed when coming here. So I guess you could say it's worth it but not for an everyday thing.
,,,,,"Whenever you're in NYC, one of the iconic food spots to visit is Katz. The place is always busy and the portion sizes are definitely worth the price. I ordered the pastrami hot sandwich and thank goodness I was able to share the sandwich with my wife. The sandwich was enormous!"
,,,,,"Each bite was full of flavor with each piece of meat being juicy and savory. There's nothing I can't stand more than a dry sandwich and this is anything but that. The experience was completed by washing it all down with Dr. Brown Cream Soda. The place might be a little too touristy for some, but the food is worth it in my opinion. Can't wait to go back and try the other sandwiches!"
,,,,,We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your first visit - we love making new fans. Drop by again soon and give our Reuben a try!
,,,,,Asian Perspective (Korean)
,,,,,Famous pastrami on rye
,,,,,"Meat (pastrami) is pretty salty, not gonna lie. But, it's super tender and falls apart so easily."
,,,,,Bread is a must because of how salty meat is.
,,,,,Mustard is a must too to counter saltiness. If you get togo ask for extra mustard.
,,,,,Don't reject the pickles! Must have. Removes saltiness from your palette.
,,,,,Also ask for plastic fork unless you wanna get messy!
,,,,,"Overall, gotta try it at least once. Meat is so tender it's crazy."
,,,,,That's it! Enjoy!
,,,,,I woke up craving a Reuben and no other deli would suffice.
,,,,,I see why this place is an NYC landmark and the legends are true lol
,,,,,More than happy to risk it all for a Katz's Deli Reuben sandwich!
,,,,,I was in & out in a matter of minutes!
,,,,,Can't wait to return!
,,,,,"This place is definitely a tourist destination, but it's not just for tourists. I'll be honest, walking in, it was a madhouse. They give you a ticket and tell you if you lose it, you're paying $50. I know it's to curb theft since you order at different counters, but I don't understand why they can't just get a better system."
,,,,,"We went up to the counter and my boyfriend and I ordered a pastrami on rye with mustard. The carver gave us a small dish of pastrami to try. Apparently this is a thing they do, but the carver was very cold, and I wasn't sure what he was trying to do."
,,,,,"I then tried to order a soft drink. I stood at this counter, and the employee barely acknowledged me, but when he did, he'd interrupt me to speak to others that came up behind me, and it took me completely aback."
,,,,,"The sandwich was close to $20 which is outrageously overpriced, but I was able to comfortable share it with my boyfriend. They also gave us both full and half-sour pickles. I usually don't spend more than $10 on a sandwich. It was really, really good, though, so I understand why it's so famous."
,,,,,"When you leave, you gotta hand in your ticket so that way they know what you ordered. Not sure if it's cash only, but it appeared that way and I just paid cash."
,,,,,"I'd probably go again, but their service and ordering system needs some serious work and needs to be brought into the 21st century."
,,,,,One of the Originals. Katz's Delicatessen is excellent. The meats on the sandwiches will melt in your mouth. The breads are always fresh. The pickles are tasty also.
,,,,,"Katz's not only has sandwiches, they have a variety of other dishes including fresh turkey, and of course soup. If your not in NYC, Katz's ships nationwide. "
,,,,,Still one of the best places to eat in NYC.
,,,,,"Matzo ball soup is perfect on a chilly day! The pastrami sandwich combo is delicious.  If you choose to go in, you'll almost always wait in a hefty line, but you can try any of the meats and the food is well worth it. I get it to go mostly, and it never disappoints.  A bit on the pricey side, but it really is quality.  The cheesecake is nothing special - save your appetite for the savory here!"
,,,,,"We're so glad that you enjoyed your experience! And if you ever looking to dodge the crowds, try dropping by at an off-peak hour: breakfast, between lunch/dinner or after the dinner rush. Hope to see you back again soon!"
,,,,,Do you like sandwiches? soup? general deli food? If you answered yes to any of these questions please come to Katz!! This is one of the places that truly does live up to the hype!! We had a pastrami and a roast beef sandwich with matzo ball soup and everything was delicious. My boyfriend claims it might just just have been the best sandwich of his life and we will definitely be going back to Katz!
,,,,,"While you may think ""oh I don't want to have to wait hours for a sandwich at this NYC hot spot"", if you come at the right time, the wait might only be like 5 minutes... (we came at 11:40 on a Sunday, right before the general lunch rush)... but even if the wait a few minutes more, it is worth it. The food is that good. Plus, the set up here is top notch and they make it so lines move fast. I will say, look online ahead of time at the menu and pick what you want since there are different lines for different items. "
,,,,,"Also, as mentioned, you get a ticket when you walk in and they write your order on it and you pay when you leave. Don't lose the ticket (bc you will have to pay a fee), but I also recommend bringing cash if you can for a quicker check out. They do take Credit Cards, but in a separate place in the back, not at the up front register to leave."

,,,,,The only classic deli left in New York City!!! 
,,,,,"Best corned beef , pastrami in the city! "
,,,,,"old time gruff waitstaff , takes you back in time!!!! "
,,,,,Love this place!!!!
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear you've enjoyed your meals here - our long-time fans are the backbone of our restaurant, and make our jobs so rewarding and fun. Hope to see you back again soon!"
,,,,,"Katz's deli. A staple in NYC. It has stood the test of time with its name and quality of food. If you want the best Pastrami Sandwich in the city Katz is hands down the spot. One mistake people make (unless you don't like sauerkraut, Swiss cheese, and Russian dressing) is getting the plain pastrami sandwich. When you go there you have to get there Rueben with Pastrami. I know tradition holds that corn beef should go on a Rueben which is understandable but the Thick Cut Pastrami at Katz is on another level. "
,,,,,"Outside of the Rueben with Pastrami, the corn beef is great just not my go to and the brisket is a hidden gem. "
,,,,,"Some cons - The waits are long, seating is tough, paying with a card is tedious, the Rueben is pricey but worth it"
,,,,,P.S. When you're at the glass watching them make your sandwich tip when they are looking and they tend to be a little more generous with the portions!
,,,,,"I go for the hot dogs... they ain't never got two things that match ketchup no mustard, sauerkraut no onions or vice versa. But the dawgs are good."
,,,,,A place that has menu options catering to your preferences on fat content is a place that cares about you. I get all my sandwiches lean but my family loves the flavor of the regular corned beef. 
,,,,,"Restaurant itself is very old school, of course because it's been there for generations. Very laid back, casual eatery. Expensive but worth it."
,,,,,"What more can be said about one of the most famous delicatessens in New York City?  I add my voice to the plethora of praise for this amazing place!  I've been there twice, and will return!  Tale of the tape:"
,,,,,"Pastrami Sandwich on Rye: the pastrami here is literally melt-in-your-mouth!  While your sandwich is being made they plop a few slices on a plate in front of you to sample, and you've never had pastrami like this before, I guarantee it . . .  Their secret?  Instead of taking 36 hours to cure the meat via pressure-injection (which is what we've all had elsewhere), their process takes 30 days.  The difference is stark, and absolutely amazing!  To say that their pastrami is moist, tender and juicy is nowhere near enough to describe it's incredible taste!  On rye with a little spicy brown mustard, you have an authentic New York treat!"
,,,,,Corned Beef Sandwich on Rye: just as amazing as their pastrami!
,,,,,"If you're in New York City, stop by Katz's for a little pastrami and corned beef on rye.  Come hungry, and leave happy!"
,,,,,We're so glad that you've enjoyed your visits here - our long-time fans are the backbone of our restaurant. Drop by again soon and give our Reuben a whirl!
,,,,,Forever a classic. As a bee Yorker I only really come when someone's visiting so it's just as special for me. Really recommend doing table service. You don't have to deal with lines and finding a table. Personal favs are the chopped liver and corned beef. And of course a chocolate egg cream.
,,,,,"Hate to do this, but it must be done. This place is the biggest tourist trap in NYC. Seriously. Decided to visit with a friend who was visiting from out of town and honestly wish I would have just taken him to a solid bodega. "
,,,,,"From rude staff, to a confusing ordering system - had to go to 5 people to figure out how the hell to order latkes - this place started out with negative stars in my mind. We split a Reuben and an order of latkes. Latkes were flavorless and the Reuben was not as massive or tasty as people have said in the past. I don't know if we got unlucky on an off night or what, but for $20 per sandwich I need it to be a sandwich of the Gods. "
,,,,,Advice - pass and go somewhere else.
,,,,,"We're sorry to hear that you had such a negative experience - we never want our customers to be anything less than thrilled with the quality of their sandwich, or our service. We thank you for your honest feedback and will look into the situation - please feel free to call and speak to a manager at any time."
,,,,,Yes!!! Most authentic deli in the five boroughs. Don't skip the pastrami or the french fries. Matzo ball soup is also a good pick.
,,,,,"Probably an unpopular opinion, but I didn't find these sandwiches to be any special AND plus the price for a given sandwich, I am likely just not coming back. It's 50 bucks for TWO sandwiches....what!??!?!"
,,,,,Got the fatty pastrami sandwich and the roast beef. 
,,,,,"True to it's name, the fatty pastrami sandwich was fatty. It was pretty good and they don't skimp out on the meat. The sandwich is the following. Bread + crapload of meat + bread. There's nothing else. They do give you some cucumbers and pickles on the side though. Did I enjoy this, yes. Would I pay 25 bucks again for it...no."
,,,,,"The roast beef was definitely one of the better roast beef sandwiches I've had. Not too dry, and great warm. "
,,,,,"Maybe it's just a ritual that people have to enjoy this place, but I thought it was a bit overrated. Make sure to eat the sandwiches warm though!"
,,,,,"If you find yourself craving a New York style deli sandwich and you happen to be in New York then you should already be on your way to Katz's. The line is out the door but the service is fast. The wait is absolutely worth it. If you don't believe me then you should listen to the old Jewish man next to me--he declared ""There's nothing like it! This is the best deli."" And he is absolutely right."

,,,,,iconic deli in les nyc
,,,,,"great sandwich, the line was long but definitely worth it "
,,,,,will come again
,,,,,Stopped here on my way to jersey. Take your yellow ticket and head in. I had the nicest staff member make my sandwich. It was huge!! The first bite and we all said mmmmm. It was good. $23 for pastrami $8 bucks for fries. Haven't been here in around 4 years and I have to say it still just as good!! I'm a New Yorker and we love Katz!
,,,,,"I have been going to Katz's deli for years. The sandwiches are the best in NYC. The quality stands out, as does the portion size. One of sandwiches can keep me fed all day, they are so big! I love that about Katz's deli! My favorited sandwich is the corned beef, Reuben style! My mouth waters just thinking about it! I have had bites of the pastrami sandwich when I have taken friends to the deli, but have never ordered it myself as I am faithful to the corned beef. Thank you Katz's!"
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear you've enjoyed your experiences here - our long time fans are the backbone of our restaurant, and they make our jobs so rewarding and fun. Hope to see you back again soon for another corned beef Reuben!"

,,,,,Iconic spot. A bit touristy but you need to check it out. Fantastic corned beef and pastrami
,,,,,"I returned to NYC after MUCH MUCH too long an absence. Several of my normal haunts are closed, so this trip I decided to walk to more offbeat locales. One of the places which immediately came up in planning was Katz's. I have never actually set foot in this deli before ... OOOHHHH what I've been missing. Don't get me wrong, it's somewhat intimidating. When you walk in and want to dine inside you have to share your data on a temperamental ipad (and have your temperature taken). Then they hand you a ticket and you go to a cutter (I didn't know that he was supposed to be tipped in cash, I tipped at the end - how embarrassing), and the cutter makes an incredible sandwich. From there, you have to go find your beverage.  All of which gets written on this ticket. They do NOT rush you, giving you time to enjoy your meal, the pickles and the surroundings. I cannot WAIT to go back."
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your first visit - there's nothing we love more than making new fans. And if you're ever craving a long distance pastrami fix, we do ship nationwide (with free two day shipping on orders over $100)! Hope to see you back again soon."
,,,,,"Katz's Delicatessen is a staple of NY and one of the most reviewed places in NY with 11,000+ reviews. From line to sitting down at the table was about 25m on a Friday afternoon at 2pm. Everyone who walks in is given a ticket, and you must return the ticket when you leave to get out whether you order or not. There are tables in the middle of the floor that are self serve- as in you get your food at the counter and find a place to sit or a section against the wall where you can have a waiter serve you. "
,,,,,"Lines are long but there are 7 cutter stations where they can slice the meat and make your sandwich/give you any of the food items you desire! 7 lines helps keep the wait reasonable. There are a few tables around the corner in the restaurant if it initially looks full, so keep your eye out! When you're at the cutter station, feel free to ask for samples of the various meats before deciding which one you want! Sandwiches are stacked very high with protein, so get ready for a mouthful. "
,,,,,"The pastrami was tender and very flavorful, and the corned beef is well flavored as well. If it's your first time I'd definitely recommend the pastrami sandwich with mustard on rye! I got the matzo ball soup as well but not sure what all the hype is about... perhaps I just don't appreciate matzo ball soup? All in all it's a great place to eat and I'd definitely come back."
,,,,,"One of the iconic deli restaurant in NYC since 1888. Upon entering the restaurant, you would receive a red ticket. "
,,,,,"We ordered pastrami, corn beef, potato Latke and matzo ball soup. Everything was good and we especially loved the pastrami sandwich, which had a combination of lean and fat meat. The pastrami was tender, fresh, savory, moist and enjoyable delicious. Corn beef was a little bit dry, but it was still good. I highly recommend to get the pastrami instead of the corn beef. "
,,,,,"The sandwiches were good size and it came along with pickles. There are lots of tables in the back near the bathroom. It is a little expensive and one sandwich costs about 24 dollars, but it is worth. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. It is great spot to get pastrami sandwich."
,,,,,delicious food. very expensive!!! long lines in the summer . a must have as a treat to yourself
,,,,,Don't love the food here (my parents did) but the place itself is pretty cool and popular
,,,,,"Katz's is a must! specially if you're in NY for the first time. It's a little pricey but the sandwiches are HUGE and loaded with meat so understandable. The Pastrami on Rye with Swiss, a Philly and the Potato Salad is a must! Don't forget to tip your chef!"
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,Hands down! Pastrami Sandwich on rye is unmatched. Loved the meat until the last bite. Worth the lines and the wait!
,,,,,What is there to say about Katz's?
,,,,,"We came in on a Monday midday (Presidents' Day, so maybe more of a crowd than a typical Monday?) and there was some crowd but not crazy packed. We were able to quickly walk up to one of the cutters, find a table, and begin eating. "
,,,,,"We ordered a pastrami Reuben, a corned beef sandwich (with sauerkraut), and a brisket sandwich (with mustard and Swiss). Of course, all on rye. "
,,,,,"The sandwiches are huge, and the meats are delicious. The $17-25 price tag on these sandwiches feels like a small price to pay when you consider both the quality and the quantity of the meat. "
,,,,,"We each ate half of our sandwich, and brought the other halves home (dinner!). "
,,,,,"When you walk in, each person is handed a ticket, which you must hold onto. When you order, they write the price of your meal on the ticket so you can pay on your way out (And if you lose it, they charge you $50. So don't)"
,,,,,"The food is, of course, delicious and is well worth the price."
,,,,,We're so glad that you enjoyed your first visit! Hope to see you back again soon for another pastrami and brisket fix.
,,,,,"I mean... it really goes without saying, this place is worth the hype and wait. Order the pastrami corned beef combo and your life will be forever altered."
,,,,,It was great ! The portions are extreme! Very heart and oily in a good way! I honestly was laziness on how real pastrami can taste
,,,,,"Expensive but good. Paid almost $30 for a pastrami on rye but it was delicious. Best sandwich in the city. Regulations sucked because of Covid so I had to take it to go, but it was seriously the best pastrami of my life."
,,,,,"This is my first time going here since many years ago and it is as great as I remember it! I was lucky on a Monday night because there wasn't a line. The dine in area was also not packed. Weekends here are insane! Anyway, you get a ticket as you go in so you can present it to the cutters who will take your order. They will mark your order on that ticket. Also take care of that ticket because you will need to present this on your way out. For that recent visit, I got a pastrami sandwich. I love that they give you a pretty good amount of sample slice to munch on. The pastrami was so delicious and savory. I got a side of pickle to-go."
,,,,,The service was great that evening. The cutter was kind. I will come back!
,,,,,Omg I haven't been here sooo long. Everything is nice and protected in here. They checked temperatures and all.  Pastrami sandwiches are the best to me....
,,,,,Food it always PHENOMENAL. 
,,,,,I order the Pastrami every single time it can EASILY be shared!
,,,,,Potato knish any any of their soups are also always great accompaniments.
,,,,,I mean... its Katzs. Get it at least once in your life. Eat a mountain of meat. Live a little.
,,,,,Katz's deli - since 1888. And mostly unchanged since my childhood visits. 
,,,,,"So the line was a full block long! Fortunately, the weather was terrific for a mid-winter day, and we had a nice time chatting with those on line with us."
,,,,,"When you enter, you get a ticket - and you cannot leave without one, so be careful! Your food and drink costs are handwritten on your ticket by the ""Cutter"" and drink station folks, and you can pay cash at the exit or credit in the back. Everything moves fairly quickly, so we were sitting down within 45 minutes of our arrival at the end of the line. "
,,,,,"Once in you head to your random ""Cutter"" sandwich station (seven choices) or to the hot dog/burger/knish/latke line, unless you want table service- on this day an estimated 1/2 hour wait."
,,,,,"This was a first for my wife, so the wait was worth it for me to watch her sample the fresh sliced pastrami Cutter #5 placed on the counter as he prepared our pastrami on rye ($22.45), along with a generous helping of kosher dill pickles and a monstrous mound of cole slaw ($1.00). The oh my god was expected..."
,,,,,We moved on from the sandwich line to open seating grabbing a black cherry and a coke on the way ($5.90) 
,,,,,"In summary the sandwich was magnificent- the best pastrami sandwich on earth, IMHO. "
,,,,,Tipping your cutter is customary...so figure $75 all in for two at this venerable NYC deli. 
,,,,,Put it on your bucket list.
,,,,,"We're so glad that you've enjoyed your experiences here - our long time fans are the backbone of our restaurant, and make our jobs truly rewarding and fun. Hope to see you guys back again soon for another pastrami fix!"
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,"So glad we made the trek to Katz's Delicatessen. I love me a good pastrami sandwich.. seriously is probably my favorite type of sandwich and there aren't too many places in Seattle that serve it (or they do but they give you a measly 2 slices which isn't enough). Yes, the sandwiches are $25 but there's no way you'll be able to finish the whole thing (I did the ""open face sandwich method"" with half a sandwich) and I was full. Even my friend's husband (who is very picky) was amazed and finished the other half of the sandwich and raved about how good I was. We came here during the slow time which is great, it is confusing for your first time coming here but we figured it out together."
,,,,,The ambience is awesome. The food is just aite.
,,,,,After a 45 minute wait (lost track bc I was so hangry) Katz without a doubt lived up to it's hype + some! The pastrami was probably the best pastrami i have ever feasted in. 
,,,,,"We got there around 11 on the Sunday following Xmas and man was it packed. Wall to wall ppl waiting in ridiculously long lines. The line system they put in place was a bit chaotic, but we did eventually make it up to the counter. The gentlemen taking our order provided us with corn beef and brisket samples (yum). He recommended we try the two different types of, pastrami and matzo-ball soup."
,,,,,We got our order and all I can is: I have never in my 37.5  years been wowed by a deli before (the only way to describe the feeling) Definitely worth the long lines!
,,,,,"Oy vey, do I bother exercising my fingers to type this review since there's already 10K+ and it's an institution to all.... well here I go anyway:"
,,,,,"Was over the moon excited to try this classic spot, referenced in movies & tv shows galore. I'm a Jew, so the bar is set high when it comes to classic delicatessen. Katz was a disappointment to say the least. "
,,,,,"Very thickly sliced meats... I think it's safe to say most who eat sandwiches prefer it on the thinly sliced side. They used a butcher knife, no slicing machine in sight. I respect that. I ordered pastrami on rye with mustard and coleslaw. I have had MUCH tastier, saltier pastrami...for example Carnegie Deli (RIP) and the best, Harold's in NJ. Was a bit on the fatty side. Bread was not fresh, granted it was late. Matzo ball soup wasn't half bad--tasty broth, fluffy ball...obviously still not Grandma's. Half sour & sour pickles provided, no complaints. Decent sized portions but pretty dang pricy."
,,,,,"Overall, the service at Katz was very rude (you say typical NYC charm, but I beg to differ). It's cafeteria order style late night, you get a ticket. To pay by credit card it is all the way in the back, cash up front only. Wall bombarded with celebrity photos who have visited. Old, dingy charm interior maintained. An OK meal, especially to those who don't eat Jew food often...but I personally would not make the trek to the village again for it."
,,,,,"This place is a New York classic. Love the sandwiches, could eat the hot pastrami every day. The matzo ball soup is one of the best I've had in a long time- just like grandma's!"
,,,,,"Wow, my Pastrami and Swiss was absolutely fantastic! Love how they give you a sample of the meat while they are making your sandwich. Also tried the Katz IPA, was super happy I got it too! My buddy got the Corned Beef Sandwich, neither of us really liked it, I sampled it and It was too fatty. He ate Half of his corned beef and went back and got a Pastrami Sandwich! They are just that good. But then the bill, 2 waters, 1 beer and 3 sandwiches with tip, over $100... yikes. But I'd pay $22 for that Pastrami sandwich once or twice a year, It is that good!"
,,,,,"So what can one say that 10,000+ reviews have not? Well that is a tough one as I can really only piggyback on many other reviews, but I am proud to review this age old spot!"
,,,,,"So why not start with the negatives, hence the less than perfect rating. Due to its popularity expect huge lines of people all day and night as it is quite hectic. Be prepared to hold onto this odd and confusing ticket that is taken from you and given back from employees on several occasions. Do NOT lose the ticket or you are in deep trouble, just ask the security guard at the door, they take it very serious. Either way, it basically just notes if you paid and what you ordered. Seating can be tough, so forget about having a table to yourself as you will be sharing it Hong Kong style. Lastly, be prepared to order as the staff really just want to keep the line moving versus someone holding it up, I mean we all come for the pastrami and matzo though. "
,,,,,"Okay negatives out of the way! I was here for the famous pastrami and matzo ball soup (Sadly I did not get to order the matzo though!). After a semi short wait I got my enormous serving of pastrami on rye, hence why I opted for just the sandwich. Luckily found a spot next to a very kind party, but I was so zoned into the monstrosity of a sandwich that was in front of me, that I barely got to talk to them. Sandwich notes: juicy, tender, flavorful, filling, I mean what could one ask more of? Was it the best I had ever eaten, that is a tough one as Langers in Los Angeles serves up a pretty tasty pastrami as well, but it was darn good though! I am sure you know about the pricing, which is not surprising, but honestly fit the bill with how much meat you are served (Over $23 for the sandwich). "
,,,,,"To sum it up, I am with the many locals, save Katz for a special occasion or one time event as it is quite hectic and always a long jaunt followed by a wait for some grub."
,,,,,Just took home pastrami corned beef and chopped liver .Hands down the best deli in New York . The pastrami is something out of this world . During this pandemic all I hear from most business. Is excuses about the product . Thank you Katz's deli for no excuse fabulous food
,,,,,I had lunch in my car last week Pastrami on rye . Went way out of way to get it . The end of the story is this . I have NEVER had a pastrami sandwich that comes close to this . Absolutely fabulous worth the trip .
,,,,,I look forward to going there . Their pastrami sandwich is out of this world . Not the most luxurious setting and sometimes the wait is a issue but worth the wait
,,,,,I look forward to going there . Their pastrami sandwich is out of this world . Not the most luxurious setting and sometimes the wait is a issue but worth the wait .

,,,,,"It just tasted sooooooooooo good!!!! Specially when the cutters give you that pieces right there on a plate, yummmmm. Don't be shy and take al in. "
,,,,,**Tip - Keep your ticket!!!!
,,,,,"This one lives up to the hype, best F'ing pastrami sandwich piled high with meat just the right amount of mustard and two varieties of pickles.  A mid-day all-day eats if you ask me.  I ordered a half sandwich and that was more than enough for me. I went there on a Wednesday, and walked there and back to burn off all the deliciousness.  This sandwich is a treat, I can't imagine eating it every day. I arrived around 315pm and there was a line, it moved fast and I was in by 330pm, got my ticket and waited to be called to the counter.  Make sure to have cash on hand to tip the cutter!! They do take credit cards but it's good to tip the person actually making your sandwich.   Everyone I encountered was very friendly, and helpful. The place runs well, is organized, clean, etc.  I placed my order, received a tasting of the pastrami (unexpected and YUM).  I took my half sandwich and pickles and looked for a seat to enjoy.  And great it was! I was starving by the time I walked there and finishing up an 18hr fast and glad this was my first meal of the day.  Boy, was it good! juicy, well seasoned, and what dreams are made of! tasty food, a good atmosphere, and A real NY experience.  I'm glad I tried it, and you should too."

,,,,,"One late night, one of my friends suggested we all go here to grab something to eat. It was like after 2 in the morning and this place was jammed packed. I always remember passing here as a little girl when my aunt lived in the city but never went inside."
,,,,,"You get a ticket as you enter and you stand on line for one of the many butchers to prepare your meal. It was different and interesting. I don't even remember the orders we made but I know my sandwich was a turkey sandwich. One of my friends treated me to it since it was my first time having it and said if I didn't like it at least I didn't pay for it lol. It was pricey too, like $24 for that sandwich."
,,,,,"I ate half of my sandwich when I got home and saved the other piece for the next day. As seen in the pic, there was a piece of pastrami that got mixed into my sandwich (I was a little annoyed by that). It was a good sandwich but I had better from my local corner store deli. "
,,,,,"If I'm ever nearby in the city looking for a late night sandwich, I might consider returning. Definitely glad I experienced it though."
,,,,,"the food is incredible but ........ Whenever I have to wait in a long line I put on ""Minute by Minute"" in my headphones. That helps me wait it out, gives me perspective. You can also measure how long the wait is by how many repeats (PS the song is 3:28). Katz was three repeats and midway into the 4th listen before even ordering, if you get my drift"
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear that you've enjoyed your meals here! Though we do often serve quite a full house, you can sometimes try dodging the crowd by dropping by at an off-peak hour: breakfast, between lunch/dinner, or after the dinner rush. Hope to see you back again soon!"
,,,,,The Best Pastrami I travel from the Long Island to eat here .........
,,,,,Overrated tourist trap. I am amazed people are stupid enough to pay $25 for a sandwich. This place is nothing special. The Pastrami you can get anywhere. The only difference I noticed is they hand cut it here thick. Otherwise its typical deli meat.
,,,,,I guess the pandemic slowed everybody down their sandwiches are definitely not the same the meat is not even the same quality it was before can you please bring back the old cat's deli
,,,,,"There is nothing you really have to say for this place. YOU HAVE TO GO. Whether you're visiting or a New York local, Katz's is a staple and a monument. The food is just AMAZING. Period."
,,,,,"This review is based on the ordering and serving system and a single order of matzo ball soup.  Totally unfair.  I had the soup 20something years ago after a late night drinking bout and liked it; sober as a judge in broad daylight, I felt it it had not aged well.  The broth tasted out of a box.  I guess the carrots were legit and the matzo ball was softer than I remember (that's a good thing), but it did cost me $8.  Again this review isn't necessarily fair but while I'm here just let me criticize the payment method.  It was totally confusing!  I'm aware that Katz's is a classic but wish they could simplify.  There were signs telling you where to go based on what you wanted to order but then it seemed like you didn't necessarily have to go to any of those places and then there was a line for credit card pay and another separate line for cash I guess and when I tried to pay my ticket the guy said you eat first and then pay.  I'm just used to paying before I eat in the typical cafeteria setup, but it looks like Katz's gets to do it the way they've always done it and be all delightfully idiosyncratic but it was just stressful for me and I lived in the city for 5 years.  Ok, enough complaints.  I don't know when I'll go back but when I do, I'll actually get a sandwich and some pickles so I can make a real judgement."
,,,,,"The store is huge so finding a seat is not that difficult, though it can be busy. I came on a rainy Saturday morning, around 11 am. When you enter, there's a person by the door that gives you a ticket. DO NOT LOOSE THIS TICKET or it will cost you a whooping $50. It's your ticket to order food/receipt and ticket out the door. After you get your ticket, there are multiple lines to stand in and order, so just pick the shortest one. The guys behind the counter were very efficient and fast so it did not take long to order."
,,,,,"I ordered the pastrami sandwich on rye with melted cheese and mustard and it comes with a side of cucumbers and pickles. I thought it was weird but it complimented the sandwich so well! I am not a big fan of pastrami but boy, this sandwich easily changed my mind. The meat was so soft, juicy, and melts in your mouth. The bread was SO soft (it did not look good when I was looking at yelp photos)! This sandwich is huge, so it can be shared, and a good $26! Very expensive for a sandwich, but it is a quality sandwich!"
,,,,,"Even though it's only takeout and delivery, everything was still amazing! i got the pastrami with mustard and mayo on rye, matzoh ball soup and bread pudding. Hands down the best deli food around. If you go to New York you have to visit!"
,,,,,"Katz Delicatessen is so much bigger than I thought it would be. There are people everywhere, and you walk into organized chaos. People ordering at the counter on one side. Waitered service on the other. We were seated immediately and got a true New York experience. Our water was a character. The food was outstanding. Definitely worth coming in for a meal. It's an experience. It's also the Deli where When Harry met Sally was filmed. One last thing. Don't lose the pink ticket they hand you when you enter. There's an extra charge If you do"

,,,,,Pastrami on rye is to die for ! It's cafeteria style and pay after you eat . These guys have kept the old time values and feel to the place. Keep it up !
,,,,,"This was the absolute best sandwich I have ever had in my life. I split the pastrami sandwich with a friend and even just half was incredibly filling. The meat had an incredibly soft, tender texture that melted in your mouth like butter. It was the best tasting beef I've ever experienced and the mustard sauce was great as well. Even their pickles were good. Be warned though, this sandwich will ruin all other sandwiches for you. Although the sandwich is very expensive at more than $20, it was more than worth it given the size and amazing taste. Highly, highly recommend this place."
,,,,,This review is not about the food it's about the door guy. I've been going to Katz's since I was little and have always been treated nicely and the food has always been consistent. The door guy is so nasty and was so disrespectful to me and my friends. Very disappointed Amd made the experience bad and left a bad taste in my mouth now about Katz's.
,,,,,We're so sorry that you had such a negative experience. The treatment you received should never be the case - we will take your feedback to heart and address it. Please feel free to call and speak to a manager any time.
,,,,,Consistently delicious pastrami sandwich. Quick service. Atmosphere is casual and cool. Iconic spot!
,,,,,"Best Ruben sandwich EVER, ANYWHERE!!"
,,,,,"This was by far, withhold a doubt, the best deli I've ever experienced in my entire life!"
,,,,,I'll have what she''s having!!!
,,,,,Truly ORGASMMIC experience !
,,,,,Hands down some of the best  pastrami I've had and the most expensive. I love how they cut several pieces for customers to have a taste test without you asking. Not sure if I was lucky or the fact Covid still here either way the line wasn't long. Waited outside for a few minutes and even inside everything moved along rather quickly. In and out 20-30 minutes top. Parking wasn't an issue but I can definitely see how it could be for some people.
,,,,,We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your first visit - we love making new fans. Hope to see you back again soon for another pastrami fix!
,,,,,"I love this place so so so so so much!  I keep coming back and this place has been here forever and a day!  This is a true NY classic.  It may look like a tourist trap, but it is not.  It is filled with locals, like me, that love their food because the taste and quality is consistent.  This is how you run a restaurant, by keep your customer fan base by continuing to serve the same delicious food that first got you famous.  A lot of places that often become famous often change their recipes and their quality goes down.  Katz is thankfully not like that.  "
,,,,,"Yes, this place is super packed and crowded.  It may look intimidating when you walk in, but the line goes quick.  Definitely highly recommend checking this place out if you like this type of food.  It is well worth the price.  Your tummy will be happy."
,,,,,"I have lived in new york for a little over a year now, and I would often visit when i lived in boston. today was the first time I had myself a pastrami sandwich from katz's and it has inspired me to write this haiku(?):"
,,,,,why have I waited
,,,,,"so long? my tongue, betrayed."
,,,,,I am in heaven.
,,,,,*chef's kiss*
,,,,,----------------
,,,,,(I also met the nicest server because he saw how lost I was lmao. thank you to whoever you were! I appreciate your kindness and for helping me out :) )
,,,,,I can't believe I forgot to rate Katz's when I was in NYC...I have seen this place on all sorts of TV food shows and like other reviewers was somewhat skeptical of the hype around it. I have been burned a few times as I ventured out with excitement to eat at these places that have had a bunch of hype. Well Katz's deli lives up to everything and I mean everything...this place is totally legit and the food is amazing. The forewarning I would give is either come super hungry or share something and be patient. The day we were here we waited for 1.5 hours just to get in and it was worth every second. The thing also about this place is they are machines at moving volumes of people through the restaurant and everyone was super friendly. 
,,,,,The day in question our family should've read how really big the food is here because the TV just doesn't give it justice. My pastrami sandwich was so big I had to actually take meat off the sandwich just to get my mouth around it. Not that I let any go to waste or any that my wife took off hers either. The meat despite they move volumes through here was/is so delicious!  Our mistake was ordering sides to accompany our sandwiches because they only got a nibble based on the sandwich size. All in all I would highly suggest going here and going through the experience. The service is A+ and the food A++++.
,,,,,"What more can you say about this place but this is meat heaven...we walked up and were probably 25-30 people deep in line outside the restaurant and at first a little disappointment set in at the wait time, but surprising they turn the tables here really quick and we only waited outside for 15 mins to get inside...once inside you are directed what meat carver to go to. I personally love the simple menu on meat selections, but the wife and chose to split the pastrami and brisket sandwich. Personally this was way too much food but I wasn't willing to pass up on the opportunity to get into a meat coma. Well Katz did not disappoint in any way... This was personally the best pastrami sandwich I have ever had and the spicy mustard they put on their sandwiches really hit the spot...I have had a lot of brisket and a lot of pastrami and nothing holds a candle to Katz. The other thing I appreciated was the great service and no nonsense of the employees...when you are putting as many people through a place as this one does they really have it figured out. "

,,,,,Best rubin and pastrami sandwich ever. This is one place I go over and over. Love the service and people there. It's a must for nyc.
,,,,,A-MA-ZING! 
,,,,,"This is a staple when visiting NYC, though I would HIGHLY recommend a midweek visit to avoid the line around the corner!  Katz's has been an institution since 1888, if you can believe that!  "
,,,,,"We arrived at 1:30 on Saturday afternoon, and found ourselves in line 1/2 way down Houston, but boy the wait is worth it. "
,,,,,"You have 2 options - table service or order your own at the counters & find a table. We opted for #, given then 30-35 minute wait quoted for a table. "
,,,,,"The lines are a bit chaotic, but we spread out to see who would wind up belly up to the carver 1st...... "
,,,,,"All meat is carved to order, and portions are beyond generous.  Don't forget to tip your carver & ask for extra pickles (I prefer the dill to the 1/2 dill) "
,,,,,"Fries, cole slaw, and other sides are ordered at another counter, along with drinks.  "
,,,,,"One thing to ALWAYS remember.... DO NOT lose your ticket.  Everyone who walks in gets a ticket, whether you eat or not..... they will charge you $50 if you lose it!!!"
,,,,,AND STILL the best pastrami I have ever had. But the cheatcode is to get their chicken liver pate. It is the bomb dot com! 
,,,,,Servers still give you a sample. 
,,,,,They still have Dr Brown's sodas.

,,,,,"Good but pricey,$20 fora sandwich $8 for fries me and my son split the food .everyone recommended katz. It was only a one time thing just to say we ate there, it was good though!"
,,,,,"Historic mainstay for pastrami on rye . My grandpa talked about this place for years to me before he died. I finally went after he died to remember him by it, and now I always go . Cheers to my grandpa Nick Mazzariello.... Love you pop...... you were right, the pastrami on rye is the best"
,,,,,"Katz is a no go after 3 strikes. They charge extra if you want your meat sliced   thin. I purchased sandwiches from Katz on three different times. I requested the cut of the meat near the fat part as it would be juicy not dry. When l got the sandwich home it was all fat not cut thin which I paid for. The next time l went to Katz l order the pastrami sandwich when l got that sandwich home l found the meat was cut in such a way that l was chewing gobs of gristle and fat l couldn't chew or swallow and 70 % of the sandwich had to be up chucked because it was cut too thick and couldn't be digested it was thrown away. Today ,12/13/21 I 0rdered a pastrami sandwich sliced thin and the server fixing my sandwich said he couldn't slice the meat any thinner. He cut thick slices; he gave me a sample slices which l approved. When l got home l began eating the sandwich and again there was gobs of gristle and fat. 3 strikes"
,,,,,My favorite food on earth. You have to get the hot pastrami on rye. The ordering process is a little hectic and stressful but you get used to it. Don't forget an egg cream.
,,,,,"The crazy part is I'm giving them a 5 star review after over an hour wait but as a fellow New Yorker I know that is average for the amazingness that is Katz. So my grandmother also from New York came to visit from down south and the first 3 things she said she wanted sushi, pork buns from China town and Katz. So what she wants she got. We got to Katz and saw the line down the block so we decided to order on their website which honestly was the best idea. We had to wait a little over an hour to pick it up but that was fine with us. We ordered 4 pastrami sandwiches I think they were around $23, knishes, dr.browns black Cherry soda and ofcourse extra of the best pickles ever. Honestly sad to say I haven't had a Katz pastrami sandwich in about 10 years and it was everything I remembered it to be. Nice thick slices of tender well seasoned pastrami stacked on rye with nothing but mustard omg amazing. You can't have a pastrami sandwich without Katz half sours and a black Cherry dr. Brown's. The knish didn't make the ovaries but my grandmother loved every bit of it. It was so nostalgic thinking of my childhood when they cost half the price and my family made it almost a once every month or 2 outing. As everything in ny is changing with the times it was great to see Katz remaining the same!"
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear you've enjoyed your meals here - our long-time fans are the backbone of our restaurant, and make our jobs so rewarding and so fun. Hope to see you back again next time you're in the neighborhood!"
,,,,,"This will probably be blasphemy to New Yorkers but try the pastrami sandwich at Manny's in Chicago. The meat has a little more fat, flavor, and tender. I can't describe it but the rye bread is also better. Katz rye bread felt relatively more bland. "
,,,,,"With that said, comparison aside, Katz's pastrami with mustard on rye lived up to the hype for me."
,,,,,"A landmark deli from films such as When Harry Met Sally, and probably even more iconic for the actual sandwiches because they're that good."
,,,,,"They use a unique numbering and payment system,  but once you see how busy the place gets, you understand why. There is both counter and table service, but I've only gone via counter to make sure I wasn't waiting too long. I can recommend all of the corned beef, pastrami, and Reuben sandwich variations. They're phenomenal and pack as much meat as you will probably ever see on a single deli sandwich."

,,,,,"NY classic. Knishes, hot dogs, matzah ball soup, and of course the pastrami. Must eat here if you're in the neighborhood"
,,,,,O. M. G. As good as I remember. Haven't been here in 10 years. This is the perfect spot to go to when you are going to splurge and indulge in a yummy pastrami sandwich. The sandwiches are huge and stacked with pastrami. You pretty much have to disassemble the sandwich a little to eat it is stacked so high. A must share. We ordered the fries to share as well.  The pastrami literally melts in your mouth. I'm literally craving it as I think about it. 
,,,,,The have an order system in place where you have to order yourself and find a seat or you are seated and waited on. It's a little confusing and it is always mobbed. It's TOTALLY worth it. 
,,,,,This legendary gem is a must try. You will not be disappointed.
,,,,,We're so glad you enjoyed your first visit back - our long time fans are the backbone of our store and make our jobs so fun and rewarding. Hope to see you back again soon!
,,,,,My parents patronized Katz for years!! Every time I come home I must get a sandwich! It's easy enough for two more sandwiches!
,,,,,The best corned beef.  Get extra bread and bread the sandwich down into 3 sandwiches.  A bargain!  Prepare for a sleep coma if you dare eat one yourself.
,,,,,Amazing smoked meat sandwich! I go every time i visit New York.  Totally recommended!
,,,,,"I and some friends were looking for somewhere to get a meal after a night of dancing. We happened to be near Katz deli, which we all wanted to try. "
,,,,,"You'll be handed a ticket as you walk in. As everybody else has said, do noooot lose your ticket. There are signs everywhere and they say they'll charge you a minimum of $50. Even if you decide not to order, just keep it to give back to them when you walk out."
,,,,,"Walk up to a counter and place an order. It'll be chaotic, but stand in something that looks like a line, and you will be fine. Depending on what you want, you may have to go to different counters. You have the option to try out the meats for sandwiches, which we did - cornbeef and pastrami. We both chose pastrami and decided to split it, since the sandwiches are large. It took a few minutes to get our order. Grab seats in the back, where it's less crowded and closer to the water (y'all gonna need it)."
,,,,,"The pastrami sandwich was bomb! Good flavor, maybe a little bit on the fattier side, but still yummy. Half a sandwich was more than enough for me. Only thing is, it can get pretty expensive - it's a smooth $18 + 9% tax for a sandwich and a few pickles. This is very much a once-in-while, treat yo self deal. Loved it, definitely coming back!"
,,,,,Side note: we had a friend in the group who keeps Kosher and wanted to check if this place was; it's not. Just a heads-up.
,,,,,"It was alright. The pastrami is really good. Its tasty for sure. I just don't think it was worth the money, or the wait and lack of seating in the place. The place is a total zoo when its busy. Had to try it once, but I won't go back."
,,,,,"If there were more stars I would give them. I am still sitting in the restaurant. Food is outstanding the employees are so helpful if you've never been here they're very very kind. I highly highly highly suggest you come here if you come to New York for a destination. You will not be disappointed. It's much more food than you think, so either split it or plan on leftovers. I live in Detroit and I will definitely order and have it delivered"
,,,,,"I got a take out rueben with pastrami and it was perfect. Not only was is piled high with delicious world famous pastrami they packaged and made the Togo experience perfect. I had everything in the bag, mayo, mustard, extra thousand island, ketchup and two types of pickles. We also got the fries, which if you love steak fries these are perfect crispy outside and creamy on the inside. A must if you're In the area but I would recommend get a Togo order because the lines are long."
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your meal - we strive to serve up the best sandwich each and every time! And though we do often serve quite a packed house, if you want to dodge the rush you could try dropping by at an off-peak time - breakfast and the hours between lunch and dinner tend to be calmer. Come by again soon!"
,,,,,"Fantastic as always. Pastrami on Rye a side of Latkas, and a Dr. Brown root beer, what else on the planet more would you need? They handled the lines during COVID perfectly, all of the staff is extremely friendly and accommodating, you'd expect them to be grumpy but they probably make too much money to have any resentment. That's a big deal to me is a friendly staff and these guys are cloud 9 level nice people. "
,,,,,"Anyways, my little review is redundant to this establishment but just had to comment on the quality, it has never changed, they are always leading the way. "

,,,,,"Katz's is definitely an iconic spot in NYC and is so well known for their pastrami. There's usually a huge line so either come really early before the crowd gets there or come really late when it's way past dinner time. I came really late for a late night option and didn't have to wait at all. The cutters aren't too friendly, actually depends on who you are. I had a cutter who was friendly to the customer in front of me but was indifferent towards me."
,,,,,"Once you walk in, each person is handed a ticket regardless if you plan to order or not. Make sure you do not lose your ticket since it's your way out too. Then you go up to any cutter station and order from the cutter. They would give you a small sample of the meat that you chose while you wait and then write the price on the ticket. There's a separate counter for ordering fries. After finishing your meal, you exit by handing in your ticket and paying."
,,,,,I tried the famous Katz's pastrami on rye and added swiss cheese. The pastrami was absolutely delicious. It was so tender and practically melted in my mouth. The mustard that they have on the table adds a nice contrast of flavor to the meat. The cheese was placed in between the cuts of pastrami which made it melt a little and tasted great. The bread was also soft and soaks up the juices from the pastrami but doesn't get soggy. They also give you 2 types of pickles; one is definitely more pickled than the other but the sourness and crunch factor is necessary.
,,,,,I definitely think that it's a must try spot since the meat was so delicious but it is definitely pricey. Be prepared to spend at least $25 on one sandwich.
,,,,,We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your meal - drop by again soon and give our Reuben a try!
,,,,,"Have been here twice both times I've visited the city. It is a must do for anyone traveling to the city. I always get pastrami on rye with mustard and if you'd like ask for the fatty pastrami it is very good. The establishment has a deep history as you may recall it was also from the movie when Harry met sally and known for the line ""I'll have what she's having."" If you don't come for the food come just to say you went to Katz's Deli."
,,,,,"I had the pastrami sandwich on rye bread for $22. I paid an extra $2 for tomato and lettuce. The sandwich is known for being really tall and packed with meat. You could pay an extra $2 for lean meat only or for extra meat. One sandwich can definitely feed two people. It came with 6 pickles or so in two varieties. It came with a side of deli mustard with a nice wooden spreading spoon. I ordered off of GrubHub and delivery was very quick. I liked how tender and moist the meat was. I also enjoyed the thin slices and layering. The bread was just okay. It fell apart but I liked how it wasn't tough.  This place has been around for over 100 years and is famous because of its long history and feature in films like ""When Harry Met Sally."" They have a ticket system. With Yelp, you can order your ticket ahead of time."
,,,,,"We tried pastrami sandwich, reuben sandwich and Reuben with pastrami. Among three of them, reuben with pastrami is the best one. Can't wait to visit Katz's Deli again. This place is heaven!"
,,,,,We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your first visit - we love making new fans. Hope to see you back again soon for another Reuben fix!
,,,,,"Hands down the best pastrami sandwich I ever had! The service was top notch. The guys behind the counter were a riot and very courteous. When I mentioned I had stopped by Katz to my boss who is NY native, he quickly became excited and recalled his own experiences when he used to live in NY. Couldn't be happier that I stopped by and just utter disappointed that nothing comes close to Katz back home in California!"
,,,,,"The food definitely lives up to the hype and it was delicious! The overall experience was a bit overwhelming, and I feel like they could be more clear about how to order and pay. It was also fairly pricey but the portions were large."
,,,,,I was very skeptical about corned beef but going to Katz's proved my skepticism to be misplaced. Their corned beef definitely lived up to the hype!
,,,,,"Best pastrami i've ever had. The place is not fancy like other restaurants and sometimes it gets too crowded. But if you want to taste the best pastrami in NYC, then come here."
,,,,,"I imagine this is the quintessential New York experience, and people would eat here even if the food was mediocre.  But it's not. The ordering and paying process is unnecessarily complicated, but it seems to have developed over years, and I suppose it's part of the experience.  "
,,,,,"I can't say the Reuben is the best Reuben I'd ever had, but I can say that the meat on the sandwich - the corned beef - is the best corned beef I've ever had.  It just falls apart at the touch. I wish there were more dressing on the sandwich.  I was glad I didn't order a Pastrami because the only kind of mustard they have on the table is contaminated by horseradish.  "
,,,,,The best deal seems to be the half sandwich and soup.  The matzo ball soup is amazing which is a good thing because I couldn't figure out how to order a drink; the broth was the only liquid I had until I spotted the glasses and water against the back wall on my way back from the restroom.
,,,,,"So a lot of friends have recommended this place as it was  supposed to be the standard pastrami sandwich place in New York. When my friend and I went late at night, the place wasn't too crowded but there was still a bit of a wait. We got a ticket and you go in and order what you want, and they mark the ticket and you pay when you leave. Don't lose it!"
,,,,,"We ended up getting the pastrami sandwich. It came on rye bread with mustard and pickles. The pastrami itself was delicious, it was a great quality meat with good flavors and taste. The bread wasn't all that good and I kind of wish it was more heated. You get two pickles, one that has been deeply brined and one that is just barley pickled."
,,,,,"While the meat was good, at like $24 per sandwich, it was quite pricey for what you got. And it didn't taste like"
,,,,,it deserved to be in that price range. Overall an okay choice.

,,,,,"I don't think Katz's has the best pastrami sandwich, that title belongs to Langer's in LA. But given that this place is a NY institution and where they filled When Harry Met Sally, it's a must go to place in NYC."
,,,,,"Katz's Delicatessen...boy oh boy what a place...I will be sleeping for dinner for the rest of the week because I payed every last penny I had for a sandwich, but boy was it more than just a sandwich...with every single bite I felt like I was being transported to Flavortown, USA, riding shotgun to none other than the Mayor himself...who am I kidding, that may have been the drugs talking, but nonetheless, great sandwich. 5 stars!"
,,,,,"Have known about Katz's for years & years but just never been, was in the City the other night for a Girl's weekend and decided, F*** It, lets go! "
,,,,,"Have actually never been down here as often as I spend time uptown and on the West Side, Need to come down here more often! "
,,,,,"Went at like 1am, had a plan to only get 1 sandwich, as we had just left dinner and already had Pizza and 3 other things in the car to eat, this weekend truly was a Foodie weekend! "
,,,,,"Took our ticket and was instantly like WTF do we do?? Total Tourist status, walked over to counter, had the best cutter, he walked us through the process and helped us out. Got our sandwich and then some extra pickles & headed out (not before using the bathroom - THANK GOD) "
,,,,,"As we walked through we were bummed we didnt have dinner here, there were soo many things that looked totally delish. "
,,,,,"Got just a Pastrami, and OMG was it delicious, and its not like a Traditional Pastrami all thin & what not, this was THICK, big cuts of meat. "
,,,,,Will def be back when back in the city.
,,,,,We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your first visit - drop by again next time you're in town and give our Reuben a try!
,,,,,"Katz deli is a NY tradition, everyone needs to experience at least once. There is a bit of a wait, but totally worth it, the food here is unbelievable. The Katz deli is famous for a reason and the pastrami sandwich exceeded my expectations. Highly recommended!"
,,,,,"I love Langers in Los Angeles. I came to Katz purely for the comparison and I was honestly ready for my bias to take over and say, ""yeah not as good as Langer's."""
,,,,,Long story short: I was wrong.
,,,,,"I ordered the Pastrami on Rye with Slaw to get it close to the Langer's #19. They even give you a little sliver as you wait and all I could think was ""NOW THAT'S CUSTOMER SERVICE!"" I was glad I had some hand sanitizer with me cuz I ain't tryna get that corona on the side yadig?"
,,,,,"Though it was more expensive, that pastrami is the literal truth. I was blown away. That teaser they give you as they cut that PHAT stack was the perfect morsel to whet your appetite."
,,,,,"First bite. I entered another dimension of existence. As I approached the plane of spiritual enlightenment and saw the landmark that is Langer's in my food memories, I continued to rise beyond it. Though I still think Langers has a more structurally sound sandwich and is simply a better sandwich overall (cheese and slaw complement perfectly on that) the Katz pastrami blows it out the water. "
,,,,,"I came back to my senses as I realized the sandwhich had disappeared from my hands. I was left utterly satisfied, yet craving for more."
,,,,,It's all about who you get to cut. When certain cutters are there you get the best sandwich in the world. Like the image of the sandwich on the plate. 
,,,,,"With other cutters, you receive the worst fatty cuts. The picture of the sandwich in the wrapping. Find cutters you like and stick with them."
,,,,,"Ordered the corned beef online and deliverd to New Bern NC,after raving to my friends how delicious my last order was this time I was very disappointed. The corned beef was undercooked and very hard and chewy.It will be a long time before I order again,which makes me very sad.Come on Katz get it together !"
,,,,,"So much history and hype around this place but it just didn't do it for me. Stopped by here with my family on our Xmas trip to NYC one night around 7pm. The place was PACKED. It looks like there are a couple self service order stations for different items (food, sides, drinks) and also the option for sit down with waiter service. We opted to order ourselves and fight the masses to hop on the next empty table that would seat 5 since it's free for all table wise. "
,,,,,"Onto the food, we ordered a couple pastrami, brisket and pastrami/brisket combo sandwiches with some fries of course. Sandwiches come with meat, slaw and Russian dressing (similar to Thousand Island). The meats were good but not mind-blowing. I liked the brisket a little more because it was more tender. I wish they could toast the sandwich bread but they don't do that here. I couldn't help but compare this deli to Langer's back home in LA, and Langer's takes the cake by miles in this comparison. "
,,,,,Maybe my expectations were too high coming into here
,,,,,Great Food and service what more could you ask for?! They are the best around!! Highly recommend to anyone wanting an awesome deli experience!
,,,,,"This is a must-place to eat. The sandwiches are simply amazing. This is another place worth the wait. I would suggest eating the sandwich in the deli. You want to eat it hot to fully enjoy it. It was so good. I am thinking about going there now. My personal favorites are Pastrami Sandwich, the Ruben, and the Brisket Sandwich. Oh, the pickles are just a nice touch to enhance the sandwich."

,,,,,"So delicious. Do not skip the sides and the matzah ball soup is the perfect remedy when your stomach is ""off""."
,,,,,"Not going to lie... as a college student who works part-time, I knew that it was gonna take a lot for me to justify purchasing a $25 Reuben sandwich-"
,,,,,"But after a few drinks and a late night craving, I found myself making the schlep across town right into the famous deli from ""When Harry Met Sally."""
,,,,,"Ordering was a little confusing if you've never been here before, but with help from a regular, I figured it out."
,,,,,"1) As you walk in, you are handed a ticket. Do not lose the ticket or you will be charged $50 (I'll explain this later)"
,,,,,"2) Go up to literally any of the guys or girls behind the counter, and hand them your ticket while telling them what you want (the menu is on the wall behind them)"
,,,,,3) They will write how much you owe on your ticket.
,,,,,4) Sit at any of the tables and enjoy
,,,,,5) Hand the ticket to the cashier at the door while exiting and pay there.
,,,,,"The Reuben I got was actually phenomenal. Worth $25? Questionable. But the sandwich itself was impressive and met all expectations- piled as high as the Empire State Building, was delicious, and picture worthy."
,,,,,The aforementioned regular gave me these few tips: 
,,,,,"The restaurant is not Kosher, but ""Kosher-Style"". "
,,,,,"The reason they charge $50 if you lose the ticket is because you could theoretically walk in, eat a sandwich, ""lose your ticket"" and then walk out pretending like you didn't eat anything... so the ticket is your entrance and exit pass."
,,,,,"""Their knishes aren't great. Better place down the street"""
,,,,,"All in all, great experience. I'll definitely be coming back... AFTER I have a full-time job."
,,,,,We're glad to hear you enjoyed your first visit - hope to see you back again soon!
,,,,,"I came to this iconic restaurant many years ago and decided that it was time to come back again for their famous pastrami sandwich. The line was out the door but they seem to have an efficient process in place. Once you are inside, you will be handed a ticket. Make sure you do not lose this ticket whether you are ordering anything yourself or just sharing with someone else because they will charge you for the lost ticket. "
,,,,,"My pastrami sandwich was loaded with freshly cut pieces of pastrami and a layer of swiss cheese. Yes, it is expensive at ~$25 a sandwich but half is enough to fill you up so you can definitely share it with someone. The pastrami is delicious with the perfect amount of fat inside so the meat isn't too dry. This establishment is definitely worth a visit!"
,,,,,"I have going to Katz about 44 years. Houston St. Brooklyn when they opened and today they had a stand on Fordham Road at the ""Midnight Market"". They were to be open from 12:00pm - 7:00 pm. I took a train and bus to get there only to be told at 2:55 they ran out of meat. I suggested they send for more meat and was told no way. I got on the bus then train rode to Houston St. explained the situation to the manager "
,,,,,"only to be told ""get a sandwich- you'll be ok"" no apology nothing. So I suggested she send more meat up there. This time she said ""to the Bronx no way""Guess she doesn't know people come from around the world to eat at Katz- I know because I always meet people from other countries. Hot Pastrami"
,,,,,"when you go in person, they treat you ok but i wonder how its one on line ?   i have been so dissappointed with many restaurants but i would like to know in queens.    i always make reviews and mention of i'm rating them on service or food.   today i wrote in my language so the boss sees it because the lady was nasty and didn't know how to take an order.  impatient and just hung up on me. i called back because my brother wanted it from there but never again!!!!!!!  i said if you don't fire her, i will not be back!!!!!!"
,,,,,next time i may go there and pull her from her hair out of the resturant   and embarass her in the street.   i just put good because i don't know this resturant but i heard its good.   JUST REMEMBER WHEN TAKING AN ORDER ANYWHERE.  IF THE WOMAN DOESN'T LET YOU SPEAK AND HAVE ANY PATIENCE AND HANGS UP ON YOU. LET THE BOSS OR MANAGER KNOW THAT YOU LEFT BECAUSE OF HER SO THEY CAN GET RID OF THAT INDIVIDUAL!!!!
,,,,,"It pains me to write this review but honestly, it was just ok. "
,,,,,Maybe it's impossible to live up to the hype and recognition this place has created for itself in NY and all over the country. However given that hype I was underwhelmed. 
,,,,,"Let me start by saying the pastrami, on its own was fantastic. If this was like a straight up deli that just sold pastrami by the pound then it would be 5 stars. Unfortunately they have a whole restaurant with different items and all kinds of archaic systems and customs. "
,,,,,"To start let me say we were a group of 16 people and I will give them credit for handling a group of 16 very confused people quite well. Although the place was pretty empty when we came. That being said I must say their whole ticket system is rather perplexing in 2019. With 16 people who had never been here before we had more than one lost ticket, luckily in the end I THINK everyone found their ticket. "
,,,,,However I found the whole system rather clunky and unprofessional. I mean I honestly have no idea what I paid for anything as there is no itemized receipt and the guy at the counter just scratches off and writes new totals on that ticket. Also if you pay cash you pay at the cashier but if you want to pay with a credit card you have to go see the coffee guy... after waiting in line for the cashier... wtf. 
,,,,,"Anyways onto the food. Like I said the pastrami was great, everything else. Not so much. The bread was meh and they wont toast it or anything. I LOVE pickles but the pickles were soooo briny they were inedible. I see people here saying they got 2 different kinds, one with less brine, not us, we all got the same super briny pickles. The tomatoes on the other hand were not as briny and much better (now that I think of it, maybe the switch between pickles and tomatoes?). Still I've had much better pickles. "
,,,,,"I also tried some of the meats others in our group got and none were as good as the pastrami. We also ended up spending around $40 for one sandwich, a piece of chocolate babka and a couple of coffees."
,,,,,"It was fine and I'm glad we tried it, not someplace I would probably ever come back to though. I'm sure there's other places in NYC just as good without the crazy systems and Katzs markups."
,,,,,"We're sorry to hear that you were disappointed by your experience - we never want our customers to be anything less than thrilled with the quality of their meal, or frustrated by our layout. We will take your feedback to heart and address the issue - please feel free to call and talk to a manager anytime. We hope you'll give us another chance to serve you the perfect sandwich in future!"
,,,,,"Katz's definitely is a 5 star Deli. If you aren't familiar, I highly recommend researching on YouTube the ordering process so you're not overewhelmed. Or, you can just YOLO and jump into it without any knowledge like we did lol. Once you walk into Katz's you see two huge bouncers, who give you a ticket with a bunch of numbers. It's explained that you give the tickets to the cooks, tell them what you want, and they'll write their secret code..in which you turn in to the cashier after you eat. Katz's goes by the honor system. Old school. I like it."
,,,,,"We arrived on a busy weekday lunch hour. Got our ticket from the bouncer and attempted to order but was advised I was ordering in the wrong location. Yes, there is a specific ordering location for every item you request, so be prepared to go back and forth...but I ASSURE you it's totally worth the hassle. We ordered the Philly, Tri-Tip, fries, Grilled Cheese, and Chicken Noodle. Like I said we were totally new to this is didn't realize the serving sizes were for giants, holy cannoli!! I shared the Philly with my dad and one half of the sandwich was like a fill size sandwich. The philly was rich in flavor and meat was seasoned perfectly. I watched the cook make it and he put soo much love into it. The Tri-Tip sandwich was HUGE and we could only take a couple bites lol. The soup was good as well. Katz's is a New York staple, and if you are foodies like we are, it's a must visit!"
,,,,,Food was great. First American sandwiches I actually favor! It's always busy so try to order ahead of time if you can.
,,,,,A timeless classic 
,,,,,Loaded with Pastrami you can't go wrong. 
,,,,,I believe priced at $25 a sandwich but definitely worth it. 
,,,,,"Nice, fresh & delicious pastrami on a roll! "
,,,,,Always with pickles on the side with a spread of mustard. 
,,,,,Unlike any other! 
,,,,,Their steak fries are also a major must!
,,,,,"A historic deli in the heart of the Lower East Side. This delicatessen isn't just an eatery, it's an institution and has remained virtually untouched since 1917, when it opened in its current location (originally opened across the street in 1888). This was an important congregating spot for newly immigrated families in the early 20th century. "
,,,,,"Their pastrami is incredible and famous. They cure it for over 30 DAYS and it shows. Tender, melts in your mouth. They always give you a tasting before you buy. "
,,,,,"We ordered the pastrami on rye, the corned beef on rye, the cold roast beef, 2 matzah ball soups, and it all comes with a plate of their half and full sours. The pickles are INCREDIBLE and I miss being able to find those crunchy half sours in California. "
,,,,,"Everything was perfection. Next time, we'd share one sandwich. They are that big!!"
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,"We were 3 and got 3 different sandwich, it was my first visit we are on holiday and the place it's famous. If I was gonna talk about the food I'll say the meat was delicious and fresh and the sandwich bread too that was it cause the sandwich had nothing else ( no cheese, no nothing) but it did had a lot of meat ( turkey, corn beef, pastrami) . The place was dirty, everything ,floors, walls, tables. I didn't see the kitchen so I can't talk about that. But if you like to eat a lot of meat between two slices of bread, I'll give it 5 stars, I don't, since it was good turkey, I'll give them the 4 stars."
,,,,,This place will always be my go-to spot for a pastrami sandwich. 
,,,,,"The name and fame proceeds is and therefore it can get very crowded but the food and ambiance are worth it. Entering Katz is like entering a time capsule to a simpeler live with great food, a chatty waitress and some first class pastrami."
,,,,,"Best hot pastrami I've ever had and a MUST try for tourists! One enters and receives a ticket (make sure to keep the ticket even if you don't buy anything bc that is how the restaurant keeps track of orders, losing a ticket is $50 penalty fee). Feel free to browse the menu items and asks the butchers for samples. They are all very friendly people. After ordering, feel free to sit anywhere and enjoy!"
,,,,,The cashier in the front is cash only but they do have a credit card cashier in the very back.
,,,,,"Katz's is a legendary eatery made famous in the early 1900s thanks to Abbott and Costello. At least for me. Went there as a child, took my children and now my grandchildren but only after watching the famous comedy duo's movie! A wonderful NY moment in time and memory making experience. The food! Thr sandwiches, the pickles! STILL THE BEST! And now they're in Brooklyn!"

Thr sandwiches, the pickles! STILL THE BEST! And now they're at City Point in Brooklyn!"
,,,,,Painfully pricey with a horde of patrons coming to pay homage that almost got me moaning out of duress instead of ecstacy. This at 2pm on a weekday!
,,,,,"Come in researched and ready to join 7 meat cutter self-serve lines who will take and make your order then find a table or take it out to a park nearby. If you ask for a server waited table, you will be seated along one of the tables against the wall. But you have to wait for someone in the chronically full house to vacate."
,,,,,"The line is loosely organized so you have to keep your wits about you. During your turn, the cutter will offer you a one slice taster of the meats you've ordered as a snack to foreshadow the euphoric meal ahead. The corned beef is tender, moist and salty. The brisket was lush, fatty and flavorful. But that pastrami... something special is going on there. I would have upgraded my Ruben to pastrami had I known how amazing it is..."
,,,,,Salt pickles are not my thing--should have asked for all sour.
,,,,,The tourist crowd was helpful and respectful to each other and made the chaos a relatively pleasant collective experience. 
,,,,,Scratch another off the bucket list.
,,,,,"Tap water is free, great restrooms."
,,,,,Overrated and expensive for nothing. I do not usually complain but it really is not right to ask someone to pay $35 for a sandwich. I don't care what type of meat you put into it. Especially if it doesn't taste like it's worth the money.
,,,,,Every time we come to NYC we stop here. And this time was no different. We shared a corned beef and pastrami sandwich and latkes. Woweeeee. YUM! We will definitely be back the next time we come. It's been around since 1888! You can see why. Thank you for the deliciousness!!!!!
,,,,,What else what else can we say? They got the meats. Great service and delicious food. We need to go back for the pastrami ASAP!
,,,,,"When I tell people I haven't tried Katz after living in NY all my life, they look at me like I have 3 heads. I have to say, it lives up to every hype. The pastrami slices are thick and so tender that it falls apart. Make sure you swirl some mustard in the sandwich, it makes a huge difference. "
,,,,,"Here's the process- once you walk in, you grab a ticket from the young gentleman, from here you can either make your way to the ordering counter and swim around a crowd of hungry folks trying to do the same, or you can request for waiter service. If you order from the counter it's self serve so you can find an empty seat in the middle section. If you're getting waiter service like we did, they will seat you by the long wall, they will take your order, and bring the food to your table. "
,,,,,"You pay by the cashier from the same FRONT entrance you came from. Some guy left by the back door and made a huge scene because the security (yes they have security) thought he was dipping the bill, chased and caught him and bought him back to the front. Don't be that guy. "
,,,,,"Hungry folks usually get the whole pastrami sandwich on rye with a plate of pickles to share, we also ordered the knish which is a fried mash potato shaped like a beef patty. Because they pile the meat on the sandwich, I only managed to eat half and got the rest to go."
,,,,,Best pastrami hands down but the bread they use is awful.   I can't figure it out why they can use better bread on their sandwich's.
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,"Food is awesome, but the guy at the door is so nasty and rude. Made the entire experience super uncomfortable"
,,,,,Are you a sandwich person? Do you love meat? Do you hate spending a bunch of money on a sandwich that's all bun and veggies?...
,,,,,"Welcome folks, where the sando has so much meat, it overflows and falls all over the place. Obviously you need to get cheese on it to help keep it all together. "
,,,,,We grabbed a slice of pizza down the street then swung in for the ultimate deli experience. We should've skipped the pizza lol.
,,,,,The process: walk in and get a ticket. There's someone at the door to greet you so they'll give it to you. Don't lose it or you'll pay a fee.
,,,,,"Next, pick a line. Any line with a 'Cutter #' over it. It goes up to 7 I believe. Once they're done making the food for whoever is in front of you, you'll order and wait. Give them your ticket and they'll mark what you ordered on it."
,,,,,"From there, you can either get in the back line to pay first, or grab a seat to eat and then pay. They take cash or card. "
,,,,,"Once you pay and are ready to leave, they'll staple your receipt to your cards. You'll give it to the person at the door on the way out. They'll rip off the receipt and keep the cards."
,,,,,"It's touristy, the sando is def pricier than others, but the quality is so amazing. Not only the cut of meat but the amount is insane."
,,,,,Still a NYC classic. Expensive but the sandwiches are amazing and can easily be shared. Just go.
,,,,,"NYC staple, no place quite like it and whoever tells you they've had a better pastrami sandwich is a straight up liar.  Don't sleep on the sides, steak fries and coleslaw are always great."
,,,,,"Spent $35 to get a Reuben, knish, and pickles. The Reuben and pickles was great but not worth $30. The knish didn't have much flavor. This place is overrated in my opinion."
,,,,,Cash only
,,,,,"When I am about to visit a new city and look up places to eat, the first thing I do is search for restaurants in that city on Yelp, then sort by most reviewed. When you do that for New York, Katz's is #1."
,,,,,I came right when it opened at 8am and it was completely empty. I recommend coming as early as possible as I'm told it can get really packed and might be hard to find a table. When you walk in you get a ticket. After you order the worker writes the cost of your order on your ticket and you pay on the way out.
,,,,,I ordered the pastrami sandwich on rye ($22.45). I got to try a little bit of pastrami before the worker made my sandwich and it was a great teaser for what was to come. When I took a bite of the sandwich the pastrami just melted in my mouth. It was so soft and juicy and just delicious. The rye bread was soft as well and the pickles and cucumbers help cleanse the mouth from the saltiness of the pastrami. It's completely stacked with meat and it was so filling that by the end I couldn't finish the bread and only ate the pastrami.
,,,,, 
,,,,,It's a little on the pricey side but the quality of meat is totally worth it. It's also very filling and the pastrami is to die for. It's a must-go in New York and I now see why Katz's is the most reviewed.
,,,,,"COVID-19 adjusted. Always the best pastrami in town. Pickles,cole slaw, knishes always delicious. The cutters always do a great job making the sandwiches and giving you a sample. Unfortunately eating on the sidewalk is not my idea of fun. Will definitely go back and eat there again when we can sit at a table and really enjoy the meal without the noises of the LES. The best!"
,,,,,"If heaven has a cafeteria, this would be it. Comically surly staff, phenomenal food, and atmosphere for days. Be prepared for a wait, and a crowd, and do your research before you go. They have a specific way you order, are seated, and pay and they don't show a lot of patience for the uninformed. All that aside, though, the food was first class and a bucket list item for me. You can watch the sandwich creators do their work on the spot and a lot of corned beef passes through this restaurant. More importantly, the corned beef was very good. It was piled high as I would have expected, but it also was just better than some other corned beef sandwiches I have tried. It is worth a visit to eat the corned beef alone."
,,,,,"Okay, I was a little skeptical. That being said, the sandwiches are legit. We decided to be served. It was worth not waiting in line and trying to find a seat. "
,,,,,"Got the Pastrami, the cornbeef Sammie's! The soup was also legit. The food was amazing and the service good. Def a must if your in NY. "
,,,,,"I don't have anything bad to say about this place. It's a little pricy, but not bad."
,,,,,"Amazing portion!!! Corned beef is very tender and flavorful. He even gave me samples of the beef after I ordered, interesting service."

,,,,,The holidays this year have been tough as we celebrate in intimate settings without our loved ones. However sometimes the gift of food can bring a lot of joy to the ones we can't be with. This Hanukkah we sent a full Hanukkah dinner to our elderly parents. We can't be with them but it doesn't mean we can't celebrate. I ordered enough food for multiple meals so they had future lunches and dinners. My parents were completely overwhelmed with every food item and it completely made their day. My sweet father not only called all of us to thank us when it arrived but when he sat down for dinner last night. 
,,,,,Their on line ordering is simple and the food comes with clear heating instructions with fabulous packaging. My mom thought we were so generous but my sister and I thought it was very reasonable. Keep in mind the elderly are struggling with extreme isolation and sometimes it just takes one good meal to bring them joy!
,,,,,"Love this place!! Always go when I'm in town. Last time though the guy preparing my order did not give me a taste of the pastrami like usual. Maybe he was distracted by the girl who ordered in front of me. He was friendly , flirted and hooked her up with plenty of a pastrami sample. "
,,,,,Hardly uttered a word to me. I always tip big but not this time. 
,,,,,    Sandwich was awesome.
,,,,,"Basics done right. Katz's offers a variety of sandwiches and sides but they're most known for their infamous pastrami sandwich. I came in with a few friends after hours and we were given tickets to track our orders. Whether or not you order food, you'll need to return the ticket at the end or incur a $50 fee. "
,,,,,"My friend and I split the gigantic pastrami sandwich on rye, accompanied by complimentary pickles. The sandwich itself is extremely simple, and to be honest, I didn't expect much based on looks purely. Biting into the sandwich, however, I really appreciated the simplicity of it all. The bread is fresh and soft, a great vessel for the tender pastrami. There's extra mustard and ketchup on the tables should you prefer heavier dressing, but I thought the sandwich was excellent by itself. "
,,,,,"Although the portions are generous (you can definitely split a sandwich between two people), I felt that it was a bit pricey at $22."
,,,,,PURCHASED: Brisket on Rye ($24) + swizz cheese ($1.00) 
,,,,,TOTAL: ~$25
,,,,,PROS:
,,,,,+ tasty: Certainly tasty--I will give it a 4.3 out of 5 as it pertains to taste. That deli mustard packed into that fat sandwich on some rye bread was delicious. 
,,,,,"+ filling: Certainly filling, I ate half of the monstrous sandwich. I was satiated. Finishing the rest of the sandwich was a little bit of work. Though, if you've read my other reviews, you'll know that I have a large stomach capacity. "
,,,,,+ open-24-7: This location is open all day and night. 
,,,,,"+ free meat tasting: When you get to the front of the many lines to the long bar of butchers, they'll ask you what you want. You might respond with, ""I'll take the brisket on rye."" The butcher will find the meat, slap it down in front of you on his side of the glass. They'll slice a few pieces off, place it into a cup, and serve it to you while you watch them make your monster 'wich. "
,,,,,"+ vegetarian-friendly: They got a lot of stuff. E.g., latkes, knishes, toasted cheese, et cetera "
,,,,,"+cultural treasure: Arguably, I would consider Katz's a rich american cultural treasure. The jewish culture of cuisine. It's F****** awesome! If you are from Houston TX you'll know that there is a Katz's there. This Katz's is the original spot. The walls are tall and the wall space is massive. Riddled all over the walls are famous photos of celebrities all over. "
,,,,,CONS:
,,,,,"- price: The price is steep: $24 bucks for a sandwich. Though, you can think of it as $12 for half of the sandwich which is just above a degree of what it should cost. In my opinion, I think it should be no more than $10. "
,,,,,"- tipping the butchers: Though, I do like the spot. I don't like the fact that one of the butchers had reportedly tapped the tip jar as my girl friend left with her platter of her sandwich. I do like the idea of good service being rewarded. However, I do not like when it is ""demanded"" or ""suggested."""
,,,,,IMPRESSION:
,,,,,"Excellent excellent place to take someone who's seeing New York City for the first time. I have said plenty of positive things about this place. It is a sort of one-time visit kind of spot because of the price. I would not go here regularly. Though, if you're hosting friends from out-of-town, you can see yourself come back. TLDNR: Go if it's late, you're on the lower east and have $20 to have a meal for more than 2 people."
,,,,,"Took my girlfriend here once. Loved it. Took her again when she was my fiancée, loved it. Took her again as my wife a few days ago through Covid and i gotta say. Though i now live in Georgia. These guys were sweethearts and super cool folk. Marino was our cutter and Damian gave me the run down of the beers and showed me what paired well. Usually the place is packed but we went early and a Monday and it was a great decision. The folks are kind and informative af. Thanks again guys."
,,,,,"this place is very good and is a staple of the community. I think that it is a must-try when visiting here. My favorite part of the experience is when you go up to the counter to order they let you try a piece of the pastrami as they are making your sandwich, let me tell you that once you try that you are dying for a bite of your sandwich!"
,,,,,"This is a famous sandwich for a reason, and their homemade pickles are amazing!!! Make sure to come early as the lines get really long,"
,,,,,We're so glad that you've enjoyed your visits here - our long time fans make our jobs so rewarding and fun. Hope to see you back again soon for another pastrami fix!
,,,,,This place just gets better and better!! The perfect balance between HERITAGE & FLAVOR & EXPERIENCE!! 
,,,,,YES... the ordering process is a pain in the ass if its your first time!!
,,,,,YES... this is going to be the BEST Delicatessen Food you've ever eaten!!
,,,,,YES... you're gonna give a couple bucks to the person who carves your meat because you want a sample of that BEEF-MAGIC that hits the plate on the glass counter that's soooo unique and flavorful you can't find it anywhere else!!
,,,,,YES... the staff are New Yorkers so their all about speed but their also a SUPER-FRIENDLY-BUNCH!!
,,,,,Come checkout the icon and become a cult-follower yourself ;)
,,,,,Amazing Pastrami! Good experience. Covid protocols in place. Make sure to tip the cutters.
,,,,,Instagram worthy and pricey but you have to love pastrami and latkes because that's what it is. Definitely recommend trying.
,,,,,The best pastrami I have ever had. Wow!  What a joy!  
,,,,,Come in and be prepared to wait. You have options:  you can wait for a table and order or order and then get a table. Not sure which way to go!  
,,,,,Lots of selections. I could return many times and try the wide variety of options. Wow. Huge menu. 
,,,,,Had matzo ball soup too. Good.  The pastrami had a wonderful smoke flavor. Wow. They serve a few pickles while you wait. 
,,,,,I could write more. It is simple down home. Busy and good.

,,,,,Had a birthday order shipped to Islamorada Florida package arrived intact came with pastrami and corn beef the corn beef package had a whole in the vacuum pack the meet came freezer burnt . Sent them email they didn't even acknowledge my email
,,,,,"Overpriced no matter how much you want a pile of meat on decent bread. This is a tourist trap I regret thinking I had to try as a former NYer. There is no love in the ingredients other than the meat (which, yes was moist) which I personally think is too thickly sliced (corned beef). My bf adored his pastrami and I get it, but for me...Perhaps I should go to an Irish deli because I have no idea what I am saying, but almost 25 bucks for a sandwich should be illegal if it's just deli meat. Too much sodium also (I know it's kind of supposed to be, but not like this). Pickles were great as well as the staff who were mostly super helpful and friendly. Place was packed in early afternoon, but strictly follows Covid policies so you can feel safe dining. 6 hours after eating LESS than half a sandwich and I still taste salt."
,,,,,I was very excited to try this place. Never again. Guys behind the counter had the worse customer service. This one guy in particular insulted me by talking to me rude and then call me an asshole just because he had to get a soda twice two steps away. Then told me to give him back the food. The service and food sucks all in all. The worse Ive tried! If you want the experience of a rude worker. Look for the guy in the photo. The manager will probably back him up again and not have him apologize to you. Incredible training at NY's finest place to dine.
,,,,,"I have been wanting to try out Katz's Deli for a very long time but I never made it here in all my visits to New York. I made it a point this time around to book a hotel in the Low East Side so I had no excuse not to go..As soon as I checked into my hotel, I trekked over to Katz's."
,,,,,"I am in awe of restaraunts and establishments that have been around forever. If you read my reviews, you would know that. ;) Katz's Deli was established in 1888 meaning that it has gone through World Wars and the changing of trends through the decades. Great will always be great, so Katz still stands. "
,,,,,"I was not sure what to try, the pastrami or the corned beef. I decided on the corned beef and come back for the pastrami. I don't think I could have gone wrong with either but the corned beef was very tender and delicious. The rye bread was packed with thick slices of perfect corned beef. There was a lot of sandwich so I did not order a side. The free dish of kosher pickles were enough as a side item and a great pairing to the sandwiches. "
,,,,,Everything was top here and looking forward to my next visit for that pastrami!
,,,,,We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your first visit - we love making new fans. Hope to see you back again soon for that pastrami fix!
,,,,,"Katz's doesn't need another complementary review but it is that good. Their meats are simply exceptional and their portions are unrivaled. Their prices are moderate by NYC standards, especially considering the portions you get with each sandwich. Going to Katz's is a fun experience. You stand anxiously waiting for your meal and are forced to watch your butcher meticulously carve your meat. You are given just a small piece that will surely give you an appetite if you didn't already have one. If you are looking for an incredibly unique NYC experience, going to Katz's is a must! "
,,,,,"Rueben (5/5): Their famous Rueben is exactly what you could ask for. Fresh rye bread with huge pieces of perfectly cured pastrami, mounds of cheese, and plenty of sauerkraut. They give you so much pastrami it will surely not fit within the sandwich, which is a problem I don't mind having when the meat is this good. "
,,,,,"Corn beef (5/5): Their corn beef, though not as popular as the pastrami and brisket, is also delicious. They marble the fat perfectly so that every piece is unusually tender. It is easy for corn beef to have a tough texture, but not one piece we had was anything other than juicy and tender! "
,,,,,"Latkes (5/5): Their latkes are thick and very doughy. They have a perfect char to them. If you have never had one, it is basically an exceptional hash brown. These are a great compliment to any sandwich or meat option. A single order is enough for a couple to split easily! "
,,,,,"Going to Katz's is not an overrated experience, NYC is filled with those. Their unique and storied location and great food makes this an indulgence anyone can enjoy!"
,,,,,"Who cares what she's having or who met who.  Get yourself a pastrami on rye(go ahead and add some mustard) and an egg cream.  This place should be on everyone's bucket list.  Amazing pastrami sandwich on rye.  This was the first place I hit on my first trip to NYC and it did not disappoint.  Pictures and words can't describe that first bite of my first Katz pastrami sandwich. Pure food bliss.  If you make it to this place don't let the lines scare you away.  This place is worth every minute in line.  For all my peeps in SoCal, you'll never settle for the same old pastrami once you've had Katz.  "
,,,,,Much love from SoCal to all the staff carving away behind the counter.
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your first visit - there's nothing we love more than making new fans. And if you're ever craving a cross-country pastrami fix, we do offer free two-day shipping no all orders over $100! Hope to see you back again next time you're in town."
,,,,,The Reuben sandwich was huge and so delicious. A little pricey but worth it ! You have to visit Katz's when you're in New York !
,,,,,"Yeah, Katz's is touristy but it really hit the spot when we were hangry and looking for dinner at midnight after flying in from the west coast. Katz's is open 24 hours on weekends and we ended up here after finding that everything near our hotel was closed. I first went to Katz's a few years ago and thought it was good but not great - on that occasion I had their famous pastrami on rye sandwich even though I really prefer corned beef. "
,,,,,"This time I got the corned beef on rye this time and it was great.  Tender, salty, and fatty - and plenty of it!  I also ordered a bowl of matzoh ball soup and a creme soda to wash it all down. It was exactly what I wanted for dinner at midnight and far exceeds any deli back at home in the Bay Area."
,,,,,We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your first visit - there's nothing we love more than making new fans. Hope to see you back again next time you're in town!
,,,,,"The BEST pastrami sandwich I've ever had - every time!!! Fabulous matzoh ball soup, a great hot dog that ""snap"" when you bite into it - love onions and sauerkraut w/mustard on mine..."
,,,,,"For sides - order a plate of french fries, and a can of Dr. Brown's soda, and they have beer on tap as well... "
,,,,,"it's a classic restaurant and everyone should drip by! AND -  They let you ask for/taste a bite of either the corned beef, pastrami, brisket, turkey breast or roast beef when you're building your sandwich !"
,,,,,"I was extremely satisfied with this place! It lived up to the hype! The sandwich was HUGE, enough for two people! We got the hot pastrami on rye bread with Russian dressing and pickles on the side. The Russian dressing added the perfect flavor to the sandwich but to be honest I could've eaten the pastrami by itself. It was so tender, juicy and full of flavor!"

,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,New York STAPLE!!! Look it has a bit of a hype...but it lives up to the hype! Something about pastrami sandwiches at Katz's that just isn't the same anywhere else! Enjoy!
,,,,,"I made a mission to stop by this classic joint, when I visited New York this time.  I had light dinner, so I can have room for this bad boy.  We took the train for 32nd and took us about 20minutes.  Line was not bad at all.  We opted to dine in without a server. And yes you have to have vaccination card in order to dine here!! We all received a ticket that looked like a raffle ticket for football booster club.  Since we Already had a dinner, I was only gonna order one Katz Pastrami sandwich.  As I waited in a short line I can see the pictures on the wall of famous celebrities who dined here.  And of course picture of the movie ""When Harry Met Sally"". Finally one of the counter opened up for ordering and I ordered one Kats Pastrami sandwich with club bread and coleslaws.  My butcher or worker cut couple of slices of the pastrami and put it on the small plate for me to taste. And as I took a bite it tasted good and familiar. My butcher ask if I wanted mustard, even though I didn't ask for it from the beginning of the order and I'm glad I said yes!  When he finished marking the sandwich he dropped 4 cut pickles on to the plate.  sandwich was really good and if I didn't eat dinner before I probably would have finished it.  After done eating I was little confused because I have not paid and I opted for no server.  You actually pay when you exit out with the ticket with price that the butcher wrote down. But when you pay with card you have to pay at the last counter and and show the receipt when to exit out."
,,,,,"Yikes! I just mailed two of their birthday packs to friends across the country but now I'm embarrassed to have sent them after getting a taste of the pastrami tonight. Dined in, 7pm on a Monday night. No line to get in but plenty of people inside. The pastrami was cold, no heat at all, and even worse it was undercooked so it was quite tough. Yep cold and tough is not the Katz's pastrami we dream about & not the same as the countless previous occasions. I'm all for giving good places a second chance but I won't be going back anytime soon."
,,,,,"We were really excited to try out Katz's, especially their famous pastrami sandwich, but found it underwhelming. The line wasn't too bad and moved relatively fast. We only ordered the pastrami sandwich. I won't go into the details of how the restaurant is set up since it's been over explained already by numerous other reviewers. So I will get on to the sandwich itself. "
,,,,,"The pastrami to bread ratio is impressive, however when you're paying $25/sandwich, I do expect a decent amount of pastrami. Perhaps I don't have the most refined palate, but I found the flavors of the sandwich to fall flat. All I tasted was salt from the pastrami and the add-on mustard. The bread was pretty crumbly and couldn't hold up after the first few bites. I suppose, I expected the flavors of the sandwich to have more depth--it didn't even taste smoky to me. In fact, just yesterday, I ordered a pastrami sandwich from a small deli shop that had a greater flavor profile compared to Katz's. "
,,,,,"I saw that the two neighboring tables also seemed quite disappointed with the sandwich, perhaps I'm not the only one here."
,,,,,Place is absolutely amazing the staff was very helpful and they noticed that I had a disability and walking and they took care of me send me down and help me get in and out of my chair and also helped out with the food I could not ask for anything more so than with what they have done kudos to the owners
,,,,,"Pre- covid , I bought only  a half pound of their roast beef, its $15 , since its Katz deli and it is really the go to - place to eat , I thought it would be good, but this roast beef is not good, it is dry, and not delicious. Other deli' s or other places like Zabar's,  Fairway, whole foods,  keyfood, food emporium, stew leonard's,  etc... have  also good roast beef.  The movie  ( is it when harry met sally ? ) made this place well known ."
,,,,,What can I say?  The NYC icon is worth every dollar of the $20 per sandwich.  The atmosphere alone is just incredible. The Harry met Sally story is pretty awesome too. 
,,,,,We ordered our sandwich and received a taste. That was a nice touch. Do not lose your ticket you get when you walk in. Otherwise it will cost you a cool $50!  
,,,,,You'll enjoy this place!

,,,,,"Eating at this restaurant is akin to visiting Elis island for foodies. Its a tourist stop, but not a tourist trap! This restaurant has been around since 1888, serving their famous pastrami sandwich. "
,,,,,THE PASTRAMI SANDWICH (You must get this!)
,,,,,"Really good juicy meat, very salty and fatty - you won't taste this kind of flavor anywhere else. You really should put some mustard all over the meat before you dig in. Goes well with soda. I recommend only getting the half-sandwich as its almost impossible to finish a whole pastrami sandwich. "
,,,,,THE SPLIT PEA SOUP V. MATZO BALL SOUP
,,,,,"The split pea soup is good, but I would recommend the matzo ball soup over it. You can probably make a better split pea soup at home. "
,,,,,THE BRISKET SANDWICH (don't order this)
,,,,,I don't recommend this one at all. The meat was very dry and the mustard can't save the fact that this meat is just not very good. 
,,,,,THE PICKLES
,,,,,I love the fact that they give you two kinds of pickles: cucumber like pickles and fermented pickles. 
,,,,,THE SALAD
,,,,,"The dressing actually is pretty tasty and goes well balancing the fattiness of the pastrami sandwich. I recommend it for those of us, like me, who want something fresh to go along with your pastrami sandwich!"
,,,,,SERVICE
,,,,,"Waitress was strange and our interactions with her were very awkward. At some point she even told my bfs stepdad that ""we"" (meaning his wife, my bf, his sons, and me I guess?) weren't his friends."
,,,,,I think it's overhyped. The bread is just okay and the pastrami is dry. And it's expensive. I have tried better pastrami sandwich. But if ya wanna try for the experience why not.
,,,,,"I'll admit, I was skeptical about a $20 sandwich. It was worth. Trust all the reviews and the wall full of celebrities that have visited; just go. "
,,,,,"There's a TON of meat inside the sandwich. In fact, I would describe it more like a heap of meat that happens to come with bread than a sandwich. Like I said, just go - the hype is real."

,,,,,"This is a popular New York institution, and I recently ended up eating here for the first time after years of living in NYC, that is because I always got turned off by the huge line outside the door. Anyhow, i went on a rainy day and to my surprise there wasn't a line outside, though there was a short one inside the deli. I was able to get to the counter in about 10 mins, which was great. I ordered, half pastrami sandwich (with mustard) and a cup of Matzah ball soup."
,,,,,"What can I say, the sandwich was great, pastrami was warm and delicious, almost melts in your mouth. Matzah ball soup was the best I've had so far in the city."
,,,,,Love Katz! They have the best sandwiches and great people working there. I went for a week straight. Don't forget the pickles pause.
,,,,,Really fun place to get the best pastrami. I love it! 
,,,,,I could say some things I don't like about this place pretty easily but I think this place should just be graded on the atmosphere and the pastrami. Although I hear they make the best hot dog in the city. Pricey but fun!
,,,,,We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your first visit - drop by again soon next time you're in town!
,,,,,"All the buzz about Katz Deli had me excited to try this place. Now that I finally did, I can say it was just okay. This place is pretty iconic and famous since it was featured in 'When Harry Met Sally' movie. They even have the sign pointed to the seat/area where the scene took place. As you walk in the restaurant, you are handed a blue ticket and all the employee said is to keep this ticket with you and you'll need it as you walk out so I assume the ticket is needed to order. There are several stations where you place your order and there is slight confusion because apparently there were separate station for the sandwiches, sides, and drinks. I wish they would explain as soon as you walk the door how the ordering process worked and how the credit card machine is mixed in with the drinks/sides line (not to be confusing at all)."
,,,,,"For the food, we ordered the pastrami sandwich with plenty sides of pickle and fries. The sandwich itself was just okay. It was a huge serving but nothing out of this world good. I enjoyed the pickle sides more than I did the sandwich. This establishment pretty much encourages to pay in cash and the prices were pretty expensive. It's cool to say I've been to this iconic restaurant, I don't dislike it but it's not my favorite."
,,,,,Real authentic pastrami sandwiches !! I've been eating for cats for over 20 years and there quality has never changed
,,,,,"I would say 3 stars overall, but the meat earns the 4th star.  "
,,,,,"Definitely a tourist trap, and if I were local, the pastrami is worth the extra $, as it is, hands down, the best I've ever had.  "
,,,,,How many of us have ever had warm pastrami?!
,,,,,It's the rest that falls apart. 
,,,,,We sat and waited too long for our waitress to show.  They gave us a SUBSTANTIAL amount of pickles that were WAY too salted to enjoy.  I love fresh pickles but these aren't what you'd expect.  It feels like a huge waste to assume 4 people want a pile of pickles. 
,,,,,The babes enjoyed the roast beef on their sandwich but the bread that came with our sandwiches was not worth the $20+ price of them. 
,,,,,I would recommend splitting a sandwich and seeking out a salad elsewhere to offset the insane pile of meat.  
,,,,,"The latkes were super thick and filling and large (and I enjoyed the flavor), but too cooked for my mom's taste and didn't come with enough sauce and sour cream. "
,,,,,I don't know why NY places are so keen on American cheese but there's enough real cheese available now cheddar should be an option!
,,,,,Meat on meat on meat!! Been knowing this place since I was in the west coast through YouTube. 
,,,,,"The order of ordering goes like this: You are given a ticket by the entrance, go up to one of the cutter and wait for your turn to order, get your food and hand your cutter the ticket, eat, pay at the register, then leave by getting your ticket checked at the exit. "
,,,,,"While you are ordering, your cutter will give you a piece of the meat in your order just to taste. Extremely tender beef they serve here, and they serve A LOT!! After half a sandwich, i got the feeling that i ate an entire steak. Food here is a bit salty overall."
,,,,,"Though this is one of those must-stop-by famous spot, the price range is still pretty affordable for good quality beef."
,,,,,"Ordered the famous pastrami sandwich ($23) which comes with rye bread, mustard (if you want), a TON of pastrami, and a side of pickle. While the bread was nothing special and the pickles were not my favorite, the pastrami was AMAZING! My boyfriend and I haven't really had pastrami before so we were hesitant about ordering a sandwich with basically just a boatload of pastrami, but it was definitely worth it and filled us both up! "
,,,,,We came during lunchtime on a Sunday and we only waited in line for ~5 minutes. The place is very organized and is definitely taking COVID precautions as well.
,,,,,We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your first visit - there's nothing we love more than making new fans. Hope to see you back again soon for another pastrami fix!
,,,,,"Pro tip : ask for thinly sliced. Make sure you tip the cutter. Even if you're paying by card at the cashier, keep a few bucks handy to tip the cutter coz that's where it's at. Go easy on the mustard coz you definitely wanna taste that pastrami."
,,,,,You want the pastrami. Unless you're tired of it don't order anything else. There is definitely reason why this place has survived (thrived) this long. That pastrami is boss level flavor. I got it on rye bread and this was my first time tasting rye bread and it tasted great.
,,,,,I really wish they'd add some packaged chips to the menu. The fries were too much for me.
,,,,,The beer selection was perfect. Just the right options.
,,,,,Got here just before the Sat tourist lunch rush circa 11:40am. Ordered frankfurters and pastrami on rye to share. My favourite is the Pastrami on Rye. Expensive but worth every cent. Comes with two types of pickles too.. definitely plenty to share between two. 
,,,,,"Each adults are given a green ticket each so they can figure out what you have ordered. If you are paying by card then pay at the back corner, right hand side. Cash is taken at the entrance of the restaurant. Green tickets are checked before you exit to make sure you are all settled with all the charges. "
,,,,,People are also given the choice of self service vs. full service tables. I opted for the self service option given it was pretty early and there were tables readily available. 
,,,,,Left just a little bit over 12:30pm and there wasn't a queue outside. Four frankfurters and a pastrami on rye ended up just a tad over $50.
,,,,,So glad to hear you enjoyed your visit - hope to see you back again next time you're on the LES!

,,,,,It was okay to go to the most famous deli in Manhattan. Now line is not too long but it is pricey for breakfast. Self order only nice taking photos.
,,,,,It's one of New York City's most popular places to eat. 
,,,,,Great food and amazing sandwiches . I've Been going here since I was a kid . Always thumbs up !
,,,,,"Get the pastrami on rye bread with extra mustard, the meat is super tender, flavorful and cooked to perfection. The perfect, flavourful, melt in your mouth pastrami. We also got fries and matzah ball soup."
,,,,,We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your meal. Hope to see you back again soon for another pastrami fix!
,,,,,Historical restaurant to go. We had what we deserved to try. All the best. Pastrami is our favorite.
,,,,,"I didn't understand why the pastrami sandwich was $25 until I went there on a first date. It was not only the best pastrami I'd ever eaten, but there was enough of it to save some for two more sammies at home. Well worth the money and a fun date."
,,,,,Katz's was always my GO to Deli . 
,,,,, I Moved away from NYC 40 years ago.
,,,,,l now live in the East Bay Area of San Francisco there are no deli's that can compare. 
,,,,,I just received my first order from Katz's .
,,,,,"That The best idea I have ever had .The pastrami was superb , as were the pickles , Rye bread, bagels, knishes and black and whites . Everything was as good as i remembered it!"
,,,,,"Their shipping is free if you order $100 of product , not hard to do! Everything is so good! "
,,,,,The delivery across country came on time as promised! 
,,,,,The packaging was great and everything was cold because of the 4 large ice packs were still frozen solid  after a 2day shipping .   I will be ordering again over the weekend .  Packaging
,,,,,Katz deli should not be missed while in NY. This place is worth the walk and wait to try out one of their amazing sandwiches.
,,,,,I had the salami here and it definitely did not disappoint. We didn't have to wait too long and our cutter Henry was great! They serve the sandwich with a side of pickles and you have plenty of cuts to try here. 
,,,,,The deli is a short walk from the 2nd Ave subway station where you can catch the F line to a nearby station and connect if needed. It's also not too far from Prince Street if you are coming to or heading to that area.
,,,,,This could be my shortest review and I haven't been to Katz before. Many might not know and let it be known... I would like to say thank you so much for your continuing support to our frontliners. May you receive tenfold of blessing.
,,,,,My wife and I went to Katz's Delicatessen when we were in New York City this past February.
,,,,,We arrived at about 11:30am and got in no problem. The restaurant was about a quarter full when we got there but steadily became more and more busy and was at least halfway full by the time we left.
,,,,,We ordered the Pastrami Sandwich and a side of pickles to share. The sandwich is gigantic and can easily be shared by two people. The hand carved pastrami is smokey and juicy and practically melts in your mouth. The bitterness from the yellow mustard and acidity and crunch from the pickles complimented the sandwich perfectly. Who would have thought a sandwich as simple as pastrami and yellow mustard on rye with pickles on the side could be this good? The Pastrami Sandwich was unbelievable!
,,,,,You can't go to NYC without going to Katz's Delicatessen - make sure to get the Pastrami Sandwich with pickles on the side. Highly recommended. Five stars.
,,,,,"No trip to NYC is complete without my obligatory stop at Katz's for a pastrami on rye with mustard.  The entire experience is magical...it's like Disney World for a fat guy.  You come in and get your ticket from the security guard that would give Suge Knight a run for his money.  You wait in line, they give you samples of whatever you're getting, grab your beverage and find your table.  "
,,,,,"I don't like cliche's but the way Meg Ryan enjoyed her sandwich is what you should be expecting.  Savor whatever it is you get, because it is all just THAT GOOD.  "
,,,,,"Some words of advice, they're open 24 hours so you can go whenever.  I don't like to wait if possible and could eat this 24 hours a day.  I always go in on Sunday mornings and have never waited in line.  Don't lose your ticket though....they don't like that too much."

,,,,,"What can you say-it's an institution. The staff is great and so is the food. You can't eat it every day, but once in a while, there is nothing better than their potato pancakes, pastrami sandwich, egg cream......."
,,,,,What can you say? Katz's is the bomb! The only downside is calories. Great latkes and matzo ball soup for those who are less carnivorous! Amazing egg creams.
,,,,,I never liked pastrami before Katz's. Now I'll never like another pastrami again
,,,,,Definitely can see why this place is famous
,,,,,My fiancée and I had this delivered to our hotel room and it was absolutely fire. The pastrami sandwich with swiss.......bliss! The latkes and the black and white cookie were also completely bonkers!
,,,,,Katz is one of the best if not the best deli in the lower east side. For meat eaters this place has it all. I always get the pastrami Reuben sandwich and it's to die for.
,,,,,What a classic! 
,,,,,"I love this place. My go to is a pastrami on rye with mustard and pickles of course. Oh and don't forget to grab and order of latkes on your way out . If you haven't been before and you're on the fence about it, trust me it's so worth it!!"
,,,,,"As always line was crazy,  but 10 min later we  were served and 15 were walking out of the restaurant with 8 pastrami sandwiches bag of pickles and French fries. "
,,,,,Honestly I'm not a meat eater but family were enjoying every bite they took!!!!
,,,,,Recommendations:
,,,,,-Ask for both pickles and semi-pickled cucumbers 
,,,,,-extra ketchup 
,,,,,-extra mustard 
,,,,,Be ready to pay a bit more...
,,,,,Had to stop by along the way through the city of course. The lines are no joke really but about the same as any relatively popular place that I had been to between waiting in line and getting a table to the service lapses if that's the dilemma. The guys at the counter were extremely helpful with questions despite the mad shuffle going on inside. Waters were available in the back along with a host of plastic cups to use. 
,,,,,"Honestly, I think the hardest part was finding a seat more so than anything else. The tables didn't feel crazy packed together though. I had gotten a matzo ball soup and a reuben. Half of that went with me for the flight back actually. The reuben was good and clean. Didn't wow me per se, just a deli sandwich tho at the end of the day. The matzo ball soup was much better here than the other time I tried it. Broth definitely held up well and made a better meal out of it for sure. "
,,,,,"In retrospect, I think next time I'm through I'll get a pastrami. Not that the reuben didn't hit the mark, I just think the pastrami is more visually appealing. Eat with the eyes before the stomach after all."
,,,,,"Iconic deli, so good through the years with tender, faty, juicy pastrami, served the old fashion way in a historical location. Also love the matza ball soup, the latkes served with apple sauce and sour cream, and all the other delicious goodies (pickles, cookies, salamis, etc) you can get there. Prices are not cheap, but the generous portions and the idea of eating through NY best deli makes it worth it."
,,,,,"My friend Lori L. has led me to many fine things.  She alerted me to Augie's Montreal Deli when it first opened, she told me about Boichik Bagels before they opened their brick and mortar store, and then she told me when she was going to order from Katz's for delivery.  I added a pound of tongue to her order, which arrived Wednesday.  If you order $100 worth, delivery is free.  Lori lives up the hill from me, so it's convenient for both of us.  She threw in a couple of bagels, one everything, one plain, and a couple of slices of rye bread."
,,,,,"I had a tongue sandwich for lunch today and it was fabulous, much better than the tongue from Zarri's, which is pickled.  I used part of the package and put the rest in the freezer for another sandwich or two in a few weeks.  Alan and I had the bagels yesterday, the everything for him and the plain for me.  Katz's doesn't make an onion bagel, just everything, plain and maybe poppy seed.  Lori tells me their everything bagels don't have caraway seeds on them, just onions, poppy seeds and sesame seeds.  Those I would eat, because it's the caraway seeds I object to.  So Alan and I will order a dozen bagels the next time Lori orders, maybe a loaf of rye bread, maybe some black & whites, which she mentioned and which I've never had.  Lori is definitely leading me off the path of righteousness, and it's delicious!"
,,,,,"This place stays busy, I hear about it all the time but never got around to trying them out until recently because it was my friend's birthday and she wanted to go. "
,,,,,"It's mad busy in here, luckily when I arrived there was no line outside and only a 20-minute wait for table service.  The alternative was a wait to order in one of the many sandwich lines and then seat ourselves in the communal seating areas. Oh yeah, there's two big security guards at the door on the way in and out.  One gives you a pink ticket on the way in that gets marked once you've paid for your meal, the other checks to see if said ticket is marked on the way out. Also, don't lose the ticket or it will cost you a pretty penny in fees on the way out.  You could argue with them like I saw a family doing when I came in, but by the looks of the security gaurds, I wouldn't want any smoke with them."
,,,,,"Anyways, the food was fabulous.  The pastrami was amazing. It literally melts in your mouth and was everything with a side of mayonnaise. The matzo ball soup was delicious as well, it was my first time having it and I was impressed. I also dig that this place makes its own lemonade.  Moreover, Katz is pretty pricey but the food and the experience are worth it."
,,,,,"All in all, I can finally say that I've had what she's having and it was absolutely delicious."
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your first visit. Though we do often serve a packed house, if you want to try dodging the crowds drop by at an off-peak hour: breakfast, between lunch/dinner or late nights on weekends. Hope to see you back again next time you're in town!"

,,,,,One of the best: 
,,,,,THEY STLL HAVE IT !! The best OVERSIZED pastrami on rye with mustard and more pickles then you can eat. 
,,,,,Covid precautions they have in place are:
,,,,,They have plexiglass every place and were directing traffic inside and they asked for proof of vaccine. 
,,,,,It still  LOOKS THE SAME!! Same OLD furniture and chairs and pictures on the walls of the stars from 20 years ago!  They need to upgrade the furniture and rotate the pictures. Parking is always an issue but it is located in the lower Eastside of Manhattan so what do you expect! I happened to luck out and get a meter across the street. when it is your turn you hand them your ticket they give you a sample of the pastrami before they make your sandwich and once you finish you can go to the next line for something to drink and then you take a seat on your own. when you leave the restaurant if you're using a credit card you pay at the back of the restaurant and if you were using cash you pay at the front.  The sandwich is so big I never can eat the whole thing.   you can always go up and let them know you need a take-out bag they will gladly give you the wrapping paper and a special bag for the pickles. if I had to say something negative I would say parking but that's Manhattan and the second thing would be the old furniture and decor but that's what they're famous for. I would definitely recommend it because the flavor is still on point and I will definitely be back!
,,,,,Hot Pastrami is one of the best in NYC. Make sure get it with the rye bread and the mustered. It a huge sandwich.
,,,,,"Katz's Delicatessen since 1888!!!! This Jewish deli came highly recommended by my childhood friend from New York. It has also been the backdrop of many Hollywood movies, such as Meg Ryan's scene from the movie"
,,,,,"'When Harry Met Sally.' Remember? ""I'll have what she's having!"" ;-)"
,,,,,"Our party of two ordered the Pastrami on Rye. The Pastrami was incredible! So juicy it has to be hand carved by one of the seven Cutters available. I would have preferred the bread to be slightly toasted, but overall it was a great sandwich! I especially loved it with a drizzle of mustard and a sliver of the Half Sour pickle (the lighter green colored pickle). Oh it was scrumptious!! I could eat these crunchy delights all day!!"
,,,,,Hang on to the tickets they give to you upon entering! Then step into one of the lines...grilled items on right...sandwiches in the middle (Cutter 2 - 7)....drinks on the far left. The lines (what lines?!) look like they don't move but you'll eventually get to the counter!

,,,,,Surprise my husband and brought him here.. he's always talking about this place that all New Yorker and stars go here. And ever food channel have done a story about Katz Deli. And believe me he was happy and it was worth the hype. The pastrami and corn beef was everything and more.. And let's not forget this whereHarry met Sally
,,,,,"No better place on the planet for Pastrami, along with everything else. The table service was great as well. The Yelpers got this right. Eating a sandwich here is like an episode from ""Man vs Food""! I challenge you to finish    The sandwich. I ate so  many delicious pickles and by the time I was done. I went into a food coma, but it was worth it. The best advice I can give you for a great experience is come early, come starving, get table service. You will thank me. Enjoy"
,,,,,"Half and half pastrami with brisket is the go to. With mustard. Their different lines to order is quite efficient, because it's actually making the food that takes some time - not the wait. "
,,,,,"Keep your ticket they give upon entering as that's basically your receipt, and a lost fee is applied if you don't have one! You pay before you leave. "
,,,,,"The brisket was extremely tender and juicy. I got both brisket and pastrami so I think that definitely played with the flavoring more, and added extra taste. Tasted even better with mustard and pickles!"
,,,,,"We're so glad you've enjoyed your visits here - hope to see you back again soon, next time give our pastrami Reuben a whirl!"
,,,,,Hands down one of the must-go-to places! Very hard to control your cravings when you can walk there in in less than 10 mins. Lines are long but food is worth every inconvenience. I always order my staples. Pastrami on rye with their magic mustard sauce is always smoked perfectly and melts in your mouth smooth and delicious every time. Served with picked and fries. The matzoh ball soup is my all time favorite. I think my grandmother puréed it and gave it to me as an infant! This place is special to me. I know I'm home when I taste their food.
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear that you've enjoyed your meals here - our long time fans are the backbone of our restaurant, and make our jobs so rewarding and fun. Hope to see you back again soon for another pastrami fix!"
,,,,,"Katz is somewhat an institution in Manhattan.  Inside it resembles a dive restaurant.  You can watch the sandwich creators do their work on the spot and a lot of corned beef passes through this restaurant.  More importantly, the corned beef was very good.  It was piled high as I would have expected, but it also was just better than some other corned beef sandwiches I have tried.  It is worth a visit to eat the corned beef alone."
,,,,,"New crowd, new building, new generation. Katz's is still an iconic landmark and still the same. When I was living in New York, Katz's was my obsession. I revisited the city after a decade and Katz's is still the same, like a damsel. Her beauty is static. The heavenly pastrami and the luscious Reuben are still pulling me back, whispering in my ear, ""don't leave the city."""
,,,,,My life would be incomplete without Katz's. The best deli ever.
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear you've enjoyed your meals here - our long-time fans are the backbone of our restaurant, and make our jobs so rewarding and fun. Hope to see you back again soon for another Reuben and pastrami fix!"
,,,,,"Katz's is still the same. Awesome atmosphere, luscious pastrami, and the best reuben to exist in this earth. Only error they made this time was charging $45,702.34 for a pastrami and a reuben. Since I am not Pablo Escobar or Jeff Bezos with loads of money, I had to call my bank and get it resolved. Besides that heartache, I enjoyed the food."

,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,"For the wait time and price, I would not return. "
,,,,,"My friends and I were excited to try this deli but left with disappointment. We ordered various things on the menu such as the fries, matzo ball soup, chicken noodle soup, pastrami sandwiches, frankfurter, and potato knish. "
,,,,,"Don't get me wrong, the pastrami meat quality was superb but the bread was dry and didn't match up to the juicy and tender meat. I expected a lot more from a $20+ sandwich. You can definitely skip the potato knish and steak cut fries. "
,,,,,"The employees were nice, but this is def a tourist trap."
,,,,,"An iconic location. You have to come here and try their sandwiches, they are as good as you have heard I promise! Protip: know what you want by the time you get to the front, the lines are crazy so don't keep anyone waiting longer than necessary."
,,,,,"Initially I had my heart set on pastrami on rye, but being the indecisive person I am, I settled for corn beef on rye with added pastrami. Both are somewhat similar, but this way I get to try to different meats which is the highlight of the sandwich. They pack this meat on! I don't think I've ever had such a stuffed sandwich while the price is steep, me and my boyfriend split one sandwich and each half was pretty big."
,,,,,"The meat slices are really thick and extremely juicy, honestly this place deserves all the hype it gets. They even give you some slices to sample while you wait for them to make your sandwich. Paying is a bit confusing, you pay when you leave but make sure you don't lose your ticket! You need it to get in and get out, if you lose it you have to pay a fee."
,,,,,Wow! This place met beyond my expectations. 
,,,,,"To be honest, I was not familiar with their specialties when I walked in since I'm from the West coast. When I went to order a hot salami sandwich, the guy behind the counter asked if I really wanted that. And I go, I should probably get the pastrami huh? He kindly said he didn't want to tell me what to get, but that they were known for their pastrami sandwiches. He cut some pastrami pieces for me to try, and I agreed to an order of that with mustard and no mayo. His patience and humor already made the experience welcoming. "
,,,,,"The meat was extremely tender. I'm not a huge fan of pastrami, but boy, this meat really melts in your mouth. If you've never been here before, I highly recommend it. The staff is friendly, the service is quick, and the pastrami sandwich is top notch. You won't leave disappointed."
,,,,,"Pastrami/cornbeef/brisket on rye with mustard, side of coleslaw and a plate of pickles. Cream soda and French fries in a legendary space. Lines move fast and the cutters are expeditious. A little pricy but worth the amazing meal that she had at Katz's!"
,,,,,"Do not loose your ticket...there's a pretty hefty fee. Tip: try the other offerings available, the tongue sandwich is surprisingly good, hot or cold (if your adventurous enough). Hotdogs are as solid a choice as any dogs in NYC (maybe not compared to Crif dogs). Katz is a city staple guys, there's really no way to get it wrong as long as you order on the menu."
,,,,,Sandwiches are worth the price. Usually crowded. Good customer service. You can make two sandwiches out of one. Don't forget the pickles
,,,,,"Katz Deli is a New York staple. If I have someone visiting the city, it's on the must try list. Not only can you get a unique experience ordering detector at the cutter, but you can also experience it at all hours! Katz is a low key hot spot at 2:00am."
,,,,,"When it gets to ordering, the pastrami is a must! The thick cut pastrami is everything you want in a deli to the point that I have even had it shipped to miami for events. The sandwich is massive so I'd recommend going half matzo ball soup and half sandwich. If you still have room or are going with a few people, the French fries and great to share. They're the classic steak fries that you don't see too much anymore. Once you're done eating you'll be stuffed but will have no regrets."
,,,,,Still spot on. Grab a ticket at the door and tip your god dang sandwich makers !!! Don't lose the ticket ! Need it on your way out.
,,,,,"This place is freaking delicious. Katz's is a NY staple, a definite must visit. "
,,,,,"BEWARE: be prepared to wait in line, and for a table. Also make sure you know exactly what you want to order when it's your turn at the counter. "
,,,,,"There are a few different lines to choose from there are the sandwich lines, lines for the grill, and a line for sides/drinks. "
,,,,,The sandwiches are on the pricier side as far as sandwiches go so keep that in mind. 
,,,,,I ordered a Reuben with Pastrami ($1 extra charge) which was everything i hoped it would be. Pickles and gherkins come with every sandwich order. 
,,,,,I also got coleslaw and a Dr Browns rootbeer. All delicious cant wait to come back
,,,,,Can't go wrong with a classic New York pastrami here. Prices are bit steep but it is what it is
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,real authentic Jewish food.. especially during these covid times is very important to have a place like this
,,,,,"Love that this place is open 24 hours. They always seem to be busy, but we managed to go around 5 and it wasn't too bad. We maybe waited 10 mins to get to the counter to order. "
,,,,,The sandwiches are so big that I was able to share it with my husband. But then we were both kinda sad because their pastrami sandwich is the best and totally worth the almost $20 price for one. But make sure to save your ticket or else that sandwich will be a lot more expensive. The ticket they give you at the entrance will run you $50 if you loss it. I would also recommend bringing cash. They do take credit but you'll have to remember to go to the back of the restaurant to pay with credit.
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your first visit. Though we do often serve a packed house, if you want to try dodging the crowd drop by at an off-peak hour: breakfast, between lunch/dinner or late nights on weekends. Hope to see you back again next time you're in town!"
,,,,,I don't really understand what the hype is about. I don't think the wait and the price was worth my time and money. 
,,,,,"I don't like the fact that you have to pay extra for lettuce, tomato etc... in my opinion they should add less meat and provide the extras at free charge. This should also bring down the price down. "
,,,,,"23 dollars for a sandwich is a bit extreme. I tried both the pastrami and the brisket sandwiches and both were at best mediocre. If you don't like pastrami, definitely don't come and try this place."
,,,,,"The best pastrami sandwiches that you'll ever have in your life is from Katz's Delicatessen!!! The best in NYC in my opinion. I've been coming here for years and they've never disappointed me. I usually order my sandwiches on rye bread with extra mustard on the side. Their sandwiches hit everytime. Grab your ticket number at the door, place your order, sit, eat, and enjoy! Hold on to your ticket as you will need it to pay for your meal before you leave. Bon appetit."
,,,,,This place is iconic. It can be a little pricey  but the portion size of food doesn't disappoint.
,,,,,Katz's is a very popular Lower East Side deli. They're famous for their large meat sandwiches. Ive heard several people say its the best corned beefed/or rueben they've ever had. I'm not a huge meat eater so I usually get fries and a soda. 
,,,,,"Extremely popular with tourists, this place is always packed with a line out the door. Its chaotic and hard to understand how it all works. "
,,,,,A few notes that might help you:
,,,,,-You take a ticket and go to the counter to order your food from the men making it or sit down at a Waiter Table.
,,,,,"-Tables against the wall are Waiter Service Only, tables in the middle are Self Serve meaning you order at the counter then sit down. "
,,,,,"-The front door register is cash only. If you're paying with a card, pay at the back register."
,,,,,"This is a no frills cafeteria style diner with high prices, rushed orders and wet school lunch trays. The French fries were ok. "
,,,,,We take out of town relatives here because they've heard of it and they want to go but we never go outside of that.
,,,,,"Why complicating yourselves on New Year's Eve Celebration? Why not just order from your favorite delicatessen in Down Town East Manhattan, Katz's Delicatessen! Triple platters were an excellent choice! It includes even the mustard, ketchup, pickles, Rye Bread or Italian Bread. I truly recommend this place as a must go & grabbed it! Yummy !"
,,,,,Quality stands through out times! Katz is definitively my very best choice for Pastrami & Corn-beef Sandwich . Thank God the restaurant was not closed due to the Corona virus  Pandemic. We took precaution to plead over our lives Jesus blood and grabbed our delicious gourmet sandwiches! You'll got to have it before they close! Hurry up to Katz's Delicatessen. Truly you'll thank me tor this one!
,,,,,"Since we are just outside of the local delivery range, we ordered food through Katz's nationwide shipping option, which worked out perfectly!  We requested the Lean Pastrami, Corned Beef, Matzo Ball Soup, Half-Sour Pickles, and Rye Bread.  The meats were both sous vide and only needed to be boiled for about 5 minutes before enjoying them in all of their juicy goodness.  The pastrami was as described and extremely lean.  The corned beef, on the other hand, was flavorful, but way too fatty for my liking.  Having to trim each piece down by almost half, due to the fat, really took any joy out of the meat. The soup was phenomenal!  The balls were flaky and not overly dense, and the broth had the perfect amounts of salt and dill.  The pickles were plump and crisp, and the bread was from Rockland Bakery, a favorite of mine that always produces high-quality baked goods.  The bread was doughy and soft, and remained as such for at least a week.  "
,,,,,"Our Katz's delivery went so well that first time that we reordered again two weeks later, replacing the corned beef with Smoked Lox and adding a Noodle Kugel and a jar of mustard.  The pound of lox lasted for days and was some of the best smoked salmon I had ever had.  It had an enjoyable, cured flavor and was not overly fishy.  The Noodle Kugel was packed with fruits like mandarin oranges and pineapple, but remarkably did not come off as too sweet.  The mustard was zest, spicy, and worked just as well when used on my lox sandwich as it did on the pastrami.  The rest of the items were as delicious as they were on our initial order.  "
,,,,,"Overall, while pricy, getting Katz's delivery was worth every penny and provided enough food for several meals.  It was so nice to experience a taste of NYC at home!"
,,,,,"My company had ordered lunch from Katz's Delicatessen, but the delivery had been extremely slow.  My pint of Chicken Noodle Soup eased my anxiety with its hearty chunks of moist chicken, tender noodles, and sliced carrots.  The broth was rich, flavorful, and comforting.  My pint came with a half of a sandwich, and I had selected the Turkey.  The moist meat was served with shredded lettuce and tomatoes that were sliced a bit too thin to be beneficial.  While I had requested the sandwich to be served on wheat bread, they placed it on white.  Also, we received a bucket of mixed pickles for the team, but they had refused to put the crispy dills or mustard directly on my sandwich.  "
,,,,,"So, while the classic Katz's Delicatessen did provide excellent food, their service was pretty terrible."
,,,,,"Always amazing! Delicious just like you were in New York, the pastrami is piled high and deep, and it is totally tasty. If you want an elevated sandwich, I highly recommend."
,,,,,I just love this place been coming here for many years with my family and freinds.
,,,,,I would love to bring my boyfriend back here soon.
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,"A true landmark. There is a reason why Katz is one of the last standing, original Jewish deli's in the city. It's literally the first stop I make every time I'm in the city. "
,,,,,"My go to order is simple. If I'm by myself, it's a Pastrami on Rye with Mustard. If I'm with a friend, we'll split the sandwich and I'll get a hot dog. The pastrami here is not like any other pastrami in the world. It is unbelievably tender, with an excellent balance of fat to lean meat. This pastrami melt's in your mouth. The only downside is the sandwich is $23, however, you're in NYC at one of, if not the, best deli in the country. "
,,,,,Highly recommend Katz. It's a damn good sandwich.
,,,,,"Kat's Deli...it's not the same anymore. Meat was dry and fries was the frozen type. For the price, It's not worth it. AND Had a Spanish lady barking at us like if I was from out of town. She remined me of my JH school lunch lady in Maspeth Queens. No more...next time Ben's table service. The server are friendly and juicy sandwich and fresh cut fries...Cheers!"
,,,,,The pastrami is amazing!! The cheese and dressing make it all so juicy and mouthwatering! Can't wait to go back and next time I will buy the sauce.
,,,,,"""Reuben, with pastrami, on club bread"" just trust me. Your welcome "
,,,,,"That's all you need to know. Then get a beer, they have their own Katz IPA . "
,,,,,"Always tip your cutter. That's the guy making the sandwich. Bring cash, dont lose your ticket. Enjoy"
,,,,,So we were supposed to land in New York at around 3 p.m. but because of weather we had to take three extra flights flying to Long Island then get to the city from there thanks to cats being open 24 hours on Saturday we got in just before midnight and forgot about the rest of the day the Reuben with pastrami I don't know if I'll ever have anything else on the menu because I can't go there and not order the Reuben with pastrami it's worth the trip from Arizona I'll leave it at that
,,,,,I love Katz pastrami sandwiches the turkey is good and the corned beef and brisket definitely one of my fav spots in the city
,,,,,"It is best Jewish sandwiches in NYC! I love meats!!!! If you order them during the lunch time, you won't need to have dinner! My favorite is Roast Beef Sandwich."
,,,,,Pretty over rated as this is now more of a tourist spot with over priced diner food than anything else. The pastrami sandwich is okay but quite expensive and unnecessarily big.. so much wasted food for what seems more gimmicky than anything now.
,,,,,They should have the portions and reduce prices by 33% and it will be a win win for everyone.
,,,,,Amazing! Worth the wait and the price! I can't say enough good about this place. Get their signature pastrami on rye with a black cherry soda. It's 100% delicious!
,,,,,"I don't eat pastrami very often, but by how delicious their pastrami sandwich is, I assume they're one of the best. This place is insanely popular, so prepare for crowds and hunting for a spot to sit. "
,,,,,"When you go in, everyone is given a ticket that must be returned upon leaving (this is how they track if you ordered something and need to pay). Then you stand in one of the lines to the counter, where you can ask for samples of the meats and order your food. They will prepare your meal in front of you (i.e. slice the meat) and write what your ordered on your ticket. They have self serve water, and my meal (pastrami sandwich and matzoh ball soup) came with two types of pickles. They accept both card and cash. "
,,,,,"The pastrami sandwich was very good; the man who prepared the sandwich recommended just getting mustard (vs mayo), so I would recommend that for anyone else stopping in as well."
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your first visit - we love making new fans. If you want to try dodging the crowds, drop by at an off-peak hour: breakfast, between lunch/dinner or late nights on weekends. Hope to see you back again soon!"
,,,,,"You go here for the atmosphere and not necessarily the food. I am a fan of the Matza ball soup and pickles. The sandwiches are a little much for me -- too much meat, and sometimes the meat seems too dry (but my friends who are hardcore carnivores may disagree). That said, this is a GEM and a fun place to bring friends from out of town or co-workers new to NYC. The longtime waitresses and the folks behind the counter are pure NYC. As someone who has lived here all her life, I cherish places like these. The old-school vibe is legit and can never be fabricated! I am glad Katz's owns its building (I am assuming). Otherwise, it would have been replaced by another bland condo building -- and really, do we really need to have another luxury complex stomping out a classic NYC establishment?"
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,"By far the best pastrami you will eat in Manhattan or anywhere you may take yourself! This is an old school diner style stop with real people, know your order when you get in because there's no slowing down. Get the potato knishes or latkes, you will not be disappointed. Well worth the price and any wait they may have!"
,,,,,These sandwiches are huge. Fresh bread stacked with loads of tender flavorful meat in between. My boyfriend and I split a pastrami and it was enough for us. Definitely could not have finished two whole sandwiches.
,,,,,"Their set up needs improvement. The line breaks into smaller lines, but the smaller lines goes straight into the seating area, making it hard to get to the lines further down and find seats."
,,,,,"Verdict: It's good, but I don't know if I'd go back. Like it's good to try, but it's not something I'd crave or anything. And their sandwiches are pretty pricey, $22 for a pastrami. I know meat can be expensive and they give you a good amount, but that's probably the most expensive sandwich I've had before."
,,,,,"Definitely worth the hype. We came here on a Saturday and waited for about 30 minutes to try this place out. Being that I'm from LA, their setup kind of reminded me of Philippe's setup back home (obviously they sell different things though). "
,,,,,"We ordered the combo sandwich which came with both pastrami and corned beef. The sandwich was about $21, but was definitely more than enough to share for two people."
,,,,,The pastrami was some of the best pastrami's I've ever had...EVER. It was definitely drool-worthy and just had that type of taste where you want to close your eyes after that first bite. 
,,,,,"The corned beef, however, was a little odd for me. It didn't have the same flavor that I'm familiar with. Maybe that's how the restaurant makes it, but to me it had a weird after taste. "
,,,,,IMO: Skip the corned beef and stick with the pastrami! 
,,,,,Definitely a must visit place when coming to NYC!
,,,,,We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your first visit - drop by again next time you're in town and give our pastrami Reuben a whirl!
,,,,,"It was pretty packed, but there are several lines where you can order from, so the wait was about 10 minutes for me."
,,,,,"Definitely on the pricer side, Reuben sando w/ pastrami (~$27), but  i think it's worth trying! It was stuffed with so much meat, the sando was as thick as my palm! and I loved the sauce, onions along with it"
,,,,,"Best pastrami I have ever had! I feel like I've been saying that about a lot of food since I've arrived in NYC. The food here is just unbelievable, and this deli is yet another jackpot. "
,,,,,"The process of getting the sandwich can be a bit confusing, so let me break it down for you: Each adult receives a paper ticket. You proceed to the counter which has about 10 different lines from which you can grab your food from. They will cut the meat in front of you, carving away the fat and leaving the prime pieces. The lines are very long and disorganized but well worth it in the end. Once you get your sandwich, you total will be put on the paper ticket which you give to the ticket counter to pay once you are done eating."
,,,,,The sandwiches here are definitely large enough to share and are priced as such ($22). The sandwich is loaded with piles of pastrami between two slices of bread slathered generously with mustard. The meat was so flavorful and tender that it just fell apart with the slightest force. I could have done without the bread and mustard and just eaten the meat on its own- it was that good! 
,,,,,"Now that I've tried the pastrami here, there is no way that I can go back to the pre-packaged pastrami from the grocery store! This is a place that you must go to when in NYC. You will not regret it!"
,,,,,"Have been ordering Katz's for shipping to us for several years . Usually very reliable but not this year . I ordered two shipments , one to us in Florida and one to our kids in chicago. Both orders arrived with things missing and the food we received was not good. The matzoh ball soup was so salty as to be unedible..had to toss it. The corned beef was fatty and tough to chew . Very disappointing. Will find another place ..."
,,,,,Katz's Pastrami used to be great.. but now has fallen to below average.
,,,,,"I've ordered air-express from Katz's in NYC three times, each over $100 in pastrami and corned beef. It used to be a 5 star taste, now has fallen down this year to a 2 star taste, and 2 star in quality, and 0 stars in customer care."
,,,,,Evidence presented to the court (of public opinion)
,,,,,"a) the pastrami came in thick worm like strips. Too thick (5mm) and too narrow (10mm to 15mm). Simply ridiculous. (see picture ""a"" attached below)"
,,,,,"b) the meat was tough this year, compared to two previous order."
,,,,,"c) my written complaint to them regarding complaint A and B, didnt bother to ask any pictures or feedback, and simply replied: ""We apologize for your dissatisfaction with your  most recent order"". (see response ""c"" attached below)"
,,,,,"Venerable century old place. The half hour wait is worth it. Great hot dogs and pastrami. Expensive but again, it's worth it. Nothing else tastes like Katz's."
,,,,,"Got a taste of Katz's when they did a collab with Au Cheval in Chicago, so I knew I had to go when I visited New York. But also, so many people have told me I had to make a stop there. My friend and I went pretty early in the morning and it was our first time there, so we were a bit confused about the process. Since there weren't many people there, the workers were a bit more patient with us. We just ordered the classic pastrami and we're so glad that the two of us shared it because it was a monster of a sandwich! I'm usually not a big fan of mustard, but the mustard added a nice and slight kick. Also, the pickles - perfect. "
,,,,,"When you walk in, you get a ticket (DONT LOSE THIS). On the very right side there's a smaller menu, but they also just have it up on the wall. You order wherever someone is ready to take your order, you grab your stuff, take it to the cashier and they write on your ticket. You go and eat, then once you're done, go back to the cashier and pay. They'll give you your ticket and receipt back and you have to hand it to the guy at the door, and then you're good to go."
,,,,,"Amazing food and a national treasure! On top of an incredible sandwich, the pickles are to die for!"
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,Waited 30 min just to try this and I'm not pleased at all. The hype is too much for the pastrami and I have had better. Even the sandwich isn't better either. So disappointed
,,,,,"I had ordered a ""Taste of New York"" package to be sent to my brother in law and family who live in Savannah, GA, before Passover. Originally I was told how everything was just perfect. However, at Seder, the truth came out. The Corned Beef was extremely dry and tough and the Pastrami was mostly fat."
,,,,,"The two most important items were a complete let down. Trying to call Katz's was next to impossible. Shuffled from one voice mail prompt to another. Never returned email responses to my brother in law. This was not an enjoyable experience. I hope they get a chance to read this review and respond,  but I am not expecting it!"
,,,,,"We are so sorry to hear that you had such a negative delivery experience. We never want any customer to be less than thrilled with their meal, and the package you received should absolutely never be the case. We thank you for your honest feedback - we will take it to heart and look into the situation."
,,,,,Was in NYC for the weekend and a friend told me that I had to check out Katz's for the best corned beef and pastrami. Ordered a reuben cuz what else are you going to order at a traditional Jewish deli?? 
,,,,,"Corned beef was tender and flavorful, the Russian dressing was creamy, and the sauerkraut finished off the sandwich perfectly. Deli pickles were a treat - I could seriously eat those by the bucket!  "
,,,,,"Portion size was VERY generous (they don't skimp on meat here) and easily fed both my boyfriend and I. If you're looking for a native NYC experience, check it out!"
,,,,,"WOW! Eating at Katz Deli is such a whirlwind of a fast moving, but still incredibly delicious experience. The line moves right along, and you get paired with a chef that prepares your order. You can even ask for samples, and they give you a HUGE portion so that you can really taste the quality of the meat. We tasted the pastrami and corned beef but ended dup getting the pastrami just because it was so succulent and juicy. The corned beed was also good but just a tad too salty for me, personally. I would also recommend sharing because the sandwich itself is STUFFED -- at $25 per sandwich, it makes for an easy meal for two to share. We also got the egg cream with vanilla based on the chef recommendation, which we found to be super refreshing given how hot the day was. My friend got the matzah ball soup and said he would give it ""four stars""; however, we both agree that the sandwiches were definitely five stars and made the visit worth it. Also, please note that cash payments are taken at the front on your way out, and credit card payments are taken in the back. And make sure to keep the ticket they give you when you walk in!! If you lose it, there's a fee!"
,,,,,We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your first visit here - there's nothing we love more than making new fans. Hope to see you back again soon for another egg cream fix!
,,,,,I just wanted to add two things about the pastrami for those of you have never had it before or haven't had it in the olden days but the Mark of good pastrami is number one the flavor of the spices and it should have a fair amount of garlic to each while it Hass to be salty it shouldn't be insanely salty and the pastrami cutters is insanely salty I mean I literally couldn't eat the half of the sandwich that I took home couldn't eat it the next day I ate I took a bite and spit it out and I gave The rest to a homeless person.
,,,,,The other thing is it should be really thinly sliced even sooner maybe then the way roast beef is sliced for a sandwich and so cats failed on all three accounts it wasn't thinly slice as it should be it was much much too salty it also really just doesn't have enough flavor it has some flavor but not enough and it's also as I said earlier not as moist as it is it should be and that's possibly a function of the lack of fat but it's too it's more lean than it should be
,,,,,"I would say this place is more nostalgia and Hype than anything else I went there for the pastrami and it was bizarrely overly salty I think I drink about a gallon of water afterwards and that's after half of a sandwich the Dominican guy making the sandwich was really nice and friendly the whole atmosphere is kind of off about Disneyland less than humanAnd the pastrami just really wasn't that great the Ryebread just really wasn't that great it was enough to make me not invest in the Knish or any of the other things that I might've gotten and I mean that's at $23 for a bloody sandwich I am my go to place  Fine and Shapiro on West 72ndIs long gone And it might be possible that they're just really isn't any good pastrami like in the old days And well gentrification has made the city cleaner safer and much less smelly all the garbage that used to be riding on the street in Cans is No in black plastic bags better for the smelly streets but much worse for the environment where do it where does all that plastic go well it goes into the air and the water as micro plastic , But anyway that's the good side of gentrification the bad side is there's no more hole in the wall pastrami sandwiches and what's left are things that are sort of Fetishized kitsch versions.  And thing is pastrami it's really supposed to be fatty and this  was quite lean which would be good except you don't really go to pastrami for health food and by having It be lean it made it a little bit too dry"
,,,,,"Food is excellent, staff is nice, organization and seating sucks!!!! Just get it to GO! It's like they went full retard on seating."
,,,,,"Mind blowing best corned beef sandwich. After the stay home order from COVID-19, I missed my spots that I occassionally visited in weekly basis. I had a day off and decided to drive Manhattan picking up their pastrami. "
,,,,,"Embracing the new normal, There was a line to keep the social distance and took few minutes to enter the place; the death toll was quite high at that day. The employee still gave you a sample of your order, and I put the chunk of meat underneath of my facial mask. Paid and quickly drove back to Jersey. (20 mins ride due to no traffic)"
,,,,,"The food was still warm, and the pastrami was full of juice and blended with dijon mustard on the rye. I hope I can visit again and seated in the near future. Thank for reading my review and stay safe."
,,,,,"Best sandwich I've ever had. No cap, this place is legit. I was skeptical, but I walked in and was introduced to god. "
,,,,,*plays Donda*
,,,,,It's where Harry met Sally & it's delicious.
,,,,,I love Katz!! Again this place is always crowded of course. But totally worth it and the line moves very quickly. 
,,,,,"I like the authenticity of the place, you order at the counter - they give you a sample taste of the meat they are serving you and bam. Once that meat just melts in your mouth, it's game over."
,,,,,Def a place that goes down in history for its pastrami. I even ran into the karate kid here one time!
,,,,,Huuuuuuge sandwich.

,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,"The best meal we had in NY! It is definitely a must-try. The size is big, I would recommend to order the half sandwich."
,,,,,"I've been dying to eat at this place so I had to make a stop when we were in town. I ordered the pastrami on rye and I'll say this: the pastrami was fresh out the oven, the sandwich was made perfectly by the carver (each customer is assigned a carver that makes your order), and it was a nice treat to get 2 pickles with the meal (the acidity of the pickles really helps to cut through the fat). That being said, despite being a huge fan of pastrami - the way Katz prepares their pastrami didn't fit my palette. I was also surprised at how expensive this place is ($25 for a sandwich?) and I was disappointed that 7/8 of my pickles didn't pickle and was just a cucumber. "
,,,,,"It pains me to give this place 3 stars since it's an institution, but I'm basing it off of my personal taste preference. You can definitely see they're putting soul into their cooking, it just didn't jive with my taste buds (perhaps it was the strong taste of smokiness?). I'd still recommend this place as a bucket list restaurant. Enjoy!"
,,,,,"Katz's may be one of the most iconic places to eat in the United States.  And, with it being open since 1898, it has a good reason to be.  With that being said, if you are making a trip to NY and need a place to check out, you might as well come here.  If you are big on delis and Kosher style food, Russ & Daughters is literally right down the street too."
,,,,,"I will tell you, this place never sleeps, and I don't think there is really a time this place isn't crowded (unless you go in the wee hours).  I went late on a Saturday night, and there was a healthy crowd, along with a large security guard that handed me a ticket (I made sure I didn't lose that ticket, as I didn't want to catch a beating from him on the way out, he looked hungry that night).  The ticket is your way in and out- it pretty much keeps track of what you eat."
,,,,,"For the longest time, this place has been cash only (there is an ATM right behind the security guard)- at least that is what I have always heard.  However, near the back, there is another counter, that you can pay with a card (I didn't go back there so in terms of what kind of cards, I am not sure)."
,,,,,"There are a lot of choices here, and the prices seem somewhat steep.  However, keep this in mind- you get a lot of food (one sandwich comes huge and with 2 types of whole pickles) for what you pay for.  More on that in a minute."
,,,,,"You have the option to eat table service or counter service- so be careful where you sit when you eat (the tables should be marked).  We went for the counter service- I heard the butchers here are like some of the most famous people of all of New York (like the butlers at the St Regis or the bell men at the Plaza, or the players on the New York Yankees)- so you should see what the hype is all about.  They will keep conversation going, and they will win you over.  Hell, they will even give you some extra slices.  Fill up their tip jars- I think they make as much as a stripper in Atlanta, but they get to keep their clothes on!"
,,,,,"Seeing how big the portions were (and also eating at 5 other places that day), I decided to split a pastrami sandwich with my buddy- which was a good call on our part.  The sandwiches were huge, so, if you go a on food tour like we did- I suggest you split one.  There is a water trough in the back, I suggest you take advantage of, as there is a lot of sodium about to be consumed.  I did not take advantage of that."
,,,,,"The sandwich (served on rye) was pretty tasty.  The meat was solid.  I mean, it was some solid pastrami.  I am slowly becoming more of a fan of rye, so for what it was, I did appreciate it.  Was it the best pastrami sandwich I have had?  It was top 3, overall for me.  For a deli sandwich, I would say it was also right near the top.  The pickles (which also I have been slowly eating more of), were ok, but if I had to pick one, I liked the brighter ones a little better.  Those aren't your pickles you get in a grocery store, which is something I can appreciate."
,,,,,"Upon leaving, the cashier was pretty efficient.  They also had merch for sale there too.  After you pay, your ticket is marked worthy for exit, and when you hand it off, the guy almost looks pissed you had a paid ticket (I am telling you, he was hungry that night)."
,,,,,A few things I can appreciate about this place- they ship all over (go to their website or 
,,,,,") all sorts of stuff.  Also, I noticed, even for having over 11500 reviews, I liked that the manager would comment on the reviews posted on here- so even though they are a mecca, they still keep the customer service- something that can seem to be overlooked on highly popular places.  I will definitely come back in the future, and I suggest you put this on your bucket list as well!"

,,,,,We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your visit - our long-time fans are the backbone of our restaurant. Hope to see you back again soon for another Reuben fix!
,,,,,"This place does everything right. It's that simple. Get extra bread with your pastrami sandwich, put Cole slaw, mustard, AND thousand island on it. You'll thank me later. Latke and applesauce qualifies as dessert in my book."
,,,,,"Katz's has the worst customer care of any restaurant I've ever been to. For Father's Day, I tried to get my dad a pastrami sandwich after both of our work days (we also work in restaurants). I checked online and even called for their hours, took a cab from my restaurant in Chelsea to ensure I would arrive before they closed at 10:45. When I got there 10 mins beforehand, the security guard told me they had already closed. I explained that I called to check their hours and that there is still ten minutes, and that it's a sandwich for my dad. He said it didn't matter, they had closed early because of Father's Day. I asked him if he could ask someone since they're still supposed to be open (as I began to cry) and he said no. I then got in contact with them through the 'contact us' feature on their website and got an incredibly impersonal response. Working in hospitality myself, I know that's not how you treat guests unless you really, really don't care."
,,,,,Best sandwich I've ever eaten!

,,,,,(December 2020)
,,,,,"It was my second time in my life to visit Katz's; my partner's first.  As my first visit was YEARS ago, I don't remember much about it, so there was no comparison. "
,,,,,"Due to COVID, this location has things (tables, people, lines) spread WAY out.  We got in line and ordered sandwiches: a pastrami and roast beef, both with pickles.  The person making the sandwiches was fine-- not overly friendly, but also not overly dismissive.  We got the sandwiches and sat down."
,,,,,"Be warned about a couple things.  The prices are high (about $40 for two sandwiches and two sodas), but the sandwiches are huge and tasty!   We were certainly glad to come here, and would not hesitate to return on another trip to NYC."
,,,,,Long lines beware and very noisy inside. Once you make it in take your ticket and don't lose it. Then you stand in another line behind a cutter. Some are not as fast as others. And people tend to cut in line. Should have a better way to organize this but I guess it's working for them. 
,,,,,They do offer waited service. But try to grab a seat around the corner and not in the middle where it's a bit crazy. 
,,,,,We had the pastrami sandwich. The rye bread gets pretty soggy fast. The pastrami was lights out amazing. Pretty pricey for a sandwich and wish there was less fat on it. Guess they have an upgraded price for that too 
,,,,,Confusing checking out. If you pay with cash go to the exit otherwise a card was back by the cutters.
,,,,,"Love this place. Great food and great atmosphere. The payment system is weird, for god sakes just fix it already. But I enjoy coming here each time."

,,,,,"It is a new day and a new year. It is a perfect time to go back to Katz's Deli and have a good, traditional meal. Anytime day or night it is perfect. Either go for breakfast or wait until dinner. Whenever you want to go you will find something to earth that is wonderful. I have been going already for over 50 years and I still like to go. I start with soup and might have a bagel and some lox. Or else maybe is is time for a big sandwich like pastrami on rye. That is always something to eat and enjoy. The taste is perfect. The flavor is divine. And the satisfaction is your guaranteed. That is for sure. I also try traditional dishes such as lattkes, kugel, a knish or two (or three), and more. It is all there. There is also rye bread and buns to eat while you wait. And don't forget desert. I am a fan of the cookie (chocolate) that is a reminder of when I was growing up and coming here. Katz's Deli is a great past. It reminds me of the past, the present and the future. It is worth the visit."
,,,,,"Ive been living in NYC for 5 years and never made it to Katz because I didn't want to stand in the long line but my parents came to visit and thought it would be a fun experience for them which it totally was! However, although tasty, I don't believe 2 sandwiches should be almost $50  a bit overrated in my opinion. Good for a one time experience but I don't think I'd come back again."
,,,,,"This Deli lives up to the hype as a place that you should visit on any trip to NYC. If you live in NY, it's a place that should be on your list. Def not a tourist trap. The pastrami is everything. Not a mustard fan but the Russian Dressing with the pastrami is so good. You can also get the three meat platter, but the pastrami was the best. The corn beef is a bit salty and the brisket is ok but the pastrami is so good."
,,,,,"The best pastrami you will ever have in your life..... but over the past decade their customer service has gotten worse and worse. I look forward to getting a Katz sandwich every time Im in town, like I have been doing since I was 5 years old. But the past few times I've come, it's nothing but attitude. Just came in for a wedding and showed up to get a sandwhich to find they closed their doors THIRTY MINUTES EARLY, and weren't letting people in. Just disgusting. I have loved this place since I was a child, but it's really hard to keep making excuses for them. Move on over to 2nd ave. Almost as good, but the staff is so much nicer and amenable, you'll have. A much better experience"
,,,,,"Amazing. The real deal. Corned beef, latkes, matzo ball soup- the best!  You will wait in line on a weekend evening but line moves fast enough. Confusing system but it all worked out. Super friendly employees and a very authentic NYC experience."
,,,,,"One of the best around, Located in the Lower East Side Katz's Deli doesn't disappoint. I had the open turkey sandwich with steak fries and macaroni salad, so good. Very authentic atmosphere and the food portions are large. There is almost always a wait depending on which service you want. You can do take out or dine in. If you dine in you'll be given a ticket that you need to present on your way out. If you lose the ticket there will be a fee for the lost ticket. "
,,,,,"I know they are a busy place but we did feel rushed by our server as he constantly reminded us that ""folks are waiting"", we hadn't even finished our food but other then that everything else was good."
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your experience, but sorry to hear that you felt rushed. Unfortunately during busy periods, sometimes mistakes are made - we see as many as 4000 people in a day, and it's challenging to monitor everything that goes on as much as we try to make sure it's perfect! We hope to see you back again soon for another turkey fix."
,,,,,"Great on-line ordering service, food came very well packed and preserved with care."
,,,,,"Pastrami was delicious on there seed free rye bread, along with their notorious 1/2 sour pickles. If your craving for some New York food staples, put Katz's deli on the top of your list."
,,,,,"Living in NY for the last 4 months, I knew I had to make my way to this deli. We got there around 2:30 and the line was probably 20 people deep outside, but it was moving smoothly enough that we only waited in line for about 15 minutes before making it inside. As you're going through the door they hand you a ticket; make sure you keep this ticket even if you're just coming in to take a look. You have to give to the front desk when you come out. Making it inside, we were then filtered into smaller lines - there's a front desk person to help direct you to the shortest line for the meat cutters. That line took about 10 minutes before we got to put in order."
,,,,,"We ordered the Pastrami and Corned Beef Hot Sandwich with mayo to the side. While the cutter was prepping our sandwich he cut a small piece of pastrami for us to taste. And oh man, this pastrami was soft and tender. "
,,,,,"Once you get your food, you're pretty much left on your own to find a free table. They do have a waiter service but when we were there it was about a 30 minute wait. There are also more tables towards the back and right of the restaurant. "
,,,,,"Both sandwiches were hefty with plenty of meat. I could only finish half of my sandwich. They also give you a plate of pickles - one sour and one more cucumbery. My friend enjoyed the corned beef because it wasn't too salty but still had their unique corned beef flavor. This is coming from someone who normally doesn't like corned beef. The pastrami sandwich was really good as well with the meat tender and soft, but it was really salty. I needed plenty of water after eating this sandwich. Overall both sandwiches were good but I do think it's too pricey to urge me to come back."
,,,,,We're so glad to hear you guys enjoyed your first visit - we love making new fans. Drop by again soon and give our Reuben a try!
,,,,,Not worth it. They force you to use their horrible app or website to order their overpriced food. I tried for an hour to get delivery and I couldn't select the delivery time I wanted. Then when you try and call to place an order no one answers. They have some generic message about how they are short staffed and push you back to the website or app.
,,,,,...Historical Katz Deli is a must go if you consider yourself a true New Yorker...Pastrami on Rye with Mustard and a side of pickles and steak fries will fill you up for the day!!!...as soon as you walk into the deli you feel the history and know your about to have an amazing meal...besides Katz is the place When Harry Met Sally...
,,,,,"Every so often we decide its time for a Katz's sandwich. The best is a pastrami club with mustard and a pickle. The potato Kinish is a must..with mustard of course! Though its gonna run $20 for a sandwich you will not be disappointed.  We always tip the sandwich maker for a taste of pastrami at the counter while you wait for your order to go. Katz's Deli is the best place on earth to get a pastrami, corned beef, or roast beef sandwich."

,,,,,"We wanted to try Katz's after finding it on yelp and hearing about how iconic it is. We got there about 1 and it was peak lunch time. I've never seen such a cluster to rider food. Once we got to the ordering soot, we got our food pretty quickly. He carved a huge chunk of brisket for us and I enjoyed watching them make it. I was terrified I was going to lose my tray table trying to get thru the lines to sit and eat our meal."
,,,,,The food was excellent and I highly recommend sharing it with someone if you go. I wouldn't have been able to finish a sandwich on my own. This allowed us to try the matzo ball soup as well which was nice and warmed us up. I think it is worth it to get a table with service there even if you have to wait a few minutes.
,,,,,Came back while I was in town. How the hell is this pastrami as good as the last time? Magic. This time I opted for a Dr. Brown Root Beer instead of a chocolate egg cream. Staff still super nice.
,,,,,"Brought half of my sandwich home to my mom. Would have bought her own had the sandwiches not cost $21 each. Still, worth it if you got it."
,,,,,However: The cutter did not give me the ritual plate of meat while-you-wait. I would have totally forgotten had the girl next to me not had been happily chomping away while her cutter worked his magic. And I was too self-conscious to point out his mistake.
,,,,,"I'll admit, I watched Youtube tutorial before I even set foot in this joint and I still made a faux-pas (I went to the beverage line to order a chocolate egg cream when you're supposed to order them in the grill line). But, the staff couldn't have been more courteous, I don't know why they get a bad wrap, and I just took it in stride. "
,,,,,"It was my first time having an egg cream. First time having a knish. First time having proper pastrami, it was so rich! I started to pick at the tender and highly seasoned meat and before I knew it, I was full! I hadn't even gotten to the bread. This isn't that no-nitrate Columbus deli roll stuff, this is highly seasoned, medium rare pink, crunchy bark and perfectly fatty brisket. Sliced just thin enough. Heavy on the mustard. I thought the knish would be ultra doughy, but the exterior was a crispy shell hiding mashed potatoes inside. The chocolate egg cream was good, like a carbonated chocolate milk, but it was lukewarm and needed ice!"
,,,,,"I ate in the back section where the staff were taking their bread (is that cornmeal on the floor?) and as I was packing up my sandwich in some parchment from my tray, two people asked me, ""you want a bag, love?"" And they brought me one. So nice. When I bought a t-shirt for my mom, I used my credit card. They gave me the shirt, I went back to the beverages line and paid and then left."
,,,,,"Everyone says Katz a really touristy thing to do, but the thing is...is there another place like Katz left anywhere else? Jake Dell is doing a great job at being the umpteenth (in reality I think it's 4) generation to keep this going!"
,,,,,This place is legend. 
,,,,,"You don't just get a meal at Katz's. You get an experience. From to ticket system, to the ordering process, to finding a seat, to finally eating that delicious sandwich, Katz's is an experience. And it's one I AM HERE FOR! "
,,,,,If you're in NYC you have to try it. Even if you don't love delis you need to try it. It's a must do. 
,,,,,"We split a pastrami and a corned beef sandwich. Both were stacked high with the best meat we have had. The rye, the mustard, the pickles, they are accents to the meat. Such an incredible experience!"
,,,,,Best pastrami sandwich I've ever had! I was a little skeptical at first but everyone was recommending it to me. We swung by after a night out and it was fairly empty. It probably gets a lot busier later when the clubs and bars start closing. 
,,,,,"When you walk in, you're handed a ticket. Each person will get one even if you're not ordering anything. Keep it on you and return it to the cashier at the front when you leave. If you lose it, I believe you'll get charged a fee. "
,,,,,Whatever you're trying to order will have it's own line. There are signs above that list what items you can get from that particular section of the restaurant. 
,,,,,"While the guy was prepping the pastrami sandwich, he cut a couple of slices for us to sample. And maybe I've just always had average pastrami but these slices reminded me more of brisket. Fatty pieces, thicker slices. So perfectly seasoned that you really don't need to add any sauces to it. The sandwich itself is pretty thick and I had to kind of squeeze it down to fit bites into my mouth. "
,,,,,"It's an expensive sandwich but it's worth it. I couldn't finish the whole meal in one sitting. For leftovers, just bring your plate to the back cashier and they'll wrap it up for you. If you're paying with credit card, then you pay at the back cashier and show your receipt to the front when you exit."
,,,,,Katz's Deli
,,,,,"Walked up around 3:15pm and there was a line about 50ft, got in the door in about 5 to 7 minutes and then had to go to a ""cutter"" to prepare our sandwiches."
,,,,,"Pastrami on Italian $22.95, was it worth it? This is New York and Katz's Deli is a must."
,,,,,You can be seated and be served or go through the cutter lines and then find your own seat.
,,,,,I would recommend to experience going through the cutter line to experience the New York style deli preperation. 
,,,,,"I loved their Pastrami, maybe next time I will get it on rye."
,,,,,The best ever pastrami! It was my first time there. They allow you to try the meat before you get it in your sandwich. Honestly i thought it looked like it was going to be too much meat but the flavor is not over powering. It's perfect by itself.
,,,,,We're glad to hear you enjoyed your first visit - there's nothing we love making new fans. Hope to see you back again next time you're in town!
,,,,,"I really loved my travels to New York this was about 3-4 years ago already. New York is just amazing, we have french dip out here in LA as well, but I honestly needed to try another location. We came into Katz excited to try the food. And I think the only thing I loved most was my pickle and the matzo ball soup. I was not really impressed by the sandwich maybe I got the wrong one and try something different next time, but for the price point it was not overall that worth it to me. I think we paid about 60-70 bucks for this meal and I was sated, but it's still a must go to place very popular and high reviews. The inside is cool with all the pictures of famous people its a must go to place."
,,,,,"What can I say that hasn't been said already - fantastic, delicious everything!!! Great staff, always busy, and the only thing to watch out for are the prices rising - but there's no price on great food when you enjoy it.  Keeping their traditions alive, Katz's always pleases!!!"
,,,,,It's a sandwich? Boy what a sandwich. In a world where great Deli is vanishing This is what you want to find. The tiny sandwichs (sic) will easily make a second meal. Quality Is excellent. Also a great place to meet prople if you can hear them! Love this place. Don't take my seat!

,,,,,We chose table waiter service because we have never been there before and it seems to be a place with a program.   The easiest way was to have a easier help us and he was great.   The soup was perfect and the sandwiches were huge.   And don't ever pass on the pickles!

,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,This is a place that you have have to try if you are in Newyork. It's a bit Strange procedure to order food. They give you a ticket when you get in and you can order food they will mark in the ticket when you order.  You pay bill when you are leaving out through the door. The place is big and it has lot of seating inside as well. 
,,,,,"I got the Pastrami and it was delicious and my wife loved it too. It's a staple here. I got with some cheese on top of it as well. One sandwich is enough for two people, so do not over order. It's a bit pricy but it's worth a try."
,,,,,WORTH THE CHAOTIC ANXIETY ATTACK.
,,,,,The girl with the red hair and piercings working the door needs a raise. YES GIRL DIRECT US PEOPLE LIKE CATTLE.
,,,,,Katz has it down to a science.
,,,,,My man and I were visiting from Boston and we didn't really know what to expect.
,,,,,"Well, expect chaos...but organized chaos."
,,,,,I'm into it.
,,,,,Everyone we encountered was friendly and calm and geez this place was so cool.
,,,,,Katz was highly recommended and now I see why.
,,,,,FRESH FRESH FRESH.
,,,,,Turkey was moist and mouth watering goodness.
,,,,,"Pastrami was ""the best ever"" according to my man."
,,,,,One thing to mention to all my yelpers out there is that this place isn't cheap - two sammies and one soda was fifty bucks.
,,,,,DAMN.
,,,,,But YES. KATZ TAKE ALL MY MONEY.
,,,,,Worth every penny. Check it out!
,,,,,Ps. Can I franchise in Boston?
,,,,,"This is a place I had to try out after watching a YouTube video about great NYC eats. When getting there, the line was fairly long but I was served in about 10 minutes. The guy at the counter gave me a sample of the pastrami without my asking, which was appreciated because it heightened my anticipation for the pastrami on rye sandwich I was ordering. Additionally, there was plenty of seating available, which was nice for a busy Saturday night. Now, I initially thought the sandwich was a little pricey at $25, but I was pleasantly surprised at both the size and quality of it. Their pastrami is absolutely fantastic. To me, the sandwich and pickle combo was well done, and I enjoyed the craft root beer they sell too. This is a place I will return to for sure, and while I don't like the whole ticket thing, I get it because they are a deli. For anyone visiting or moving to NY, this is a great spot to initially check out."

,,,,,"The Deli seems to be known for it's pastrami sandwich, so we went and got one.We were lucky and didn't have to wait in the line, even tough it was around lunch time.Even though we are both good eaters, we only got one sandwich and it was more than enough! Juicy, with tons of pastrami and a delicious pickle. If you are in NYC you have to try it!!"

,,,,,"I don't like to make bad reviews, especially on places I know provide good service and food- atmosphere etc. that being said I flew here to NYC to eat me some Katz's. I wanted a tuna melt at first as that is my favorite Sammy. They said they don't make tuna melts so I then proceeded to order a tuna sandwich. It had tons of tuna, the bread was great, even the mustard was splendid. I have had tuna sandwiches all over the world; I flew from Europe for this Sammy. I got nothing I wanted on this Sammy, no onions, no olives, it was plain, the pickles were even ridiculously tasteless. As I said I regret to say I was highly dissatisfied."
,,,,,An iconic meal with the famous pastrami sandwich and matzoh ball soup! The pastrami is amazing and the only thing that could've made it better is if the rye bread was toasted. But still a classic NY meal!
,,,,,"This restaurant is amazing. They make the very best roast beef. It felt like you were in a grocery store until you were give 3 slices of roast beef to snack on while you wait for the sandwich to be prepared. It was something like $35 for a sandwich, but you get at least 2 people's portion for the sandwich. The taste was so delicious that I will always recommend to anyone visiting NYC."
,,,,,"Every time I think about how Katz's is a tourist trap with overpriced food, I only need one bite of pastrami to prove me wrong. Yes, it's crazy to pay $23 for a Reuben sandwich, but it's even more crazy how f****ng good that Reuben sandwich is. "
,,,,,"Katz's can only be described as transformational - eating here is not just a meal, it's a life experience. "

,,,,,One of the must visits on my list when I visit NYC.  The line was long but it moved along just fine.  I chose to wait for a seat instead of joining the chaos of self serve.
,,,,,I love the pickles they drop of when you sit down.  I have to be careful not to overeat the pickles.  :)
,,,,,I ordered their pastrami reuben.  It is just a fine sandwich.  Mrs. K. has the brisket and it was outstanding.  Just to be friendly Mrs. K. ordered a cheesecake.  The was the only flaw in the experience. Not the best cheesecake by a longshot.
,,,,,We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your first visit - there's nothing we love more than making new fans - but we're sorry that you were disappointed by part of your meal. We thank you for your honest feedback and will take it to heart. Hope to see you back again soon for another pastrami and pickle fix!
,,,,,"It's cold AF in New York right now and thankfully the line moved pretty quickly for us when we were lined up outside. Once inside, they give you a ticket that you have to hold onto and warn you there is a fee for losing the ticket. Afterwards, you have the option of either ""waiter service"" or ""self-service,"" we did the self-service because the ""waiter service"" was 35minutes. Basically, either they sit you down, take your order, and serve you OR you do the whole thing yourself at the many counters available to take your order. "
,,,,,"Our group split up, four of us stayed in line for the counter while the other two went looking for tables that were NOT marked with ""waiter service."" When you're at the front of the counter, they're patient enough to give you any kind of sample of meat you are interested in. My friend told me they watched a lady sampled pretty much all the options. I can't tell you the prices because I had my fiancé go up and order while I sat at the table but one of my girlfriends said ordering the combo (soup and half sandwich) was a good deal. "
,,,,,"My fiancé and I split the whole sandwich Reuben pastrami, half sandwich brisket, and matzo ball soup. OMG, the Reuben pastrami was so fucking good. The meat was so tender, tasty, and juicy. And I think making it a Reuben was perfect. I would say 6/5 rating! The brisket was ok, I think I like my brisket more on the wet side, was not a fan of the dryness. Even adding the Dijon mustard did not help. I would say 3/5. The matzo ball was so good! It was light, flavorful, and just comforting for this cold ass day. "
,,,,,"So they write the total bill on your ticket and you can pay with card in the back or cash in the front. Even if your ticket is blank, because you were the one who sat down and someone else ordered, you still need to submit your ticket. "
,,,,,Worth the hype!

,,,,,"Best. Pastrami. Ever. This is the epitome of deli's. The lines seem long but move quickly; plan on about 30-40 minutes of waiting, it's worth the wait. The pastrami & pastrami Reuben sandwiches are perfect. The pickles are too. The Matzoh Ball soup is the best I've ever tasted; better than my mom's. Worth, every, penny."
,,,,,We have ordered three packages from Katz's--amazing!  We ordered the Taste of NY and the birthday packages and they didn't disappoint. Rave reviews from family--and from an uncle who has missed it terribly since he has moved to OR. Thank you for a great product!  We will be returning online again for sure!
,,,,,"Update: just ordered a fourth ""Taste of NY"" package with added cheesecake and cookies for a nephew's COVID birthday. UPS was supposed to deliver by 9pm on a Wednesday and I was dismayed when it wasn't.  I emailed Katz to ask how long the product (especially the cheesecake) would be okay with this delay...they promptly replied that they pack extra ice for just such experiences but to let them know if the product wasn't cold. The package was delivered the next day by 4pm and everything was super cold and in perfect shape!  "
,,,,,"Not only does this company make a great product, but they also have great customer service and support. I cannot say enough positive things!!  Love them and there's a great Katz's party on Lake Havasu this weekend!  Thank you thank you thank you!"

,,,,,"Once in, you are given the option to order at the counter and try your luck at finding a table to sit down. If you don't want to do that, give your name, step to the side and wait for table service. "
,,,,,"For our party of two, we shared a pastrami sandwich, matzo ball soup and ginormous fries.  Fries were crispy on the outside and tender inside. Matzo ball soup was the best I've had. Broth was rich but light and the matzo was pillowy and a perfect texture. Pastrami had such a freaking good flavor that the bread wasn't even needed. So good!"
,,,,,"Once seated for table service, they set you up with pickles, as you wait for the food. "
,,,,,"One thing, don't ask for mayo on your sandwich! The table next to us asked for it was was quickly shut down."
,,,,,"We visited Katz in person when we took a trip to NYC ~2 years ago. We read the reviews on Yelp and had to try this place out. When we got there the place was PACKED. Wall to wall people everywhere inside and out. We almost left because it was so busy but I'm so glad we decided to stay! It was a bit chaotic and the process to get seated, order, eat, pay and leave was crazy but it must work for them because they serve a lot of people quickly. Tip: DON'T lose the small ticket they give you! Just remember that if you dine in, put it in a spot that you'll remember or the bouncers they have there won't let you out of the restaurant! I shit you not - you don't wanna mess with them! Even through the chaos, strange process and busyness, the experience was still great. The service was fast and friendly and the food was SUPERB! Everything was amazing. It was more expensive than expected but worth every penny! We live in California and we now have the food shipped to us. Orders over $100 are shipped anywhere in the US for free. They ship quickly and the food is packaged well. They provide easy to follow cooking instructions and the food is still SO AMAZING just like we're in NYC. I highly recommend you give this place a try if you live in NY, you're visiting OR have it shipped to your home. You won't be disappointed!"
,,,,,We're so glad to hear you've enjoyed your visits here - there's nothing we love more than making new fans. Hope to see you back again soon for another pastrami fix!
,,,,,It isn't a fancy spot.  The tables and decor are basic. That is not why you go to this delicatessen.  When I first started  coming here the sandwiches were $ 10.00 now its over $20.00.    
,,,,,"But the sandwich is so tasty, Juicy and fresh. Spiced impeccably.  The egg cream! Omg .  This place is one of a kind. Its pricey but it's new york city we generally pay a premium for a great meal."
,,,,,This review is for the shipping. 
,,,,,"I ordered the Birthday Box for my dad. He fee up in the city and now out in the suburbs he misses all the great deli meat he used to have, especially corned beef and pastrami. The birthday box includes everything you need to ""reconstruct both of Katz's most famous sandwiches - Pastrami on Rye and a Corned Beef Reuben."" "
,,,,,"The box comes with a pound each of the pastrami and corned beef, 1/2 loaf deli rye bread, a pound of Swiss cheese, a jar of the sour pickles and a jar of the half sour pickles plus deli mustard, Russian dressing, and sauerkraut.  As advertised, everything you need to make a pastrami sandwich or a Rueben. And of course some black and white cookies to top it off. "
,,,,,"Unfortunately the jar of half sour pickles broke during shipping,  but everything was well sealed so no other items were affected. "
,,,,,Great birthday gift for my dad!
,,,,,I have been here a few times myself when I lived in the area but that is a different review.  Either way I think it's worth having.
,,,,,"Sorry folks, this is not a 4 star deli. I miss Carnegie. The pastrami was very fatty, it's incredibly expense for what you get, and we waited on line for this. They also have a sign lean +$3, and extra lean +$4 (maybe people complain so much that they introduced this charge). So I believe the sandwich was $25 so $29 for an extra lean sandwich? Really? I love NY delis (we don't have good ones in California) but this was a disappointment unfortunately. Still a good learning experience."
,,,,,"Fantastic! I dream of the corned beef. This is always my goto late night sandwich spot, or lunch.. or dinner. Basically it is a staple of my diet hence I just wrote a review for the gym I joined. I urge you to try it!"
,,,,,"Obsessed, infatuated, melt in your mouth magnificent. I don't know how to express how much I love pastrami and how much I loved this sandwich. The experience of getting this sandwich wasn't as pleasant as the meal itself but damn, it is worth it. For starters, while you're waiting for the cutters to prepare your order, they give you a quick preview of the incredddible pastrami you're about to eat--which makes you that much more excited. I loved the sandwich so much and the pastrami was so tender, flavorful, and the moist, fat slices just went with the mustard and rye bread so magically. Also--looooove the pickles, wow 10/10. "
,,,,,"Worth the price, worth the wait."
,,,,,"Katz's is famous for a reason. The first time I came to NYC I didn't want to go because I thought it was all hype. The second time I visited NYC, a friend who relocated there recommended it as a must go to before we leave. So we did."
,,,,,"Omg, the pastrami tastes so heavenly. It's nothing like I've ever had before. The sandwich is huge and expensive. My boyfriend and I decided to share one. I wanted to add sauerkraut to my sandwich but they ran out. Such a bummer. We added cheese, but thought it was weird it wasn't melted on or anything. It was just cold cheese on top. Regardless, it was so good. Make sure you eat it with the mustard that they have on the tables."

,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,"There's a reason this place is famous and fabulous. History. We were lucky enough today to walk right in and wait at a cutting counter to order our Reuben pastrami sandwiches, lean.  The young man preparing them was pleasant, funny, personable all the while working on our magnificent sandwiches.  I was lucky I could finish half a sandwich and I was sure my son would finish the other half off for me. Piled high high high on rye was the leanest most flavorful pastrami, sliced thin. Not too salty, just the right amount of seasoning.  I've been waiting for this sandwich for years and it did not disappoint.  Also walked out with 3 matzo ball soups. "
,,,,,"UPDATE.  A few days later, just before leaving to go home, we ordered another couple of pastrami sandwiches to go.  They were just terrible. They were chewy, extremely dry, lacked any kind of flavor.  Could not figure out how it could be so so bad after such a stellar sandwich just a few short days prior.  It was the worst sandwich of ANY kind I've ever had. I just realized, first time we ate at the deli, second time was takeout.  If we'd have gotten such a terrible sandwich the first time I would have taken it back to the counter and had them make two new ones. You absolutely know when you're slicing meat if it's a good or bad cut of meat.  It should have been ground for hash. So I guess they play the percentages of who will come back, brave the crowds, for a refund.  IT'S A $22 dollar sandwich, with tax that's OVER $50 for two. "
,,,,,"Upshot, if you have to have a sandwich from them, eat in, otherwise it's a hard pass. As for me, will never eat there again or recommend, not that it will make a difference to them.  There are dozens of excellent delis in Manhattan. Just my way of not supporting a business with shady practices."

,,,,,"Food is delicious and ready quickly with fast, attentive service but because it is a tourist bucket list location, the lines are crazy and seating is a bit chaotic (although turnover is fast). We had the pastrami on rye and brisket sandwiches with latkes. Stuffed so full we didn't have an appetite for dinner later that evening! I recommend it if you can go when the lines are short."
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your visit - and though we do often serve a packed house, if you want to try dodging the crowds, drop by at an off-peak hour: breakfast, between lunch and dinner or after the dinner rush. Hope to see you back again soon!"
,,,,,"Traditional food, not as good as it used to be. Horrible service. Potatoes salad terrible, latke tasteless"
,,,,,We stopped by Katz's Delicatessen and were greeted with a warm welcome. We were able to try a sample of both the tri tip and the pastrami and decided to go for the pastrami sandwich and substituted the rye bread for the sub bread. The pastrami sandwich was served with a spread of mustard and a side of pickles. 
,,,,,The pastrami was juicy and delicious. One of the best pastrami I've had. 
,,,,,The deli is a little on the pricey side. Just for one pastrami sandwich it was $26. 
,,,,,They were following Covid protocols and had outdoor seating but unfortunately there wasn't any tables available to sit in so we saw a bench across the street and ate our lunch there.
,,,,,We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your first visit - come back again soon and give our Reuben a try!
,,,,,BEST PASTRAMI SANDWICH EVER!
,,,,,"There are a lot of places built on hype, but upon entering Katz's Deli and looking at the walls, you realize that there's quite a lot of history and these guys have stuck to their roots. Although the prices have increased due to the hype, the taste is unmistakable and has stood the test of time. It is FANTASTIC!"
,,,,,"I wanted to avoid the lines so I showed up at 8am right when they opened. Once the doors opened, I went straight to the counter and ordered 2 pastrami sandwiches with mustard and a reuben with pastrami. Just like that, he started carving and you could see all of the delicious juices getting squeezed out of the hot steamy meat that came directly out of the smoker. "
,,,,,"I could barely contain my excitement, so after all of the pics I took a huge bite and it was HEAVENLY. The pastrami just MELTS in your mouth. It is so soft and tender and loaded with smokey peppery flavor. The Reuben was the same animal but a different BEAST! The sauerkraut, cheese, and sauce complimented the sandwich perfectly! The pastrami is a classic, but if you want an explosion of flavor I'd recommend the Reuben with pastrami!"
,,,,,Have to get crackin at these NYC reviews. All the boroughs...of NYC. Peter Luger's is in Brooklyn and so is Jay Z...nobody doubting that. 
,,,,,"The famous. The Notorious. I had to come merely for the novelty of it. My parents lived in NYC first starting out and my family's been there since my grandparents, but no ones ever been to Katz's. First to review! "
,,,,,"Prepare yourself for theme park lines. Only limited numbers for guests allowed inside, so lines out the door. Lines on the inside too. No ticket system here, just corral yourself as best as you can. Remember to save your ticket, cash only, all the protocols that come with this place. Could probably try late nights or early mornings to save on the line. I'm glad we found seats...this visit was 90% looking like a grab and go meal. Also take notice of food stations, drink stations. Squad ""A"" went for drinks while squad ""B"" went for food. Mission accomplished. "
,,,,,"Pass on the corned beef. Yep. Kinda dry. Nothing compared to the pastrami. 4 stars just for the pastrami. It's an institution itself. The Reuben was delicious. Get it hot, melted cheese and house made dressing...worth it's weight in price. These are $20 sandwiches btw. Don't pass on the pickles. They're so fresh...and for someone who hasn't tasted more than just what you get at the grocery, they were worth it. "
,,,,,"For a fan of that movie, worth it. A definite visit for a nyc food tour. If you can handle the lines, the busy-ness, the hustle and bustle, the City. Some other options for deli sandwiches galore but a definite must have once in your lifetime place."
,,,,,This Colorado girl got NY Katz's Delicatessen all the way in the Rocky Mountains! 
,,,,,"I received a box of food and treats as a gift from my sister...AWESOME gift, by the way!!! We had hotdogs, brisket, hotdog buns, rye bread, mustard, Russian dressing, everything bagels, latkes, and black & white cookies.  "
,,,,,"The hotdogs had that perfect ""snap"" and were juicy and flavorful. The buns were soft and perfect with some Katz's mustard. The latkes fried up nice and easy; crispy potato goodness. We had brisket sandwiches on the rye, served with mustard and Russian dressing. The Russian dressing could be eaten straight off a spoon! The brisket was a little fatty in spots but plentiful and rich. I've had two everything bagels...forget about it! So good!! Oh...and the black and white cookies?  Soft and not too sweet...delightful. "
,,,,,The Katz goodies came well-packaged with plenty of ice packs and directions for the brisket and latkes. I recommend it if you're in NY or have a generous and thoughtful sister or brother-in-law like I do who will gift you this authentic NY goodness!
,,,,,We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your delivery! Hope to see you in-store next time you're in town - be sure to give our Reuben a try.
,,,,,"Could truly write a novel convincing you to stand in that dreadful line to experience the mouth-watering sandwich, but honestly, a picture's worth 1000 words, so I'll just leave a tl;dr:"
,,,,,"Reviews on Katz's is always a mixed bag, but when it comes down to it, it's undeniably one of the best pastrami sandwiches you'll consume. The thiccccc stack of pastrami quite literally melts in your mouth with every bite. Would recommend keeping it simple and skip the cheese your first time in order to appreciate the pastrami on its own. However, would definitely keep adding that mustard to pull the whole thing together. Other highlights: the sample slices as you witness the creation of the heavenly heaps of meat, and the side of pickles to add some bite to the meal."
,,,,,"Yes, a hefty investment in both price and time, but a good ROI for it all."
,,,,,Food: 5/5
,,,,,Service/Speed: 5/5 (solid service)
,,,,,Price (college student budget): $$
,,,,,Ambiance: Casual & chaotic. Waited in the self-serve lines both visits.
,,,,,Would return & recommend? 5/5
,,,,,"Why we never tried Katz when we lived in NYC is beyond me, but thank goodness for their delivery system! "
,,,,,"I ordered the juicy sliced pastrami, deli rye bread, matzoh ball soup, cinnamon babka, half sour pickles and deli mustard. Delivery was pretty seamless and arrived well packaged within a few days."
,,,,,"The pastrami was juicy and tender, though not as flavorful as I would have preferred. But it did make a yummy sandwich with the rye bread and the homemade mustard! "
,,,,,"The winner for me was the matzoh ball soup and the babka. The soup warmed up my bones and was so comforting. The babka was not too sweet but had beautiful layers and flake. I doubted that we could finish it because it was a pretty big loaf, but it was gone in the blink of an eye (granted it took about 4 days). While I usually get sick of foods after the second day, I kept going back for more! "
,,,,,"When #Covid passes, I hope to visit the legendary storefront of Katz in NYC!"
,,,,,We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your meal - there's nothing we love more than making new fans. Hope to see you in-store soon!
,,,,,Nothing much to say. Great service as usual and even greater food.

,,,,,"The Gold standard of delicatessens. The food is fantastic. Pastrami is by far the best I have ever eaten. When you order you sandwich, the meat is cut fresh off of the brisket which has been hand seasoned and cooked. Given the volume of business this place does, the meat is always fresh and warm. It is thick by hand ss you order from a ""cutter"". Your choice of fresh made breads and house condiments (the mustard is wonderful).  The sandwiches are quite large and may be challenge for one person. The place attracts both locals and tourists of all kinds.  The atmosphere is lively maybe even a little loud. No issue there ,it's a busy deli. Found out after several trips that the movie When Harry met Sally with Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal filmed there. Anywho, if you get to New York City, put Katz Deli on your list."
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear you've enjoyed your meals here. And if you're ever craving a long-distance pastrami fix, we do offer free two-day shipping on all orders over $100! Hope to see you back again next time you're in town."
,,,,,"This is a staple NYC pastrami place. The Rueben sandwich is my favorite and to die for! We go here when we have some time on our hands because the lines are long, but of course worth the wait."
,,,,,"I'm actually shook at this meat.... I'm telling y'all, I tried so many of the top hyped restaurants during this NYC trip and I straight up almost cried when we went to Katz. It was hands down my favorite from this entire trip. No wonder they ship their food nationwide..."
,,,,,"My friend and I shared a matzo ball soup and pastrami hot sandwich combo, and I didn't care for the matzo ball soup but holy shit the pastrami was out of this world. I rarely feel THIS strongly about a food place but it was actual heaven biting into that super tender, juicy, flavor-packed pastrami. The sandwich looks so simple but Katz somehow makes it taste so damn delicious. I'm salivating as I write this review back in California. They also give you fat portions of samples when you're at the counter buying food. "
,,,,,"The system is kind of weird because they make each person take a ticket as they walk in, and you're not allowed to lose it. But anyway, I can't wait to come back here the next time I'm in NYC."
,,,,,"Best food I ever had!!! As a Jewish girl growing up around food like this, I can personally attest that this is hands down 5 stars!"
,,,,,"If you're looking for a classic Jewish deli, look no further. This was exactly what we were looking for in a NY deli."
,,,,,"There was a bit of a line outside when we got there for lunch on a weekend, but it moved fast. Everyone gets a ticket. Don't lose this ticket or you will get charged a lot of money because they won't know what you ordered. "
,,,,,"Process: make your way through the mob of people to order. Make sure you go to the right station for what you want to order. They will take your ticket and write on it. After you eat, you can pay at the register on the end with a credit card or cash at the door. They will check your receipt or charge you at the door before you leave. "
,,,,,"We got a Reuben and added pastrami. The meat is so good and they don't skimp on it. The sandwich is huge. We split it between four people which wasn't too much food. We were eating at a lot of other places though. If this is a full meal, I'd recommend splitting it between two people. It also came with pickles."
,,,,,We got a side of kugel which was really good (more of a dessert). We finished with latkes to go which were incredible. 
,,,,,"If you want sides too, I recommend splitting up and sending one person to each station. It's a bit crazy, but probably only took us 30 minutes to wait in line and get our food. "
,,,,,"If you want a deli, I can't recommend this place highly enough."
,,,,,"Well, this is the famous place from When Harry Met Sally where Meg Ryan had her famous scene. Since Carnegie Deli closed its doors (RIP), we had to find another place to try. We were shocked to find that even at 8pm on a Wednesday night, there was a fairly long line! "
,,,,,"The ordering process is fairly complicated, and I was frantically trying to watch everyone ahead of us to see how it was done (I did not want to get yelled at). The process is as follows: Get in line...Each adult given a ticket...Go to separate areas to order sandwiches, grill, and drinks...Wait for food at the counter...give the cutter your ticket and he will mark the charges...Find a table and eat...Go to credit card line to pay...Show receipt on the way out."
,,,,,"I was shocked to find the service was much friendlier than expected. The food was good...not amazing. We got a pastrami reuben and matzo ball soup. The pastrami tasted more like corned beef than I like...as if it had not been smoked long enough. The sandwich was not as thick as I expected...I remembered the one at Carnegie was MUCH thicker...I was easily able to lift the sandwich with one hand. Unfortunately, the cutter put too much Russian dressing on and the bread disintegrated after two bites and we were left with a large messy pile. The pickles were ok...I think there were three varieties (three different-looking types) but there wasn't much to distinguish their flavor. The matzo ball soup had good flavor but was only lukewarm...the baseball-sized matzo ball was really too large to be eaten. There is no doubt that the soup would have been improved immensely if it were served hot."
,,,,,"Overall, it was good, but I don't know that it would be worth a separate trip out of the way."
,,,,,"We're glad to hear you enjoyed your visit, but sorry that you were disappointed by part of your meal - we never want our fans to be less than thrilled by their experience. We thank you you for your honest feedback and will take it to heart - we hope you'll give us another chance to serve you the perfect sandwich in future!"
,,,,,Mmm the pastrami sandwich was soooo good! I was a little afraid that it'd be a tourist trap and I almost left cuz it was $23 for a sandwich. I'm glad I stayed tho and tried it! 
,,,,,(I think it's worth the money to try once considering the amount of meat on it but probs not something I'd do daily for a workday lunch.)
,,,,,The meat was super tender and moist. Generous portion size (my sandwich pic was the smallest of the three slices!). The mustard was nice. They also give you a lot of pickles and cucumber on the side so you don't have to worry about it slipping out of the sandwich. The only thing that I can be picky about is the bread. Rye bread was just a little dry for me. But nothing a little mustard and pickle can't fix!!
,,,,,The employee cut the sandwich up into 3 since he saw that we were sharing. I thought that was super nice. He also gave us some sample slices because we weren't sure what to order. Overall I'd say give this place a shot if you're nearby!
,,,,,"Note: To get in and out, you have to present this ticket you get at door. The employees at the deli counter marks your order on the ticket and then you pay at the end when you exit. The fee is $50 if you lose the ticket!"
,,,,,"After seeing Katz's Deli on everything from tv shows to Yelp reviews, we had to def give it a try. As expected the line was long as hell.  We are NOT line people but waited to try the famous pastrami sandwich.  After about 45 min in line, we finally got inside.  Once inside you stand in another line in front of a cutter.  I was a little annoyed when the couple ahead of us after standing in line for almost an hour needed another 20 min at the front to debate what to get."
,,,,,The cutter had great charisma and it seemed like they all were very personable with the customers.  We got a pastrami sandwich to share given it's enormous size. 
,,,,,The sandwich was great.  Definitely a lot of meat.  You're definitely getting your $22 worth in pastrami.
,,,,,"Has anyone tried this kosher deli yet? I'm not kosher but there sandwiches really kickass and worth the drive for high quality food they serve you with. I had the pastrami on rye bread and the meat was stacked so high and so juice and tender that I had to take some of the meat off the sandwich just to bite into it and boy was it really tasty, and full of flavor and juicy! I couldn't stop eating it!"
,,,,,Awesome as always !!!!
,,,,,This is not the place to be cheap !!!
,,,,,If your a regular like me and got over getting  free meat samples when waiting on one of the cutters lines do you self a favor and have waiter  / table service !!!  ( yes you gotta tip !! ) like I said don't be cheap !!! 
,,,,,Ask for John aka big mouth or Katey they never disappoint always great service !!! 
,,,,,It's so much easier and In my opinion it makes your experience here even more enjoyable !!!  They have reserved tables  so you don't have to walk around with your food on trays looking for a spot !!! 
,,,,,But by all means if your a first timer eating at Katz's it a must try to get in line with one off their professional meat cutters ... go for it !!!
,,,,,Also don't loose your ticket !!!
,,,,,Pastrami on Rye !!!
,,,,,Fries !!!
,,,,,Slaw !!!
,,,,,Dr. Browns Black Cherry Soda !!!
,,,,,Always a home run !!!
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear you've enjoyed your visits here - our long-time fans are the backbone of our restaurant, and make our jobs so rewarding and fun. Hope to see you back again soon for another pastrami and Dr. Brown's fix!"

,,,,,Reliable service fantastic food...new York needs this place ..
,,,,,"Amazing. Just really, really amazing."
,,,,,"Came here on a Friday night and surprisingly there was no line down the block. We were able to find seats right away and order quickly. My boyfriend and friend both got reubens with pastrami and I got a matzo ball soup and latkes. Their matzo ball soup was delicious and definitely the best I've ever had. HUGE matzo ball that was soft floating in a warm, flavorful broth. Their latkes were also ginormous and paired really well with the sour cream and applesauce. The sandwiches though were obviously the star of course. Like everything else here, the sandwiches were monstrous and stacked high with meat. The meat was like nothing I've had in a deli sandwich before. So tender and juicy and flavorful that I dream about it sometimes. The best hands down, nothing compares."
,,,,,Landmark ...a NY must ...
,,,,,The pastrami and corn beef sandwiches are the greatest..never disappoint
,,,,,Top of the list on NYC visit..
,,,,,"Pricey but portions are huge, so easy to share. Love the old school vibe."
,,,,,Katz's sandwiches are awesome!! Very flavorful and def a must have for any NYorker  we had our best time here
,,,,,This place is great when they're not selling $20 bologna and calling the cops.on you.
,,,,,Whatever passed for a manager tonight (Friday) was a POS. Called the cops on me for disputing an uneaten Boqlogna sandwich.  I didn't even know they sold bologna. Dumbass called it salami. Whatever.
,,,,,"I've been going here for 20 years. I even supported then during Covid, sending my pops a Father's Day package (which pops said was dry and not really worth it)."
,,,,,"I hate to say this, because the Pastrami is off the hook. I always get half Pastrami/half chopped liver. Bit this worthless manager called the cops on me for disputing his bs business practices. I wasn't arrested. Obviously. But I was forced to pay $20 for bologna I didn't eat."
,,,,,Do better Katz. Train your ignorant staff. Do better for a community that has supported you for decades. I cannot tell you how shocked and disappointed I am. I've never had a dining experience like this in NYC.
,,,,,This is a no brainer right? There classic sandwiches are exactly as you would expect. I'd rate it a ten if I could
,,,,,"I mean... this place is 100% worth all the hype. Besides being a bit too expensive, everything is perfect. The slightly-rude-but-endearing deli service, the free pickles, and the pastrami samples while they make your sandwich all add up to a perfect experience. I go here all the time when my stomach is feeling adventurous. It's simply the best pastrami you can get in the world. Don't skip the matzo ball soup either! My expert tip would be to get a half pastrami sandwich with a matzo ball soup. They'll throw in hella pickles and that'll be good for one or even two meals!! Save the leftovers"
,,,,,"With over 10k reviews and solid 4 stars I expected more. Staff were all very friendly, informative, and honestly good people. For the hot pastrami on rye and Ruben with corn beef on rye. They were tasty, but definitely not worth 30 bucks for two half sandwiches. House made pickles were yummy. Just wish you could have the bread toasted. "
,,,,,Cashier near the entrance/exit takes cash only. Cashier in the back takes credit cards. Self seating in the middle of the room and server / table side service along the wall. 
,,,,,"Pro tip: if your trying this place for the first time and are with others, get half sandwiches so you can try all the meat!"

,,,,,"The line out the door was crazy! We had 70 people before us but it was so worth the wait. We both had the Reuben and it was delicious not to mention the pickles, by far the best I've ever had! Amazing place."
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your first visit - there's nothing we love more than making new fans. If you want to try dodging the crowds, drop by at an off-peak hour: breakfast, between lunch/dinner or after the dinner rush. Hope to see you back again soon for another Reuben fix!"

,,,,,"You don't need any endorsements of the pastrami from me......worlds best. We opted for table service at the back. Our server David was top class. Professional , friendly and communicative. Loved him! Strange ticket system for paying and the place could do with a makeover after 100 years but Noone goes there for the dining area design. It's foremost the food and then the rich ambiance that keeps us rolling in."
,,,,,"Ordered delivery. So good - really the best deli food I've ever had. Needed $100 min and then delivery to UES was $10. Ordered 3 sandwiches - pastrami, brisket, and turkey - all on rye and with mustard. I'm obsessed with their mustard. Pastrami is an obvious choice. Also highly recommend the turkey - really tasty, not dry, and not too salty either. Previously tried corned beef and Reuben - not for me. Also tried their hotdog. I suppose the meat was good, but it was so soggy from the ketchup, mustard and relish that it wasn't enjoyable. Latkes were good but a bit too salty to me. Also previously ordered their babka, which doesn't compare to the other bakeries in NYC. Stick with the sandwiches."
,,,,,We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your meal! Hope to see you back again soon for another turkey and pastrami fix.
,,,,,"Ok, it's been said here on Yelp many times and it is so true.  Katz's Deli is the best pastrami ON EARTH."
,,,,,"Nothing even close to it anywhere, period.  The thick hand carve.  The glorious bark.  The fat.  The juice.  Served just with rye bread and the pickled tomato."
,,,,,"Yes, you need to know the system and deal with it.  Take the ticket, wait in line, deal with all the grumpiness that surrounds you.  Try to find a clean table.  Figure out how to get drinks.  It's SO HECTIC."
,,,,,But overcome the stress and you will be rewarded with THE BEST PASTRAMI sandwich of your life.
,,,,,"I got the Reuben with pastrami which came with some  pickles.  The pastrami in the Reuben is hands down the best in the city,  served with sauerkraut, cheese and relish.   Considering all this,  i still don't think its worth $29 for a sandwich I'll only come back for it once every few years."
,,,,,"Amazing sandwiches as usual. You can't beat Katz, and the food will always get five stars, four stars at its lowest. Everyone was nice and happy, and a huge help. I will say that hands down. "
,,,,,"But the three stars is specifically for mask protocol. Two sandwich makers had the mask on the whole time, but two others (including my own) didn't have masks over their nose, another two people walking around the back did the same, and a guy carrying over plates at one point took off his mask and was yelling/joking to someone across the restaurant. "
,,,,,"I love you guys, but please PLEASE enforce a better mask protocol. It was my dad's 68th birthday and I came in to get him a sandwich because he loves it, but I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable with how lax people were being in that department while making his food."
,,,,,We planned on visiting here from the get-go because of a recommendation from friend (and born and raised New Yorker). Upon arrival we were greeted by a line out the door. We decided to wait and it moved fairly quickly. 
,,,,,"We were greeted by a very tall security guard who handed each adult a paper ticket and said repeatedly, ""You must have your ticket to leave! If you don't, there's a $50 fee!"" Alright. We all tucked our tickets away safely as not to misplace them.. easy enough. We opted for the service portion of the restaurant. We had kids with us and waiting in one of the zillion lines with a zillion people didn't seem like it would work well. We waited for about 20 minutes and had a beer in the mean time. "
,,,,,"We were sat and greeted immediately by a waiter with a plate of delicious pickles. We ordered the pastrami, the reuben, matzo ball soup, and a knish. When I food came out the were out of the knish I ordered, so he brought me a different one at no charge-- nice! He later brought the one I ordered too. That's service!  Our food was all delicious. The reuben was A-MAZING. The pastrami was good, but that reuben... man, it was perfection. "
,,,,,We had a great experience here. It was different and we loved it!
,,,,,We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your first visit - drop by again next time you're in town for another Reuben fix!
,,,,,"Was ready to place my second online shipping order, when my son said "" why don't you just drive over?""  It has been 20 years since my last trip in.  Although from Jersey City it is only 5 1/2 miles away. Well. They never disappoint. We got a Reuben, Brisket, Pastrami and Corned beef sandwich.  All 4 sandwiches were huge. My favorite was the Pastrami Reuben.  Rye bread was strong enough to hold the sandwich together. Pastrami was lean and juicy.  Sourkraut sour not too salty and the dressing was thick & delicious.  Made it round trip in less than an hour."
,,,,,Don't see the hype in this. Overpriced Reuben sandwiches in small portions. One time thing and that's it
,,,,,"Normally on Sunday there would be a huge line going in, but in these strange times, I walked right in, got my ticket, and went up to the counter to order my food for takeout."
,,,,,The slicers were busy doing orders for shipping and/or delivery.
,,,,,"I ordered a pound of the best pastrami in the world.  Got to sample some while he was doing the slicing! I also got some rye bread, mustard, pickles (sour for me and half-sour for my partner), and was on my way."
,,,,,We had dinner later that night - reheating the pastrami at home.
,,,,,"It was as perfect as it gets, and the next best thing to eating there!"
,,,,,We're so glad that you enjoyed your meal - hope to see you back again soon for another pastrami fix!
,,,,,This was my favorite meal I had on my recent trip to NY! It was really worth the hype. We ordered the pastrami sandwich on rye and we were far from disappointed. The meat was super tender and just melted in your mouth. I saved the rest for later on in the night and it tasted just as good cold. I'm drooling just thinking about it. 
,,,,,They're pretty efficient in how they run things with the crowds of people. You're given a ticket at the door and get in line to place your order. They stamp your ticket and you pay either in the front or the back if you're using a credit card.

,,,,,"The only reason y I didn't give a 4 is because the line to order ur food is ridiculous. Not only do u have to get on line again for ur drink you have to get on a third line for your French fries, and the order line keeps going and going. Honestly I've been coming here since I was a little girl and my favorite is the pastrami sandwich, fries and I won't forget the dr. Brown's cream soda. The food is delicious and every penny worth."

,,,,,Greatest place for a hearty sandwich which I call it a meal!!!
,,,,,"I placed an order online from Katz's Deli to be delivered to my home in Brooklyn, NY.  Let me just say, I was so pleased and very satisfied with the pastrami which was succulent and so juicy, the rye bread and mustard were also very fresh and rugelach was moist, sweet and delicious.  I would highly recommend ordering from the different selections online to enjoy the NY experience!!"
,,,,,Delicious and hearty pastrami sandwich. My husband and I ordered a sandwich each but we could've definitely shared one sandwich and still feel full. They are hefty sandwiches STACKED with layers of meat. 
,,,,,The corned beef paled in comparison to the pastrami for me. But the pastrami sandwich with the dressing and their mustard on rye bread is a winner for me. 
,,,,,It's a little bit pricy but worth the try. It's a NYC landmark and dining experience that is a large part of experiencing the cultural landscape of the city! 
,,,,,"We got there Friday around 9am and luckily, there was no wait! It is a must when visiting the city."
,,,,,"Always yummy, one sandwich is good for 3 :-) So dont feel bad about the high prices ."
,,,,,"If you are in Manhattan for any reason, for any ago out of time, you've got to go to Katz! This is an  absolute staple of the NYC food scene. You think you have had a sandwich, but just give yourself a real treat yo self gIft, and check it out!"
,,,,,"I recommend giving yourself a good amount of time to get in, eat, and get out. You never know what the crowd will look like. Later in the evening, she slows down a wee bit. This particular time, we waited about 20 min before we got inside, not too shabby. "
,,,,,"The inside can be overwhelming to the weak willed. You have to be cut throat, but if you're hanging out in NYC the lessons you learn in Katz will translate to the streets. Walk right up to the counter and order like you mean it. Know what you want ahead of time! They move quick quick quick and you will get lost in the shuffle if you're not confident and assertive. The same goes for finding a place to sit. I recommend dividing and conquering if you're in a group. "
,,,,,"Now I will say I have only had the pastrami sandwich, but I will follow that with I will ONLY EVER have the Pastrami Sandwich. That sandwich is just so damn good. It's huge, so feel free to split it with a friend, or stranger, who cares. The pastrami  just melts in your mouth. You can tell they have spent thousands of hours perfecting that meat over many generations of sausage kings. I absolutely lose  my mind over that sandwich. "
,,,,,"The place has a lot of history and deli kitsch all around, enjoy that. There's so many memories there from people big and small and that is so apparent when you walk in the door. I couldn't recommend this place more as a place to get a damn good meal and cross off the bucket list!"
,,,,,The food was okay but the guy who served us wasn't in the mood to talk and explain the menu. I asked about to different dishes and I think he felt offended by my question and start complaining in another language and I got the message.
,,,,,A must visit when in the city. Great people and food is amazing.   Easy to get to via subway.  Pastrami is out if this world.
,,,,,"Listen, this food is good. Do NOT get me wrong. I just think it's overhyped. You go here for the experience, not the greatness of the food. The sandwiches are delicious, but it's not the best thing I've ever had. Don't hate me, just think it's overhyped."

,,,,,"Hard to believe that I've lived in NYC for over 20 years and I finally ate my first pastrami sandwich from Katz!  No real excuse for this late experience, especially since I head down to the Lower East Side/ East Village frequently... maybe it's the long lines or the other amazing food options available downtown that delayed my purchase?"
,,,,,"While I don't eat pastrami or corned beef often, I have Second Avenue Deli and Sarge's as closer options to me when I have a craving. "
,,,,,"With a little extra pandemic time on my hands, I strolled down to East Houston with Katz's being my planned destination... midweek, around 3:45pm, of course there was still a line, but not that bad. I had the nicest guy carve my sandwich... he had just started his shift about an hour earlier so his carving arm was fresh and not over worked yet... we joked about the first timers who wait on line for a hamburger or cheese sandwich... or ask for ketchup on their corned beef.  But I guess that's not completely fair, because you also go to Katz's for the tradition and old world charm. "
,,,,,"Lean pastrami on rye, mustard on the side and sour pickles. I had each half wrapped separately and grabbed a table to eat half there. $27.16 including tax. Juicy aka standard pastrami which has more fat is $2 less."
,,,,,"Even though it's a must-try for every tourist visiting NYC, it's just as good and worth it as a local. They truly do have the best pastrami sandwiches and matzo balls soups in the city. While you wait on line, the chefs will slice you off little pieces of meat to keep you occupied until it is your turn. Whether you're there at 12pm or 12am, it is always busy, always delicious, and always memorable!"
,,,,,Fuck. Best pastrami ever. 
,,,,,Better than Canter's in LA. Better than Beigel Bake in London. (technically corned beef)
,,,,,$22.95 for the pastrami sandwich feels like a deal. Make the pilgrimage here if possible.
,,,,,Don't forget to take your greasy ticket to the cashier to pay at the end.
,,,,,"Highly deserving of the ""When Harry Met Sally"" famous movie scene theatrics. This is a classic New York destination (probably more for tourists than locals) but it's very ""NYC"" in every way from the moment you walk inside. "
,,,,,"Don't expect niceties or sugar coated service (unless you're Sally). Step up (or sit table side) and be ready to order. Don't try and substitute a bunch of stuff or get creative. And whatever you do make sure you order piping hot, delicious pastrami ""I'll have what she's having."" It's a MUST! "
,,,,,"Aside from that, the pickles are incredible and ""included"" and the matzah ball soup and blintzes were pretty amazing as well. My daughter enjoyed the Turkey Reuben and I added in a salad (which the server kinda made fun of) but it was fresh and the Russian dressing so tasty with tiny chopped up pickles. "
,,,,,Delicious all the way around!
,,,,,"Yes, it's a touristy place. Yes, it's overpriced. But it's also so good! Pastrami sandwich is huge. You can probably get two or three meals out of it. Meat is juicy and tasty. It seems they have a special ticket system, you should definitely hold onto your ticket the whole time. Heard they charge lost ticket fee(?!) "
,,,,,"Verdict: regardless how you feel about this touristy spot, the food is amazing and worth a special visit."
,,,,,Very good pastrami on rye but extremely overpriced. $25 for 1 sandwich. No sides and you're lucky if you get a pickle when asked. The sandwich makers have these tip jars in front of them but you have to pick up your own food and take it to your table by yourself there is no waiter or waitress service. If you would like to tip someone who is just making you a sandwich go right ahead.
,,,,,Amazing homemade pastrami! Be prepared for lines.  Very popular place. But it's worth the wait
,,,,,"Katz is an iconic NYC deli shop that specializes in pastrami sandwiches with a classic American diner ambience. You start with getting an order number and then queue up in one of the 7 lines if you are ordering a sandwich or another separate line further down for other food items. It was about 5-10 minutes even though the queue is a chaos, but sometimes you could get unlucky and get stuck with someone in front ordering 100 sandwiches hypothetically. When it's your turn to order, you get to eat some pieces of meat as you wait for the person to prepare the sandwich for you, which is great. That also incentivizes people to tip. "
,,,,,"The pastrami has a very good texture, slightly better than Wexler's in LA, but the prices seem to be quite high. You still do get a lot of meat, but I personally think that I enjoy just eating the pastrami in itself, savoring the flavor, than putting a large amount of pastrami in between two average, perhaps mediocre, slices of bread with a spread of mustard and some pickles on the side. That's just me, but I think that it's a great place to check out just once for the experience."
,,,,,I love this place.
,,,,,Thank you for being open during these times. Normalcy is back once you have a taste of heaven. 
,,,,,Social distance was encouraged. A Mask was required. They also have outside dining.

,,,,,"Sometimes the stomach wants what the stomach wants, but in the era of COVID-19, that's not always so easy to accomplish. Especially if it's something special like hand-cut hot pastrami and corned beef. Thankfully Katz's Delicatessen makes it very easy. My sister sent us this as a gift and it was fantastic. Two vacuum packed portions of pastrami and two packs of corned beef. The same hand-cut meats you get in the deli. They arrive frozen and the preparation couldn't be easier.  Just defrost them in the fridge and boil them in the bag for 5 minutes. Cut it open and you have steaming, juicy, mouth-watering deli right in your own kitchen! We also got a full loaf of their fresh Jewish Rye (and yes, it was still fresh and delicious). Also included were jars of Katz's homemade Russian Dressing, their own deli mustard, sauerkraut and a large package of really great Swiss Cheese. Naturally there was also a jar of sour pickles and a jar of half sour. Finally, it goes without saying... black and white cookies! The packaging was also very impressive. The box it arrived in was very heavy weight cardboard, and it arrived without a dent or scratch. Inside, there is insulation on all sides, and preformed solid ice blocks. As soon as you open it, you see detailed instructions on how to prepare everything (even though it turned out to be incredibly simple). All the food was carefully packed and it looked amazing. The food was enough for two full meals, for three people. Fortunately for us, this was a gift, because the package we got isn't cheap, but despite the price I wouldn't hesitate to order it again myself. It's worth every penny."
,,,,,"This place is definitely worth a try if you're new to NYC! I do not eat beef so my choices here were limited. My boyfriend and sister ordered the Pastrami Sandwich and Corned Beef Sandwich and they said it was okay. A 3/5. The portions are here and the prices are high so I believe it is worth it.. especially for something as popular as Katz. When we walked in, we decided to have table service which required waiting and getting called up when a table was open in a closed off section. The waiters were nice and helpful when ordering. Service overall was 5/5. "
,,,,,"I had a turkey sandwich, french fries and chicken noodle soup. The sandwich was dry in my opinion.. but the soup and french fries were good. Nothing too memorable, but it was pretty good for a cold winter night! "
,,,,,"I'd recommend this place to those who are fans of pastrami sandwiches. This is a very crowded, touristy area. "
,,,,,NOTE: When you first walk in.. they hand you a ticket that you must return when you leave the store. Not too sure why they have a system like this but it is interesting. Lost tickets have a fee of $50 I think so keep your ticket! Don't lose it!
,,,,,Great classic spot! Amazing food!!! never disappoints. One of my favorites. The staff is pretty awesome too.
,,,,,Busy. Expect a wait. You can ask for meat sample first. Bring cash to tip the sandwich maker. Worth the wait!
,,,,,"Coming from California, I've had a fair share of amazing eats. However, I was thoroughly impressed by both the simplicity and quality of the food here."
,,,,,"I shared a full pastrami sandwich and a matzo ball soup with my friend. The sandwich appears to be quite simple with two pieces of white bread, mustard, and pastrami. But...not only is it PACKED with pastrami, it was one of the most mouth-watering meats I've ever had. They even gave me pastrami samples as I waited for my sandwiches to be made. It was tender and flavorful and we devoured everything in less than 10 minutes. The matzo ball soup washed down the soup nicely and added a nice touch, but the sandwich is a must try. I can see why this place is highly reviewed and highly rated! Best food I had during my weekend NYC trip!"
,,,,,"Our first experience here was a good one! We ordered the Reuben, the lox cream cheese and bagel and the split pea soup  ! Overall food was yummy but it's heavy folks, go there on an empty stomach and be prepared to feel like rolly polly olly after leaving!"
,,,,,"Anyone born and raised in NYC knows there are no delicatessens like New York deli's, period, case closed, no discussion, end of the story.  A few iconic establishments exist(ed) in the city ranging from Katz's, 2nd Ave, Wolf's, and Carnegie's. And transplanted New Yorkers to Los Angeles argue Canters Deli on Fairfax belongs in the conversation as well. Having moved to Los Angeles in the sixties, I agree, but that's another review altogether. If you're an original New Yorker, as I am, you tend to gravitate to one of the delicatessens above's. For me, that was and is Katz's Deli at 205 E Houston St. You will get a legitimate argument for the others I mentioned. Although a couple no longer exists and is only a distant memory."
,,,,,"Give me piled-high pastrami on freshly cut rye with Russian dressing, no mustard please, that's too overpowering for the pastrami, and I'm in gluttony heaven. And don't forget the half sours and side of slaw, and you couldn't find a more satisfying meal. Top it all off with chocolate chip and strawberry rugelach (pronounced RUG A LAH), and I'm back in the sixties sitting with my Mom, Dad, my two brothers for that extra special Sunday dinner. And if you're in the mood and are very hungry, you can start the meal with a bowl of heavenly matzah ball soup. Oh yes, let's not forget the bottle of Dr. Brown's Blackcherry Soda that is the perfect match for your pastrami sandwich."

I doubled your rating because I was expecting greatness and what I got was a pile of any-deli-In-the-world dried, smoked meat taste.  "
,,,,,Cmon guys you have to be better than what I had...what was wrong that day?!  Someone training in the steam table. Left it out overnight?!

,,,,,"Helped make the worst day of my life, worse. "
,,,,,"Thick sliced, poor quality pastrami that was dry...sparse amount of cole slaw on the sandwich made me wish I ordered side order as dinner instead of the knotty, dry, poor quality I'd never expect on my highly anticipated visit after an utterly bad day!"

,,,,,What can I say about the best Jewish deli in New York that thousands of people have not already said?
,,,,,"For sure, hot pastrami on rye with Russian dressing is the star of the show...the juiciest, most tasty and delicious that one will ever eat!  (Never, ever get it lean...never!)"
,,,,,"I was so excited for a delivery that I also ordered corned beef, brisket, matzo ball soup, potato salad and round potato knishes. Pickles, both sour and half sour are complementary. Everything is superb, though the potato salad is a little too sweet for my taste. "
,,,,,"Next time, I will just get a huge order of pastrami. Why even bother with anything else.  "
,,,,,"But, truthfully, everything is great!"
,,,,,"Place is good for the experience if you don't mind a Jewish deli with not a Jew in sight (talking staff here). I don't, I kinda like the diversity and the occasional Yiddish expression slipping out of a mouth with a slight Spanish accent. "
,,,,,"All the food is good. My favorite is chopped liver sandwich. Like when I was a kid. Brings me back to that happy place. Big enough for two, easily. "
,,,,,Negatives:
,,,,,"I have never enjoyed the herding method of the service system and the prices are very high, only rising as the years go by. Also if I ever have to hear one more tour guide say something about Harry met Sally fake orgasm thing, I might go celibate. "
,,,,,Go there for the experience and a decent bowl of matzoh ball soup.
,,,,,"Honestly the worst sandwich I've had in NYC, no not only pastrami- but sandwich. Did i mention incredulously overpriced? The only reason Katz's is still popular are the tourists that don't know any better. "
,,,,,"The Hot pastrami on Rye: it smelled promising but as I took it out of the bag I was surprised that it was a bit smaller than other sandwiches I've had. As I began to eat it I found myself forcing down the fattiest meat, truthfully the word rancid comes to mind. There was not a single redeeming quality to this sandwich. "
,,,,,(I ate half of one half the sandwich. The rest went in the trash)
,,,,,"Latkes: If you're a Jew skip it, no questions. If you're a gentile save yourself from the latkes that's wrapped in tinfoil after being microwaved. "
,,,,,Ambience & service: a little dingy but an experience of getting a ticket with meat carvers. People seem slightly rude except for one woman at the register with lots of tattoos. They prefer cash only but do accept cards in the back. I reached out Via email to express my disappointment and explain the situation. I was told a day later if I had kept the sandwich they'd remake it for me but didn't offer refunds. Oh well.
,,,,,Probably the best deli I've ever tasted.
,,,,,Only reason I took off one star is because the prices are crazy. But they're worth it!
,,,,,Probably more like 4.5 stars.
,,,,,"Actually, I just added that 5th star back."
,,,,,Best place for a late night meal after bar hopping on the weekend with the boys.
,,,,,Always a staple since I was a child. Love the pastrami on rye. The guys there are wonderful and the free samples never disappoint.
,,,,,"This place is a MUST TO VISIT!!!! You will wait in a line, but it's so worth it! The Matzo Ball soup is second only to my Grandmother's! So amazing! If your feeling under the weather this will surely fix you up! My husband got the pastrami sandwich which was huge and of this world! I'm a pickle freak and I got Plenty of those! I chose the half of brisket sammy with my matzo ball soup and it was literally mouth watering.  We took a potato knish home which was really yummy. Did I mention that their mustard rocks? There's only one thing...it's pricey .....BUT AGAIN SO WORTH IT and will make your tummy smile for certain! There's no deli's like this in Florida I can tell you that."
,,,,,The BEST PASTRAMI IN NYC BAR NONE
,,,,,One sandwich will fill u for the day
,,,,,"Great pickles,fries and hot dogs as well"
,,,,,Good deli food is becoming a lost art in NYC
,,,,,GET IT WHILE AND WHEN U CAN
,,,,,Get the Pastrami on Rye. The Corned Beef is Too salty. Well worth the 30 minute wat at 2 in the afternoon.
,,,,,THANK YOU Anthony Bourdain... RIP.
,,,,,"A true deli, and a feel of New York. Once you enter, you'll receive an ordering ticket. This is how they will mark down what you ordered. DO NOT LOST THIS TICKET. *prepare yourself* it gets hectic inside, lines can be messy, be patient. You then line up in any of the carving stations to order. Be ready to order when it is your turn. They even give you samples if you wanted. You can eat there or take it togo. You pay at the register on the end with a credit card or cash at the door. They will check your receipt or charge you at the door before you leave."
,,,,,Highlights* 
,,,,,Reuben and added pastrami
,,,,,Pastrami
,,,,,Corn Beef
,,,,,Hot dogs
,,,,,Soup
,,,,,"they're huge $25 heavy sandwiches, share, because its so hard to finish it all, as much as you want to because it is darn good!"
,,,,,"Great food. What else can I say. You can't be consistency. Line was out the door and still moved very quickly. ""Even sat at a special table."" If you have been, then you will know."
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,One of my favorite places. 
,,,,,This was my third time here and will always get the same exact thing. Must get the hot pastrami and chili cheese dog! 
,,,,,They also take card in the back if you don't want to pay cash. And they'll staple the receipt with the ticket so you can leave .
,,,,,"Must go! The pastrami sandwich is so meaty and delicious. It was a bit confusing when paying. You receive a ticket once you get there and pay in front with cash before you leave. If you're paying by card, you have to pay in the back."
,,,,,"It obviously doesn't get better than this pastrami (when ordered juicy and thick cut with the right cutter grabbing the non-tourist good deckle). What I don't understand - and perhaps Jake can publicly address here - is why they're continuing to use such subpar, mediocre rye that falls apart. It's a disgrace to the incredible pastrami. Just imagine: a proper double baked, caraway seeded, crusty rye to replace the dreck he's currently using. Jake: your amazing pastrami deserves a better a vessel!!! Anyone who is someone in food knows and agrees with this."
,,,,,There is nothing better than a Katz's indulgence - even if it takes a week to work it off.  The folks behind the counter are lovely.  It is great to see a family-owned deli just improve over time.
,,,,,"As a New Yorker, we know there are interesting restaurants and one them is Katz.  However I myself never been there until one day we visited it after a number of our relatives and friend from all over the world had visited it.  Food is good but service is is just OK."
,,,,,"Our server Ishmael is a hardworking man and we thank him for that (and even gave him a large amount of tip).  However he made a really big mistake, which he denied after we complained to his Manager few days after.  We paid cash, have the receipt and listed what we order:  dishes we ate in and the ones to go.  There were four of us when we ate there but only three of us were able to come back.  I was the one the was talking first to the Manager since I called Katz beforehand.  Ishmael was called and accused me in that tone, ""Why are you talking, you are not there!!!!"" And I am like ""Yes I was there, I was the one that ordered the Philly cheesesteak! I'm a New Yorker like so do not talk to me back like that!"""
,,,,,"Although we have proofs of, Ishmael denied that he made mistakes by giving two tickets where he end up doubling the amount on the second ticket.  The problem is, there is no list of what food we ate, there is just these tickets with price on it.  Katz should give us a receipt so any customers can look to be sure that they are paying the right amount.  The Manager said, that's not how they do it.  Well if they did, we could have avoided this incident especially now that with Ishmael being so upset that he accuse us of lying.  Thank goodness that we list all our food and that the receipt (which says nothing but numbers) showed how much exactly we spent on dine in and and to go dishes."
,,,,,"Even though Ishmael has the attitude, we are grateful that the Manager is very patient listening to us while adding everything in our dish.  Ishmael keep leaving us then came back with the same attitude.  Finally they both added the food with listed, even though he thought we are lying."
,,,,,The server is rude and should not represent Katz.  He took the money (tips before the real tips in $20's) and doubled our bill.  Finally he realized he is wrong and yet he never apologized.  He should be fired!
,,,,,"As a New Yorker, we know there are interesting restaurants and one them is Katz.  However I myself never been there until one day we visited it after a number of our relatives and friend from all over the world had visited it.  Food is good but service is is just OK."

,,,,,"Most reliable food establishment. If you have friends visiting from out of town, it's the place to go. The prices have gone up the past few years but you won't be dissapointed."
,,,,,"I can see why this is the king of meat sandwiches. You get a godzilla sized pile of meat on fresh bread. The pastrami was hands down the favorite with its flavor and tenderness, but all the meats could have rivaled any. There really is nothing like Katz."
,,,,,Katz's is a NY classic. There was a line outside when we arrived but it moves quickly. 
,,,,,"Once you go in everyone in your party gets a ticket, and then you line up at the cutters to place your orders. Once you get to the front of the line you can tip the cutters there, and then they'll give you your food (whether it's for there or to go in a bag). Then you can either leave, or sit and eat, and then pay upon exit at the registers. Make sure everyone in your party holds onto their tickets - everyone has to turn one in when you leave. It's cash only if you pay on exit too, but if you need to use a card they redirected people to the counter with sides (kind of unclear though - so I'd just bring cash!). "
,,,,,"We ordered the pastrami sandwich on rye (they'll add mustard or you can hold it and add it at the tables), and the matzah ball soup. It comes with pickles too so you don't have to order them separately. Their sandwiches are HUGE so you could probably get the half for one person, but if you're feeling ambitious splurge on the bigger one. "
,,,,,"We sat and ate and then had leftovers, which you can bring up to the end counter and they'll wrap them up for you!"
,,,,,"Bought the Father's Day package to be delivered from NYC, well packed, lots of food...2 loaves of rye bread...I would suggest the full sour pickles rather than half sour. Easy instructions on how to reheat meats. Nicely vacuumed sealed for freezer."
,,,,,Took my dad here since he kept raving about it. The service was polite although they missed a couple of items and needed reminders. But the joy he had while enjoying their food was well worth it.
,,,,,"A bit pricey but excellent or the quality and quantity of food you get. I always wind up with leftovers. Everything here is good. My favorites are the pastrami, corned beef, hot dogs, knishes and kielbasa. Ooh! Don't forget the pickles! Top all that with a cream soda with ice. Yummmy. Have been going there over 40 years! Food has always been good, fresh and very delicious! It is a landmark and experience everyone should have at least once, twice, ok more than once in their life! Worth the often long lines and the train ride! So take the F train to 2nd Ave in Mahnhattan and experience one of NYCs best culinary experiences. Been watching too many cooking shows!"
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,Came into this place yesterday morning to see what's the hype mind you I'm not from New York I'm from California it was so busy the service was terrible this place needs more eye to eye contact with you're customers most of them are travelers not you're usual New Yorkers so they don't know the jig y'all should keep that in mind anyways after finally waiting 20 minutes for a pastrami omelette which they never put my order in which I did tell them which is annoying finally got my food which was too damn good so I recommend it but just know it's awfully annoying when you get ignored
,,,,,"This is definitely one of the things that I never pass up when I have friends in town.  When Harry Met Sally was one of my favorite movies back in the day, and in addition to that famous diner scene, it was great to be able to get a solid iconic pastrami sandwich at this place.  I've recommended it to everyone who visits NYC, even if they aren't visiting me.  My go-to is the half-sandwich half-matso ball soup combo.  A full sandwich is way too much for me being that I'm not even a meat eater.  "
,,,,,"I always recommend the sandwich DRESSED.  While the meat is juicy, it's just that extra flavor and moisture that comes with the dressing that takes it to the next level."
,,,,,Pastrami Sandwich:
,,,,,PROS:
,,,,,- fantastic amount of meat: way more balancing in favor of meat
,,,,,- generous with the dressing
,,,,,- get a sample of the meat before you get the sandwich
,,,,,- comes out freshly sliced and heated
,,,,,CONS: 
,,,,,- not for vegetarians and not the most healthiest sandwich
,,,,,- can tend to be slightly on the salty end
,,,,,Matzo Ball Soup:
,,,,,- full cereal bowl with one whole matzo ball!
,,,,,- not overly salty
,,,,,matzo ball is HUGE.
,,,,,CONS:
,,,,,none
,,,,,"Warning: do not lose the ticket that they give you! There is a hefty fine attached to that ticket.  Even if you place multiple orders on one ticket, you still have to keep the blank ticket.  I'd definitely recommend going on the off hour as the lines can sometimes go out the door and around the corner/down the block.  "
,,,,,Will always come back to Katz's.  Also a bonus: open late!
,,,,,"This place is a NYC staple. I have been coming here my whole life, and it is ALWAYS good. I love their matzoh ball soup, and they serve, hands down, the best pastrami anywhere. Yes, the sandwiches are pricey at first glance, but it's basically two sandwiches in one. They also come with good pickles. Get yourself a Dr. Brown's cream soda and enjoy."
,,,,,"Sadly, quality has gone down . While tourists will still get a thrill out of the food, food quality itself is poor. Our corned beef was tough and grizzly and had a sour fishy taste. Macaroni and Cold slaw salad was suspiciously over mayonnaised.. inflation is hiding here by  rising prices and poor quality."
,,,,,We're so sorry to hear that you had such a negative experience - we never want our customers to be anything less than thrilled with the quality of their meal. We thank you for your honest feedback - please feel free to call and talk to a manager anytime!
,,,,,"Omg, so happy that this institution is still going strong. I had the half Pastrami with matzo ball soup, incredible!"
,,,,,Best sandwiches ever. All the meat and pickles you could wish for. Fries were amazing too. Worth the price!
,,,,,There's not much to say that hasn't been said already but this is definitely the place to go for an amazing pastrami sandwich. The sandwiches here are worth every penny and I would probably eat one everyday if I could. They also have a pretty efficient system running during these Covid times and it seems like they're taking all necessary safety precautions. Can't wait to visit again soon.
,,,,,We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your meal - next time you drop by be sure to give our Reuben a whirl!
,,,,,The biggest pastrami sandwich I've ever seen! I could barely finish half with the amount of meat they pack on there. I would definitely share a sandwich unless you're a meat lover. I had the mustard and the dressing put on the side so I could spread them across my sandwich after taking off some of the pastrami. The pastrami was tasty but I felt it was a bit too much for me. Definitely come with an appetite as the pastrami is sliced thicker than 2nd Ave Deli's. 
,,,,,"I also tried their latkes with apple sauce, potato salad, coleslaw, and pasta salad. Everything was pretty average but their coleslaw and pasta salad were good."
,,,,,"If you're gonna go all out and still have room, feel free to grab a black and white cookie."
,,,,,Yes the service is bad and the pastrami sandwich is that good. Just get it.
,,,,,"The sandwich comes with two pickles. One is a normal pickle and the other is a half sour pickle I think. I got it togo, walked to a park, and ate it there. Wow, the pastrami was amazing! See my picture for mouth watering proof."
,,,,,"This place is definitely worth a stop, especially if you're from out of town."
,,,,,I felt like I liked the place but it's overrated overpriced I had a sandwich only meat in it and it was dried. Cost me a lot.
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,Never responded to repeated requests via phone and email why my order was partially filled. They totally ignored all of my inquiries.  Would not ever use them
,,,,,Food is amazing. Great customer service. A New York staple. Don't let long line discourage you. They move fast and efficienct. They let you taste meat before you decide what you want. The place is a historic landmark for sure. Not to mention they are open all night on Friday and Saturday
,,,,,Best Jewish Deli in NYC? Yes. End of story. No fights. Don't believe me? Order the pastrami and cry in happiness.
,,,,,"Cool, touristy experience that is worth the trip and wait for people traveling to NYC. The restaurant itself is special with its display of its personal long history. The pastrami is incredible...best I have ever had. The sandwich is enormous and can easily serve two people. Staff all very polite."
,,,,,My mom picked up a Noodle Pudding because we were nearby. I didn't care for it much but she liked it. Large piece for $8
,,,,,A new york institution serving delicious sandwiches. Have to go with the classic hot pastrami on rye with mustard. An absolute PILE of tender meat. Perfect late night food as well! Love their homemade pickles.
,,,,,"Expensive, yes. If you're going to penny pinch, don't go. Pastrami and a can of soda was just about $30. The best sandwich you will ever get. I had to fast for surgery starting the next morning. With this as lunch, it was more than 48 hours before I ate again.....and wasn't hungry. Round trip I walked 74 blocks, just under 5 miles, paid a fortune and still was happy as a pig in slop. Note, if you going to get a chicken salad or any sandwich that isn't pastrami or corned beef, go somewhere else."
,,,,,"Meat！Meat！Meat！All I can see is MEAT！The portion is not just big, I would say it's HUGE. Hope I will have chance to visit again."
,,,,,"I wanted to try it since it is quite famous. Luckily I went on a Tuesday and got there around 1. It was getting quite busy but the line wasn't too long. You get to try a piece of the pastrami while waiting for your sandwich. It was tender and juicy. There was just the right amount of fat, and they give a very generous portion of meat. With the mustard and the pickles to cut the savouriness it was amazing. You can't stop eating it and it does fill you up. However the price of this is around $24, which isn't worth it for a single sandwich. A tip you can do is order extra bread and make it into two meals since there is so much pastrami."
,,,,,It took a while to get into the place. It reminded me of a scene from TV show Seinfield.  First the door guy gives you a ticket. Then you'll have to step up to the guy making the sandwiches and tell them what we wanted. 
,,,,,The places is pricey. It could use a little updating. One guy did something unsanitary and we made sure we didn't go to him. 
,,,,,"My wife and I had the Rueben sandwich didn't have a lot of sauce. However, the meat was tender and delicious. In fact, it was the best pastrami I have ever had. The bread became so soggy that the sandwiches broke a part."
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,"We had a lackluster food experience. It was pretty dry and the fact the meat is stacked only made the dry meat worse. The potato pancakes were a bit too oily, but still tasty. I'm not sure if it's because we came early in the day, but the experience was not worth the cost of the meal. I want to believe it's the most amazing sandwich, but if consistency is an issue I'm not sure if I'd return to take the chance."
,,,,,"Very good sandwiches, full of meat and toppings.  They will make a fat kid out of anyone who can eat the whole thing in 1 sitting"
,,,,,Hands down best Pastrami Sammy in all the Boroughs. Don't even play yourself going elsewhere.
,,,,,"This sandwich place just revived my social distancing... completely deserves all the stars I just gave it. To think I didn't even have this sandwich at it's BEST. I will be going back after the lock down to try it in person and not having to warm it up again. I got a regular salami sandwich. The meat inside was cooked perfectly. It tasted like salami, but it felt like brisket! It was so moist and tender. It makes me want to go back and try everything in the menu. I really never think to take pictures of takeout food so I don't have any shots. But I will update my review when I order here again! "
,,,,,10/10 will recommend.
,,,,,The greatest sandwich on earth. The pastrami seems to be the crowd favorite. The rueben too. The cost $25 is worth it. They have it right. I'm hungry now....
,,,,,Good quality food every time. Great service. Can't wait to visit again. Great pandemic protocol. Everyone follow the rules concerning the pandemic. Partition at every booth for extra protection.
,,,,,"Three words: corned beef hash. This is by far the best I've ever had. The meat is so tender.. and you have to order it ""Reuben style"". They do not skimp on the meat .. at all! I can usually only finish 1/2."
,,,,,"So let me back up and talk about the experience. When you walk in, it is pure chaos - people everywhere, restaurant employees yelling at you to keep moving lol but they have a good system. They have multiple lines and you pick whichever one you want .. shortest obviously. But have a general idea of what you want too - they like to keep things moving. If you want to sample the meat they will gladly slice a piece and pass to you on a saucer while they prep your food. Then you get a ticket and head off to find a seat while you wait for sides you may have ordered, like French fries."
,,,,,Before you head to the exit you pay at the back of the restaurant and keep your receipt as they will not let you exit until it has been checked.
,,,,,"This is a must try on every visit to NY, I have even ordered one to go to enjoy when I returned back home. It was good, but there is nothing like eating one of their sandwiches made fresh."
,,,,,"Excellent pastrami!!!! Love this place, I come all the time, it's a must see when in the city"
,,,,,I'll just give it 5 stars because it's Katz's
,,,,,We took a photo with the owner yes !!!!!
,,,,,I've only been here during COVID and the seats are all very spaced out. I'm sure post and pre COVID it's super busy here. Truly a piece of New York culture that should never disappear.
,,,,,"Ohh yea, the sandwich was obviously good!"
,,,,,Amazing! We walked up and the line was out the door and down the street. We asked the person upfront how long they had waited and it was only 5 min. They have a quick and fast service! I want more.
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,"This is the famous ""when Harry met sally"" restaurant. The sandwiches are huge so we ordered the half sandwich with soup combo. The split pea soup is amazing. The matzo ball soup is a bit salty though. It's def over the hype but I guess must try restaurant if you are in nyc."
,,,,,Excellent pastrami sandwiches with incredible side dishes/soups. Worth the wait and I had a great experience here. The meat melts in your mouth and is extremely tender. This restaurant has been reviewed a ton so I have nothing new to add; be sure to hang onto your ticket.
,,,,,Legendary jewish deli that serves the best pastrami sandwich on rye in NYC!! 
,,,,,"I have been going to Katz's for over 10+ years but decided to finally put my love for this place in writing. When you walk in, checkout the walls filled with photos of all the famous people who has flocked here."
,,,,,The sandwiches aren't cheap but it can be shared between two...that's if you would actually want to share. The corned beef and pastrami is cured using a slower method compared to commercially prepared meats. Katz's corned beef and pastrami takes about 30 days to cure. The best cut of meat that's perfectly juicy and full of character.
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear that you've enjoyed your meals here - our long time fans are the backbone of our restaurant, and make our jobs truly rewarding and fun. Hope to see you back again soon for another pastrami fix!"
,,,,,"Disgusting food served in a disgusting way in a hovel of a place where the ambiance is disgusting. Maybe it had something at some point in time but I wouldn't eat here again if u paid me. The pastrami 4/10, the bread 2/10, the pickle 3/10. Sorry but I tried too many places to tolerate such garbage"
,,,,,"Had the Matzo ball soup for the first time. It was decent, hot, fresh, flavorful, but straightforward nothing fancy. The potato latkes were very good, fresh, made to order. The iced tea was also great, one of favorites there. Didn't try a sandwich but everything was made fresh right in front of you. And also this place is kinda expensive given the name and reputation so expect to hand over some serious cash. And also they have a ticket thing they do, they also don't itemize on the bill which means you could potentially get overcharged because it doesn't show you what you ordered, so it's not the most effective system of payment. Also different lines for what you want, lots of lines, could be confusing but hey it's New York right??!!!"
,,,,,Great place and a New York classic. I went to visit with my friends and they also loved the place
,,,,,"They're a NYC staple for a reason. The pastrami is delicious no matter which location you go to. Worth noting, the sandwiches come STACKED with meat, so you could probably feed two people with one sandwich."
,,,,,"The best deli on the planet. I will say though, the last time I was there (3 weeks ago)  I did have some pastrami that was a little too old but I won't let that stop me from going next time I'm in NYC"
,,,,,An NYC staple. We love the pastrami sandwich and my grandpa requests I bring him 2lbs of Katz's hot dogs and bring them to Philadelphia. They are fabulous & slightly spicy.
,,,,,"Knowing how packed Katz's usually is, we decided to order for carry out and I am SO glad we did. After placing our order online on the way to SoHo, the pick up time was about an hour away, so we wandered around the area until it was time to pick up. Pick up was super smooth, we were in and out in under 5 minutes and then ate at their outdoor tables. We got the Reuben with pastrami and potato salad (fries in the image are from a different restaurant, sorry) and both were great! My husband and I split the sandwich because it was so massive with a TON of pastrami. I'm typically a mustard-based potato salad fan, but Katz's might have converted me - so creamy and yummy! This place is a must if visiting NY."
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,All my life I have been intimidated by this place and have always said to myself that there is no way a sandwich should be $20+ but when I finally tried this place ever single past thought negative thought left my head. The brisket is literally to die for and the way it just works with the rye bread and lather of mustard. Overhype blah blah no way this it a must have!
,,,,,We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your first visit - there's nothing we love more than making new fans. Hope to see you back again soon for another brisket fix!

,,,,,This is one of my top favorite restaurants I have been to in New york. The pastrami sandwich is to die for. Highly recommend.This is one of my top favorite restaurants I have been to.
,,,,,"Delicious!! Amazing pastrami! Got the half matzoh ball soup and half lean pastrami sandwich. The soup had one large matzoh ball in a pint sized container with carrots and celery in it. Decent soup with the sandwich. Different than some other chicken based matzoh ball soups I've had though, which was yellowish broth vs this brownish broth."
,,,,,"The pastrami is the star. Extremely delicious and moist, even the lean pastrami when it's hot. It's dry a little bit when it cools, but still very good. Great option if you're trying to avoid dripping oozing oiliness. It's not as dry as chicken breast meats. The tomato and heaping lettuce gives the pastrami a good balance of meat and some veggies."
,,,,,The broccoli knish was good. Great side to the pastrami sandwich. I prefer the round knish over the square potato knish. The potato knish taste like most potato knishes.
,,,,,Portions are huge. Shareable or save some for later.
,,,,,Glad this place delivers. It's on 
,,,,," and can be scheduled. They do have a minimum but it's easy to reach with a combo of 1-2 pounds of meat, couple sandwiches, some knishes. Best part is not waiting to wait in line for this amazing food and helping small business at this time."
,,,,,"Great place love their pastrami on rye bread, I can't imagine going anywhere else but Katz"
,,,,,So delicious! I heard about this place when touring the One World Observatory. I would definitely come back again. I had the pastrami sandwich!
,,,,,I went to Katz's Deli specifically for pastrami. I bought a whole pound. It was ridiculously expensive - $35.00 - but worth every penny. Good pastrami isn't something you can buy in any deli. It really needs to be a Jewish deli - at least in New York it does. The meat has to be spiced and cooked for hours and then served from a steamer. This was wonderful and ended up being 4 sandwiches.
,,,,,"Even if the food had been total crap (which it def was not) the staff alone would have made it amazing, everyone was super nice and helpful, the food was delicious and the whole experience was really good. Glad we made this a stop while visiting NYC."
,,,,,"Katz's Deli was recommended by a relative of mine who was living in the city.  I tried it for the first time a few years ago.  On our NYC trip last summer, we made it a priority to stop here at this famous sandwich spot.  With over 12,000 Yelp reviews already, there's not much left to praise about Katz's.  "
,,,,,"We arrived on a random weekday during lunch and expected a large crowd.  Once you enter, they give every customer a ticket.  Hang on to that ticket because they will ask for it when you exit.  If it's your first time here, it will seem chaotic.  But, its quite organized with multiple lines to place an order.  After that proceed to cashier.  Your number will be called when order is ready.  "
,,,,,"The restaurant is large so don't worry about finding a table.  The customers are in and out really quickly.  Well, it's NY so everything is fast paced.  We were able to find a table for 3 during rush hour.  You may have to share a table with others since it's super crowded.  We liked that since it was nice chatting with the locals.  "
,,,,,The order was ready in about 15-20 minutes considering how packed it was at that time.  Of course we all ordered the infamous pastrami sandwiches.  The best sandwich you will ever have in the states!  The meat is so tender!  It is piled high on your choice of bread.  You have the option to add mustard or cheese.  
,,,,, Katz's sets the bar above and beyond for other local delis.  They have been around for over 100 year so you know none can compare!

,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,"This was a restaurant that was highly recommended to me when I came to New York a while ago. Since New York is known pretty well for their delis within the US, we wanted to go to one of the most well-known delis to check it out. The interior is decently sized, although it was pretty packed when we went and we had to wait a while. You could tell that there was a lot of media coverage for the place, since even while we were there we saw a news channel getting footage of the restaurant. The place is quite pricey for a sandwich, with one sandwich costing $23 so it's not something many people can afford to go to everyday."
,,,,,"    My friends and I got the signature Katz's pastrami sandwich, and although I don't have pastrami often I have to say that this is the best that I've had so far! The pastrami meat is super juicy and melts on your tongue, with every bite being really flavorful. The mustard and other sauces they add also complement the meat well to enhance the taste. Each sandwich comes pretty stuffed with pastrami, so you don't have to worry about them skimping out on it."
,,,,,"    Overall, I would recommend checking this place out at least once if you're ever in New York for the experience of a top-tier deli! It's pretty pricey to come regularly, but it's definitely well-known for a good reason!"
,,,,,"Update: got the knoblewurst. At $8.95 it's a little more than I like to spend on a sausage sandwich. It's no better, probably a little worse than similar ones in eastern european areas of the states like pittsburgh, pennsylvania or pittsfield, connecticut. Katz's bread is notoriously stale but the mustard is the best of standards and so too is the sauerkraut. The knoblewurst is just like you'd have at a backyard BBQ - garlicky, salty, plump, and juicy. I'm sticking with the hot dog, though, if I don't get the pastrami for now on... "
,,,,,"That being said, it's still Katz's; just like sex, I'm happy simply to be in the room."
,,,,,Let's do a rundown of stuff to get:
,,,,,FOOD 
,,,,,"Pastrami - obligatory. On rye, with mustard. It's spicy and it's juicy and you really gotta get it. Although I have recently been questioning if something is different bc it tastes like there's some preservative change going on. Maybe they got too big. "
,,,,,Tongue - Would be so much better if it was not cold. I'm not into it. 
,,,,,"Corned beef - less spicy than a pastrami. I don't know, I have had it but can't do it again. "
,,,,,Hot dog - one of the best in NYC. I had never gotten it until recently. Now I really want to try the knoblewurst and the knockwurst because this may relieve me of the must of the pastrami. 
,,,,,Latkes - Great crisp and creamy version! Comes with both sour cream and applesauce like a proper non-kosher deli should. 
,,,,,French fries - they don't make them to order so you can't get them well done. I don't appreciate steak fries unless they are well done. Someone always wants to get them but I've never really been glad we did. 
,,,,,Stuffed derma - it's one of my favorite Jewish dishes. Theirs here is nothing special but it's appreciated. 
,,,,,"Future orders - brisket, matzo ball soup, knockwurst, knoblewurst. "
,,,,,DRINKS
,,,,,"Egg cream - Classic and good. If you've never had it, this is a good place to try and decide if you like it. I don't even think I like egg creams but I get it about twice-a-year around town. (there IS a Vietnamese drink with egg yolk, seltzer, and condensed milk that tastes how an egg cream SHOULD taste). "
,,,,,"Doc Brown's CelRay - celery soda, classic to the Jewish Deli. It's good and fine. "
,,,,,They actually serve a bunch of beer here. I never got it though.
,,,,,"Pastrami sandwich, I want to tell you I love you, I have always loved you, and before I even knew you I was destined to love you; when I die I only want to lie next to you. Forever."
,,,,,"I felt the height of our love at Katz's. I have never been so blown away by a sandwich like you before. You gave me so many new flavors and feelings I never knew could come out of warm slices of meat like you. I've grown so much with you in the time we've been together. I feel like I would be a completely different person if I never met you. Every time I pass by Katz's, I only think of you."
,,,,,Something has been coming over me over the past year. I became a bit curious to what else is out there. Please do not think that you were insufficient in anything you have done for me. I utterly love you. Here is my confession: I wanted to try another sandwich and I did.
,,,,,"Beef tongue is a good friend of yours, I know. The man at the counter questioned me if I knew what I was doing, ""It's cold, you know."" I took a taste and even though it didn't feel quite right, I went through with it. I thought about you the whole time I was ordering. I must have thought your name a thousand times from the time I entered to when I sat down with my surrogate family. I stopped thinking when I took my first bite. I thought it would be an unfair comparison and would show disrespect to both of you. I will not go into details, but when I finished, I looked at my plate and thought about the mistake I made."
,,,,,"If you never want to see me or beef tongue again I understand. Please know that I love you. You are everything and I will never be interested in another sandwich. Katz Deli Pastrami, forget that soldier you were sent to. No man will ever love you half as much as I do. I only want you."
,,,,,.
,,,,,.
,,,,,.
,,,,,"Maybe we can mix it up with your friend matzoh ball next time? or that vixen french fries?? Only if you are there though. Look, honestly I would be happy just to watch. What do you think? I'm not that interested in hot dog but if that's what you want, that's fine. I love you Pastrami Sandwich."
,,,,,"Amazing! This place is a must go to while In NYC! Pricey, but I would totally pay it again! We actually met the owner while enjoying our food next to him and his family!"
,,,,,"Delicious and worth the wait ~ the meats were warm! As a tourist, my friend heard great things about this place. We had no idea how the pay system worked but everyone was kind enough to let us know that our tickets had to be updated and pay at the entrance when you finish eating. I would definitely go again!"
,,,,,"When I went last Friday, there was a line of approximately 8 people in front of me outside and there's a line inside but it was relatively quick. Before you go in the guy manning the door will give you a ticket and you need to make sure you don't lose the ticket as it will be used during the order and during check out when you pay. The wait probably took approximately 20 minutes. There are plastic dividers between each ordering station and there are approximately 4 order stations. Everyone working there are wearing masks and the guy behind the ordering station was nice and let me sample the pastrami. I ordered the 1/2 pastrami on rye sandwich and a matzo ball soup. The combo is approximately $22. It is a little on the pricey side. Please note that they stuff a lot of pastrami in the rye sandwich, stacked pretty high, and I had a full sandwich before at the DeKalb location and that was way too much meat. 1/2 a sandwich was a better portion for me to share with someone else. I also never had a matzo ball soup before so I was kind of excited to try it here. It was slightly on the salty side and the ball/soup tasted a bit like vegetable soup. It's a decent soup but it is not a favorite of mine."
,,,,,The Best Reuben and Pastrami Sandwiches EVER. It's worth the wait in line. Make it a date night or a quick lunch.
,,,,,Camedown on lunch break for a Pastrami Sandwich and a Corned Beef Sandwich. Too bad they don't deliver.
,,,,,Very disappointing! 
,,,,,"A dear friend sent my husband a Katz Deli care package of corned beef, pastrami and a half loaf of rye for his birthday. The photos represent 80% of the corned beef...the slices were thick and so grizzly that they stretched like rubber bands and didn't come apart. The other 20% was salvageable...what a horrible way to describe one of life's most delicious foods. "
,,,,,"The pastrami was much better thank goodness but I'm afraid the rye wasn't fresh considering it was packaged bread, which normally has a longer shelf life bc of the preservatives. "
,,,,,Not impressed Katz.
,,,,,"All sandwiches are not created equal, depending on the cutter, you will either get an insane amount of meat or just average. We got unlucky and got an average sandwich, added Swiss cheese for $1, pass on the Mac salad at $7.45 it's just regular store bought watery mac salad nothing special. Our pastrami was a little on the dry side, but it was an acceptable filling meal. Line moves pretty quick, the drink and sides guy was kinda rude, and you have to ask for a fork at the counter, I saw multiple people who clearly ordered sides have to go up and ask for one. Leave them out so people can grab or give them to people who order sides."
,,,,,"Well let me put it this way, i always used to get my pastrami or corn beef sandwich from 2nd Avenue deli.  So now, i am happened to be driving by Kat's and i had a sudden hankering for pastrami.  Needless to say that I should have checked price before ordering since so as to avoid sticker shock.   There was a short line to place order, you can pay cash or credit and within 15 minutes my order was ready, after all it was 12:30pm, so considering the line and wait was rather quick.  $33 lunch is definitely not in my budget, specially for a sandwhich and french fries.  So while lunch was delicious, i should have stuck to what i had originally planned.  We live in difficult times so i doubt people in NYC can afford to eat lunch at Katz all the time.  This was my first time and most likely while the food was good, i will go somewhere else just because of budget."
,,,,,"Have you ever seen a better looking sandwich? The correct answer is: No. it is so good, it is simple but a classic."
,,,,,"My favorite part of the experience is when you go up to the counter to order they let you try a piece of the pastrami as they are making your sandwich, let me tell you that once you try that you are dying for a bite of your sandwich! "
,,,,,"This is a famous sandwich for a reason, and their homemade pickles are amazing!!! "
,,,,,"Make sure to come early as the lines get really long, but well worth the wait!"

,,,,,Love this page. Best sandwiches. Such a foodie and def a fave. Long lines are a miss but going at the right time will certainly get you in quick.
,,,,,Second time to this place... once again food was delicious.   We had the pastrami and brisket..  can't say I have ever had better!  The staff are all pleasant and fast. Over all a good experience!  Thank you Katz Deli
,,,,,We're so glad that you've enjoyed your visits here - there's nothing we love more than making new fans. Hope to see you back again soon for another pastrami and brisket fix!
,,,,,It's a place with a reputation and the food is impressive. It's an odd style of cafeteria deli meats. We got the pastrami sandwich which was plenty for 2 ppl. I would say the meat gets a little overwhelming and it's a pricey sandwich so be prepared to spend even for a single sandwich.
,,,,,Food and service was fantastic. Best pastrami I've ever had and the chicken noodle soup was the best. will definitely come back here. highly recommended.
,,,,,We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your first visit - there's nothing we love more than making new fans. Drop by again next time you're in town and give our Reuben a whirl!
,,,,,This place is amazing! Everything I've ever gotten here has been fresh and incredible! I always look forward to coming here!
,,,,,"Really not a fan of the ticketing system. Went to Katz for the first time so my husband and I weren't aware of how the system worked. We walked through the door and were handed 2 tickets, one for each of us, but weren't explained what the tickets were for. We shared a sandwich so the counter guy only wrote on one ticket and I had no idea I was supposed to keep the blank ticket so I crumpled it up and tossed it on the plate with our finished meal. When we tried to leave, we presented the ticket with our paid receipt and were"
,,,,,asked for my ticket. I told them I had thrown it away since I didn't know and they told me I'd have to go through the trash and find it. In the end we weren't able
,,,,,"to find it and they let me go without paying the fee, but it was humiliating to be made to feel like I was potentially trying to leave without paying when that wasn't the case"
,,,,,"Pretty good, I'd say it lives up to all the hype around this place. Sandwiches are stacked tall so if you are wondering why they are expensive they almost give you a whole pound of meat! I easily turned this into two meals."
,,,,,"We got the brisket and pastrami sandwiches and a matzo ball soup. The brisket sandwich was pretty moist and delicious but the pastrami sandwich I think was the favorite. It was extremely flavorful and was miles better than any other pastrami I have had. I also thought it was kind of cool that they just give you a TON of pickles with the sandwiches. The matzo ball soup was just alright with me, good chicken broth and the matzo ball tasted fine."
,,,,,"During this time they are pretty busy so they forgot some of my toppings on the sandwich, but other than that my experience with the takeout was generally positive and I would definitely order from here again."
,,,,,I love this place; even though the service was not great and the prices are through the roof!
,,,,,A NYC Staple!
,,,,,I am attempting a delivery order...
,,,,,I am hoping that it will be just as good.
,,,,,I'll rewrite if delivery is not idea
,,,,,Well it is not a great idea to order delivery from Katz's. Plus paid a fortune!
,,,,,No condiments were given with the order even though I wrote it in the notes. Pastrami sandwich with no mustard. No gravy for the brisket or any sauce...Ordered and payed for pickles and coleslaw and never got it.
,,,,,I won't do that again.  Live and learn!
,,,,,The Best! I am attempting a deliver order...
,,,,,I am hoping that it will be just as good.
,,,,,I'll rewrite if delivery is not ideal.
,,,,,True old school NY Icon.
,,,,,Great Pastrami Sandwiches!
,,,,,Pickles and tomatoes on the table.
,,,,,Everything is good. Just hard to get in now as it is so popular!
,,,,,I have only had the Reuben one of the best only stipulation I had was the price for the size of sandwich I got. Must try!
,,,,,"Personally, I feel like Katz's is a bit overrated. The meats are good (or at least the pastrami because that's what I got), but the sandwich itself is just a a bunch of meat slapped between two pieces of white bread. After a couple bites of only meat and bread, it gets tiring and I wished there were more flavors. I split the sandwich so I only ate half, but the taste of predominately meat made it very filling. I recommend adding mustard for more flavor!"
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,Now they're known for the best pastrami sandwiches in the world to me best sandwich I've had in years I appreciate the service I appreciate the amenities the conversation with the person making you a sandwich all around cool spot to eat at expensive pricey but worth it
,,,,,A New York institution and for good reason. Tasting their brisket is like seeing God.
,,,,,"Okay where do I even start. I know that you really didn't visit New York if you didn't stop here. I am not sure if it was extra busy because I went during Christmas, but man that place was PACKED! The line to get in was like a mile long. "
,,,,,"They hand you a ticket before you even step inside. DO NOT LOSE THAT TICKET! You will need it to exit the building, otherwise you have to pay the minimum fee."
,,,,,"Once you get in, good luck finding a line. There is a few of them, but it's honestly one massive crazy mess of people. You can choose to take the food to go, take the food to a seat yourself area, or sit down, dine in and have a server. The first time I got the food to go. I waited about 45 min outside, and another 30 min inside. They carve the meat right in front of you and give you a sample as you wait. So dang good. I got the pastrami sandwich. It is REALLY expensive. But it is worth it, really huge portions and the best pastrami you will ever have. Their pickles are also super amazing. It cuts the richness of the sandwich just right."
,,,,,"I chose to dine in the second time, still took just as long but it was nice to be able to sit down and enjoy the food. It's a very busy, packed, and fast paced environment but the food is amazing and I would wait in line any day for this place!"
,,,,,It's pretty tasty place - lately prices went up    Seams like pandemic did it's tall on this place
,,,,,"Be prepared for a line but it moves fast. Great packed sandwiches. The cutters are very nice and willing to answer any questions that you may have. It was my first time visiting, will definitely go back to this institution."
,,,,,"This is an iconic deli that everyone should try at least once! Claim to fame is they filmed the famous ""I'll have what she's having"" scene from When Harry met Sally here . Fun, fast paced atmosphere. All cute, friendly, fast talking guys behind the counter. a real ""New York"" experience! $20 for a sandwich is a bit ridiculous, but definitely good food. Always crowded."
,,,,,"Ok, so this is the FAMOUS deli where they filmed ""When Harry met Sally"". In business over 100 years from generation to generation. It was PACKED!! I wonder how many of the people there were local and how many were tourists? Everyone I spoke to was visiting and said they HAD to come here to see what all the hype was about!! VERY casual decor... sawdust on the floor? Old tables, wall to wall lines of people! There is absolutely no order here... it's just chaos!! You get in a line (which is not defined very well) with the pink ticket they hand you at the door (don't lose your ticket or you pay $50!!) then you order what sandwich, soup, drink you want. Then you pray you can find a table!! If you are handicapped or elderly and need to be served, you can sit at the far end of the restaurant and they will send a waiter out to you. The sandwich was huge (pastrami) and the soup was decent. I guess I'm not a big ""deli"" fan, so I wasn't overly impressed by the food... but it was such an interesting experience, I'm glad I came!!"
,,,,,One of the few staples of New York City that have lasted the test of time.
,,,,,"Twelve years ago when I first moved to New York, I was pretty much a tourist wanting to try all the famous places; naturally, Katz was on my list.  It didn't disappoint then, and it still does not disappoint now.  "
,,,,,"When I went this most recent time, I was there practically when it opened at 8am (just finished a shift and went with a coworker).  There was no line, we came in right away on a Sunday.  I don't know what the pandemic crowd would be like midday."
,,,,,"As you place your order, you stand and watch the person behind the counter cut up your pastrami (or choice of meat), and they give you a sample as you're waiting - I always loved that part and always look forward to it every time."
,,,,,"Ordered the pastrami Reuben.  After taxes was like +$25.  Don't have the exact prices available to me, but I think I remember sandwiches being ~$18 when I first went here; kind of a steep hike, but you are paying for quality.  Part of me thinks they're kind of trying to get away with it knowing their main competitor (in many peoples view) Carnegie Deli famously closed down, but with the current economic situation everywhere, I can't blame them for charging more if people like me are willing to pay."
,,,,,"Their pastrami is cooked to perfection.  Just the right amount of salt, the marbled fattiness lets it melt in your mouth (although I'll warn you the melting in your mouth doesn't always happen for whatever reason, but when it does it's magical).  They use good quality cheese.  The type of bread works well with the meat and cheese.  You really can't get this type of pastrami experience anywhere else in the world outside NYC (please compare this to Langers Deli in Los Angeles and you'll understand), so if you can afford the price, you gotta try it."
,,,,,"I also love it when you can meet the owners of a famous establishment and chit chat.  The owner of Katz will wander around, ask people how their meal is going, ask you where you're from.  It's a very New York thing (to name a few other places this happened to me were Jean Georges, Dominique Ansel, Carnegie Demi), adds such a nice touch."
,,,,,One of the go-tos and must try on every NYC list for +100 years.  Never gets old.
,,,,,FYI here is my yelp rating system
,,,,,"5=worth a trip, something you'll crave"
,,,,,4=worth getting but only if you're already in the area
,,,,,"3=only worth it if it's free/discounted, not worth paying full price"
,,,,,"2=would not even eat it if free, waste of stomach space"
,,,,,1=the place should shut down
,,,,,We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your visit - our long-time fans make our jobs so rewarding and fun. Hope to see you back again soon for another pastrami fix!
,,,,,Delicious gigantic deli sandwiches. Order one but split it between two people. The pastrami is great. The turkey is good too.  They do a great knish or even the wedge style fries. And leave room for antacid after dinner!
,,,,,We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your meal - drop by again soon and give our Reuben a try!
,,,,,This place has pastrami unlike any other pastrami I have ever tasted! The meat was juicy and delicious and the sandwich came with plenty of pickles. However the quantity was pretty small for a $27 sandwich. I would try it if you are ever in New York but I'm not sure the price is worth it.
,,,,,"Where do I even start... I guess with their pastrami sandwiches. They truly define what a pastrami sandwich should be. Don't cheat yourself by getting lean cuts. It should always have a little fat on it at least. Also, the hot dogs are the best in the city. They coined the term, ""franks and beans"" over a hundred years ago. Worth stopping by anytime you're in the lower east side. 10/10"
,,,,,205 E Houston St
,,,,,"New York, NY 10002"
,,,,,"Every New Yorker should experience Katz's once in their life! Even if the lines are long, the experience of watching your meal get assembled and interaction with the cutter is awesome. Pastrami is so juicy, tender, and salty. Unlike anything you've had before!"
,,,,,A legendary NYC spot that lives up to its legacy. Prepare yourself before arriving - this place is big and almost always busy! You get a ticket when you arrive and your order will be written on there - then you hand it in at the exit & pay when you leave. 
,,,,,"There are multiple stations where you can just walk up and order - my personal recommendations are the matzoh ball soup and brisket sandwich! All of the sandwiches are delicious though and come stacked high with meat so, come hungry."
,,,,,"I also love how late they are usually open in non-covid times - if you go out on the Lower East Side, it's perfect for grabbing a late-night bite after the bars. Grilled cheese is my go-to option in that scenario! Be back soon!"
,,,,,"This place was well worth the $30 I spent for what is by far the best pastrami sandwich I've ever had. It was worth two meals. The mustard was sharp and contrasting to the meat. The pastrami itself was flavorful, tender, really everything you would want and hope. I would get there earlier in the morning if you can, before the lunch rush as you can find yourself waiting for over an hour otherwise. Definitely would recommend and I'll be getting their sandwiches whenever I visit NYC."
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed your meal. And yes, though we do often serve a full house, the best times to try and avoid the crowd are breakfast, between lunch/dinner and after the dinner rush! Hope to see you back again next time you're in town."
,,,,,The workers are really nice and they give you 3 slices of pastrami to snack on while you wait.
,,,,,Best pastrami sandwich I've had in my life. The entire meal was a foodie experience. They cut the meat and prepare the sandwich in front of you and ask you to sample the cut before preparing. Large hefty  serving of delicious steak fries. If you are visiting NYC this place won't let you down.
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your first visit - there's nothing we love more than making new fans. And if you're ever craving a cross-country pastrami fix, we offer free two-day shipping on all orders over $100! Hope to see you back again soon."
,,,,,"The price may seem steep for the pastrami sandwich, but believe me when I say it's a HUGE amount of meat. It was piled so high it looked like double what I expected. I would recommend splitting this between two people. Even better, maybe toast your own bread to form a second sandwich with the excess meat. Their bread is really good, though. Even though the quantity is huge, I wouldn't say the taste was mind-blowing. It's a solid sandwich, but not a must-have unless you are a huge deli meats fan."
,,,,,The Pastrami here is the best in the world in my opinion.
,,,,,There's no question about it this is the place where all other pastrami sandwiches are judged.
,,,,,This place is a staple in NYC. I got the classic Reuben sandwich which was tasty but also on the expensive side for what it is. They do give you a generous potion of meat and I did enjoy the sandwich.
,,,,,5/28 today. Memorial Day Weekend. 
,,,,,"PACKED SOLID INSIDE AND OUT WITH A LONG LINE OUTSIDE. It moved fairly quickly. They're still adhering to COVID safety standards. Most people including customers had on a mask. There's one dedicated line for a server, they call you when they're ready. I got a turkey sandwich this visit, and my order was accurate. Pickles were sour. The server who packed my order did a phenomenal job. He double wrapped everything nicely. My sandwich was stacked, and he gave me a side of mustard. I went to go get change and came back to tip, and he was gone."
,,,,,Just stopped in tonight. Hand sanitizer and temperature checks at the ticket desk entry just through the door. Got a pastrami and Swiss to go. I need turkey next. Their turkey should be as widely celebrated as their pastrami is
,,,,,"Stopped in for a pastrami and Rye with Swiss, and fries Friday night. Was crowded, but wasn't standing room only. Food was good as usual. My server gave me the fatty parts of the pastrami but it's a lesson learned for next time"
,,,,,"this place is still amazing. i had to have my turkey fix. i had gotten the coveted pastrami previously. never shockingly had their cheesesteak, which i hear great reviews about. this place is so nostalgic. how can one possibly visit katzs and not take away some warm sentimental memories here, and a great meal?"
,,,,,"Still great. Went on a Saturday, and it was pandemonium. PACKED SOLID. Had a Pastrami Reuben on Rye, which I added to the gallery. Got it to go."
,,,,,"Katz is nothing short of perfection. The pastrami, corned beef, turkey, all are winners. The steak fries are a hit as well. Next time I go, I'm getting a Philly Cheesesteak  (which I never had) and a Pastrami Reuben with fries. It's best to go on a weekday afternoon. Don't go on the weekend, because it's crowded and you will wait forever in the line. Don't lose your ticket at the front door! They will charge you!"
,,,,,Had to wait outside in line for about 30min but well worth the wait. Food is great!!!!!! First time I have ever been here and I  had never had pickled tomatoes but they awesome!!! Two thumbs up from me!!!
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your first visit - there's nothing we love more than making new fans! And if you want to dodge the crowds next time, try dropping by at an off-peak hour: breakfast, between lunch/dinner or after the dinner rush. Hope to see you back again soon!"

,,,,,"Honestly paying 64 dollars plus on two sandwiches is a bit much. The taste of the sandwich is in all fairness ,pretty good, but I cannot see what is so special that it should cost such an exorbitant amount. I have had better sandwiches that only costs 13 dollars out in canarsie same in size and probably more pastrami ."
,,,,,Absolutely amazing pastrami sandwich. The best pastrami ever. The bread was a little dry and tough but the pastrami was so good nothing else mattered. The pickles I had smelled a little weird but it's okay because the pastrami was just so worth haha.
,,,,,"This restaurant is basically NYC in a nutshell. Since this is a very popular location among tourists and locals expect a long line outside. It is worth the wait though as the food there is delicious. The pastrami sandwiches are giant, filling, and very greasy. You get to watch the butchers as they chop up your pickles and meat for you, and they even give you a few free samples as you wait! I will definitely go back when I visit NYC again! Extra points for being featured in Harry Met Sally"
,,,,,NOT FANCY JUST THE BEST.
,,,,,"But the lines are so long, its best to go for lunch not dinner."
,,,,,Good sandwich but very pricey.  You can share with a friend though.
,,,,,A lil tip can get you a few extra pickles too.
,,,,,"This deli has rightfully earned its title as the best pastrami sandwich in NY. We ordered the Reuben with Pastrami and they sliced the pastrami right in front of us, and even gave us the leftovers on a plate as to not waste even a single bit of meat. Then they got the steaming hot saurkraut and melted cheese to put on top top of the giant 2 inch stack of pastrami."
,,,,,"Each bite into the sandwich just melts in your mouth. The saltiness and meatiness is just perfect and the little bit of sour from the saurkraut balances the flavors. The thick cuts of pastrami just fall apart in your mouth, as if you don't even need teeth to chew."
,,,,,"The only downside is the price, with our order coming in at 25 dollars (not including tax). Also the steak cut fries are not worth 7 dollars at all, I would avoid ordering those."
,,,,,This place is a timeless classic! Hadn't eaten here since Covid but finally went back and it was even better than ever! 
,,,,,Best pastrami on rye in the world! Massive portion. Really a sandwich for two people. So delicious and worth every dollar spent!
,,,,,"After waiting 30mins in line and hearing about how great the food is and of course the movie ""When Harry Met Sally"". This place is just awful. Hot food was cold. When asked for it hot I was told to deal with it. Asked to speak to a Manager and no one ever came. Just kept getting the run around. I can't stress how bad of a let down this place was. Do yourself a favor and go ANYWHERE but here."
,,,,,My very first visit to Katz's was last week and oh my gosh what I have been missing! Our pastrami was the most tender we have ever had. The two of us split a sandwich and we were stuffed.
,,,,,"So impressed with the efficiency on processing the crowd, that we ordered deli trays for our friends this week. "
,,,,,It was so easy to deal with their catering department and online ordering.
,,,,,We would go back to New York just to eat at Katz's! I'm not kidding. I wish they would open a branch in Traverse City Michigan where we have nothing like it. Put it on your bucket list!
,,,,,The line was not long when we went there. We got the pastrami sandwich and corned beef  with a side of pickles and cucumbers. The sandwich was flavorful. This place is a great deli. Highly recommended for anyone in NYC interested in trying new food.

,,,,,Due to The city shut down we got food to go. Luckily we picked up that morning when it wasn't busy at all. They checked our temperatures when we walked in the door and everybody social distance. When it was our turn we walked up we still got to taste the fresh corn beef. It was so flavorful and amazing. I just decided to get a corn beef Ruben except the sauerkraut and I substituted it for coleslaw. The sandwich was amazing and very overwhelming. I could only finish half of the sandwich . It was honestly enough for my cousin and I to share 1 sandwich. 
,,,,,I can see why this place is famous! Def will be going back.
,,,,,"What is there not to love about Katz's? Yes it is expensive, but where else can you get pastrami stacked like that. I always have to pair any sammie with the matzo ball soup. It's one huge ball of fluffiness plopped in broth. "
,,,,,"I was missing Katz's while in stay-at-home, so I ordered a box in the mail when I had family in town. Do it! It had the works. Pickles, their mustard & the same exact bread. Everything was fresh & delicious. You just heat up the sandwich meat by boiling it, and it's nearly as good as the real thing."
,,,,,"Why does everybody keep raving about Katz's delicatessen? The meat was tasty but when you slice it with a knife by hand they don't use a slicing machine. This process makes it too thick and grizzly. Corn beef and pastrami are typically cheap fatty and tough. Although they're tasty, it has to be sliced very thin to not be a challenge to eat."
,,,,,"If the long line doesn't tell you that this spot is the SH!T, then take my word for it.  I now understand why this deli is ranked as a MUST have for NYC it's ICONIC.  These guys have service and efficiency down to a science, the line moved like a well-oiled machine.  You're given a ticket, yummy samples and then place your order.  The sandwiches are massively stuffed, the meat is FRESH and sooooo tender.  I got the pastrami and corn beef Reuben mix, a side of food coma came with it, whewwww!! So glad we got to experience this spot, it's a true NYC staple."

,,,,,A must if in Manhattan!  Amazing corned beef and pastrami. The sandwiches are easily a meal for 2. Don't lose your ticket!
,,,,,"Man, the last time I was here was when I lived in the area about 13 years ago. There's something to be said about quality v quantity. "
,,,,,"Everything was delicious but at the same time just tooo much. I feel like if there was more kraut, and less pastrami the sandwich would have been more balanced like I remember from the old days."
,,,,,Don't ask for Mayo!
,,,,,"After all these years, my familiar sandwich maker guy is long gone, but the pastrami is still the best. There is other stuff on the menu like the knishes and hot dogs but When I'm here, I'm here for the pastrami."
,,,,,"There was a time when I could polish off a pastrami sandwich comfortably but those days are long gone.  My best way to eat a Katz pastrami sandwich these days is to get a piece whole to take home to slice up and make sandwiches on my own.  It doesn't take away any from the taste of the pastrami when you take it home and you can be as messy as you want when nobody is looking.  If you do get your sandwiches made by these experts, the pastrami slices are thick cut and juicy which makes a difference in my opinion. "
,,,,,"A few tips to know before your first visit, they have these archaic rules regarding the ordering ticket that you are given when you walk in.  You'll need that to order food with that ticket so don't lose it.  You'll have to hand that ticket back if you don't use it so don't take it if you don't need it.  They also have separate lines for each server/section which makes it a hassle if you need to wait on separate lines for hot dogs or knishes or fries.  Those tip jars in front aren't for show, make sure you tip when your server is looking for the best quality/service.  You will also be judged if you ask for Mayo so just don't!"
,,,,,Finally it is no doubt a pricey sandwich and it's also a bit out of the way to get to.  But do make the trip because there aren't too many institutions like Katz's around anymore and this one is definitely worthy it.
,,,,,"It's a staple here in NYC, the amount of food I get is insane. One of the best food I've had in my life, everyone must try it once in their life."
