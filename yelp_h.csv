,,,,,"Houston, TX 77006"
,,,,,Chicken Fattoush Salad and Waffle Fry Fondue. Enough said. Game over. 
,,,,,Just go and thank me later.
,,,,,"Super small yet cute place! The wait was about 10 mins for indoor dining not too bad. The staff and server were very friendly and welcoming. The food omg the food was delicious! I like the eggs and French toast the best. The eggs were scrambled perfectly and the French toast they used some kind of cinnamon swirl bread it was sweet and tasty. It was an overall good breakfast, will return."
,,,,,Stopped by on a Sunday morning and it was pretty full but there is seating space outside and inside. 
,,,,,The Green Eggs and Ham and the fresh orange juice were the highlight of my day. 
,,,,,If you must try anything in the menu that's it.
,,,,,If you're on a bigger group don't expect to find a spot inside were you're comfortable. It gets pretty tight and uncomfortable in there when full but honestly those green eggs will have me back.
,,,,,"I took my grandparents to Baby Barnaby's over the weekend, and even though we got there 15 minutes after they opened, we took the last available table inside! I'be been here a few times prior and it's always crowded, but it's worth the wait for some deliciously simple breakfast food. "
,,,,,"Located in bright and shining Montrose, this adorable little breakfast spot is full of smiling faces, from customers to delightful staff. The cute one-page menus are full of great breakfast options that make it clear you really can't go wrong. They've got veggie options, a few vegan ones, and plenty for the meat eaters. "
,,,,,"I got the Migas this time, and they were really delicious. They load up eggs with fresh peppers and onions, but it's not at all spicy. The salsa has great flavor but little to no kick, so it leaves some to be desired in the heat department. On the table were also a standard breakfast plate and a plate of steak and eggs. Their scrambled eggs are fluffy and fresh tasting, over medium looked perfect, as well. Nana reported the wheat toast was great and not too dark of a wheat, while the English muffins was not ideal. The steak was a little tough, but had really great flavor. The bacon was a good middle of the road thickness, and not too salty, and was received well. Their coffee was awesome, but nothing beats fresh-pressed orange juice. "
,,,,,"I always enjoy breakfasts here, and I think you will too, just try to come in early!"
,,,,,I enjoyed a standard eggs and bacon breakfast plate. We also had the green eggs and those were amazing. Food and coffee were excellent. I would love to visit again.
,,,,,"Baby Barnaby's is a great brunch spot that meets trendiness with homey vibe. The seating area is quite small so the wait times can feel like forever, but the food makes it all worth it. I've brought several friends here in the hopes of spreading the word about this humble restaurant because it is just that good! One last thing: order the orange juice."
,,,,,"After a year of settling into the city, I finally made it to this neighborhood brunch favorite on a weekday around 10:30. Friend and I walked right in with no wait and were greeted with the most genuine hello. People there just seemed so happy!"
,,,,,"We both got the green eggs. OJ for me and coffee for friend, both were solid 5 stars. The eggs and sausage were delicious; potatoes and toast were standard. Note for future self: get different plates and share, the portion size is Texas standard.. "
,,,,,"Not sure if it's worth the wait on the weekends, but I'll def be back for another weekday brunch and try out the rest of their menu!"
,,,,,"One of my favorite breakfast places in houston. The migas with chorizo is flavorful, slightly spicy, and delicious! My boyfriend got the chicken fried steak, which was also amazing."
,,,,,My two favorite things about this place: the OJ and the potatoes!!! 
,,,,,"The only reason I give them 4, instead of 5 stars is the service is mediocre (not the server's fault) because they seem understaffed (serve a massive crowd with very few servers). Also the waffle was very cakey and dense, but saying that because I'm a tough critic of waffles (one of my fave breakfast foods!)"
,,,,,"Side note: on the weekends, this place ALWAYS has a wait but it's worth it! Get there early if you're impatient!"
,,,,,"I can't say enough good stuff about this cutie patootie diner! There really aren't any vegan options but if you're vegetarian they have veggie sausage patties and some other options. Our server  Scott, was by far my favorite server, ever. He was funny, had great suggestions and was nice. It's super cute in there and my omnivorous friends really enjoyed their meals. I liked mine, too. Thanks so much for the laughs, Scott! You're the best."
,,,,,"The wait is quite long but it's worth it for the large servings, good food and friendly service. "
,,,,,I had the blueberry pancake and it was HUGE! It covered the entire plate. 
,,,,,My friend had the smoked salmon and she said it was delicious! 
,,,,,The veggie sausage are UH-mazing!

,,,,,"Houston, TX 77098"
,,,,,Everything was tasty!
,,,,,My friend and I met up for happy hour on a weekday evening and enjoyed it!
,,,,,"We ordered an assortment off of the HH menu (Kobe beef tacos, longhorn roll, spicy salmon roll, ceviche, vegan gyoza). The tacos were tasty! Sushi and ceviche was quality-made! Only minor complaint was that the vegan gyoza tasted a bit too ""healthy"" haha. Still tasty nonetheless."
,,,,,My friend ordered the spicy soy ramen off of the regular dinner menu. It came in a huge portion (although priced at $15) and was flavorful.
,,,,,"For dessert we ordered the blueberry cake with earl grey ice cream - such a delightful, not overly sweet pairing that was just right!"
,,,,,"Otherwise we were seated right away upon arrival, the booth fit my friend's baby carrier just right, and our waitress was very attentive. Our water glasses were never left empty. "
,,,,,"A bit pricey, but you get quality food. Their HH menu is the perfect way to try out a great sushi place without breaking the bank."
,,,,,Love this place. Second experience is just as great as my first. The food was on point. Happened to be on vacation and was craving for the bone marrow so we stopped by for lunch and I'm still very impressed. Our service was very informative and attentive. I believe his name was Ngo. My boyfriend and I are very satisfied with today's performance. Thanks guys! Definitely recommend
,,,,,"Really enjoyed my meal at Kata Robata. We ordered the chicken skewers, spicy soy ramen and A special spicy sushi roll (forgot the name). Service was prompt and kind. I am usually not a ramen fan however I would come back to Kata Robata for ramen. It was the perfect balance between a heavy and light broth. I believe this was due to the fresh toppings they included to help balance the fatty/heavy side to this dish. The sushi was very fresh and the cut of fish was perfectly balanced to give the right texture. The chicken skewers were juicy very flavorful!"
,,,,,"I've been looking for a quality sushi place in Houston for awhile, and Kata Robata really exceeded my expectations. I had a business lunch here with two colleagues. We made a reservation, and I'm glad we did. We arrived at 12:30, and for the next hour, every table was completely full."
,,,,,"For lunch, they have a special lunch menu. But we ordered a few items for appetizers off the main menu. Highly recommend the Kobe Beef Skewers!! It was perfect to share - two skewers with two pieces of beef on both. It was so tender and delicious."
,,,,,"They have sushi and roll combo options on the lunch menu. I got the 3 sushi & roll, which came with two different rolls (8 pieces total) and then three sushi pieces. Lunch specials also came with soup or salad. One of my colleagues got the miso soup and said it was the best miso soup he's ever had!"
,,,,,We finished off with creme brûlée for dessert. It's topped with nutella cream that's made in house and tasted amazing!!! 
,,,,,"Overall, great quality and great atmosphere. Can't wait to come back here again!"
,,,,,"Came here for a nice, casual lunch for my friend's 21st birthday and loved the vibes. The food was also beyond our expectations! "
,,,,,"We ordered the wagyu skewers to start and they were so tender, they melt in your mouth. "
,,,,,Then we ordered the Chirashi bowl to share and it was more than enough for the two of us. We also got a side of sushi rice for the sashimi. 
,,,,,"Lastly, we had the green tea soufflé with red bean ice cream for dessert. It was recommended that we eat each piece of soufflé with the ice cream and it was a truly spectacular combination!"
,,,,,Yuzu salmon carpaccio 4/5: very good. I love acid on raw seafood. Beautiful presentation
,,,,,Fresh catch ceviche 4/5: also very good. I loved the cucumber and fish. I really liked it. Wish there was more. 
,,,,,Cauliflower 2/5: it feels weird to eat something creamy and hot with raw and acidic items. I wish we didn't order this. 
,,,,,Brussel sprouts 3/5: they were good but I prefer Uchi's. 
,,,,,"Longhorn roll 5/5: fried shrimp, eel, Avocado, tobiko, and unagi sauce. "
,,,,,Spider roll 3/5: it was not good. The flavor was bland. 
,,,,,Bartenders choice this Friday was Sapporo black 
,,,,,Kokonatsu Lychee: it was incredibly sweet; I felt the hair on my chest grow. I don't really drink. My husband said it was a fine drink. Not poured too heavily. 
,,,,,Texas Kobe beef skewers 5/5: a must eat. The meat falls off of the bone. It's well marinated (72 hours) and so delicious. 
,,,,,Japanese amberjack sashimi with foie gras 5/5: just so amazing. The fat from the foie gras and the raw amberjack and peanuts. Omg. 
,,,,,To sum it up: the happy hour food was unimpressive but the food items on the full menu was outstanding.
,,,,,Love this place! Amazing food as always. It gets busy though so make sure to make reservations early on. My son is a very picky eater but he absolutely loved the wagyu sando.
,,,,,"Seriously may be my go to sushi spot from now on! Came for lunch, and the plaza was already packed by 11AM! We had to circle and circle over and over just to get a spot. The wait time must tell you something, for the restaurant just opening and having to wait 20~ minutes just for a party of 2, must mean it's popular and worth coming to!"
,,,,,We ordered:
,,,,,"Roll Combo B which consists of California Roll (4pcs), Crunchy Eel Roll (8pcs), Rock 'n Roll (5pcs), Bento Shrimp Tempura, Texas Kobe Beef Yakiniku Don, and Katsu Don, and one order of salmon sushi."
,,,,,Everything was SOOOO GOOD. The salmon sushi was so buttery. 
,,,,,I love that the lunch menu/ menu is very simple. That means the chef can finesse everything on the menu. I cannot wait to go back to try their dinner menu or even happy hour.
,,,,,"A very late review. Dined in october 2019. A little disappointed on the service up front. Called for an omakase reservation and when we arrived, they said they didn't have us down for omakase. And then told us that the omakase chef isn't here on Wednesdays and Sundays, which I wish was mentioned over the phone! My boyfriend and I wanted omakase to celebrate our anniversary, but we were really disappointed. "
,,,,,"I read Yelp reviews before I go out to eat and I did read other reviews about people not getting their omakase reservations in. I thought that it must've been a one time mix up, but I guess they do that often here. Probably too loud in the restaurant to hear phone calls properly."
,,,,,"The restaurant didn't look that full, but it was pretty loud. It was difficult talking to my boyfriend because we don't usually talk loudly. The lighting is really dim and we sat near the back, close to the door to their tables outside. Every time that door opened, there was a cold breeze and there was a big party eating back there. I was pretty cold all night due to that."
,,,,,"Now I'm done with my little rant, so onto reviews about the food."
,,,,,"We started with some pork gyoza to give us some time to look over the menu since we didn't anticipate not getting our omakase. We got salmon, chutoro, otoro, tamago, uni, spicy chopped scallop, yellowtail, and kohada sushi."
,,,,,"Heritage Pork Miso Gyoza: 2/5, if it was supposed to be crispy, it wasn't. Taste was meh, can find much better at half the price, $9 for 4 dumplings"
,,,,,"Salmon Sushi: 5/5, really delicious and high quality"
,,,,,"Chutoro: 5/5, perfect balance of fat and fish imo"
,,,,,"Otoro: 4/5, couldn't tell if it was less fresh than the chutoro, but I thought I would like this more than chutoro"
,,,,,"Uni: 3/5, I wasn't much of a fan"
,,,,,"Spicy chopped scallop: 4/5, pretty good, somewhat roughly chopped so that you still can taste and feel the texture of the scallop"
,,,,,"Kohada: 1/5, did not taste fresh"
,,,,,Tried more things. 
,,,,,Shishito Mojito - viable for happy hour. Best drink I've tried here - very light and airy. Just a touch of spice but not too much. Refreshing. 
,,,,,Iberico Pork Shumai - wrapper is very sticky; will stick to the spoon. The chili oil on top isn't too overpowering. Very well seasoned. Don't know that they're really worth $3 a piece though? 
,,,,,"Amaebi - sweet shrimp market price. They forgot to bring me the fried head for a while but brought it out pretty quickly when prompted. Great fry on this, fresh, nothing to complain about. "
,,,,,Yakitori 
,,,,,"There are two kinds, 'regular' and teriyaki. The just seasoned regular kind is very bland and tough. Definitely pick the teriyaki if you're going to order this."
,,,,,I wish I could come to lunch here every day - it's really rather reasonably priced for such an upscale place. 
,,,,,Roll Combo B $14 w/ a King Crab California $5 add-on. 
,,,,,King Crab California Roll - the meat is sooo fresh - the best roll on this combo and it's an add-on. There's a place called Shiro's in Seattle that does a muchhh better crab roll but it's not a california and that's neither here nor there since it's so far awa. 
,,,,,Crunchy Eel Roll - this is the most 'expensive' or most 'dressed' roll on this combo. Lots of caviar on top both black and orange so it's got a nice crunch to it on top of the actual crunchy eel part. Most similar to quality of some of their regular menu rolls. 
,,,,,Rock 'n Roll - this is were Kata Robata sort of drops the ball. It's nice but nothing fancy or palatable. The rice seems like too much in quantity and I couldn't really taste any of the ingredients that well. If you go a few miles south there's a place called Asahi that does a lovely Rock 'n Roll with great seasoning and sauce for cheaper. 
,,,,,1706 Westheimer Rd
,,,,,Tempura Udon 
,,,,,Wow. For only $9 you get this amazing udon. The noodles are cooked perfectly. It tastes very clean - definitely not over-seasoned or over-salted. The spinach also tastes very clean - probably just thrown in there raw. The mushrooms and green onion are what give most of the flavor. We had the tempura on the side so that might have affected the taste a little but hopefully not that much. Would like it if it had a bit more salt to it. Tempura are fall apart in mouth fresh of course. 
,,,,,Service was relatively quick and friendly - Kristy/Christie/Kristie? did a great job.
,,,,,~.~.~
,,,,,Also came here for Memorial Day 
,,,,,They did not have lunch special that day so keep in mind on holidays they might be open but they only serve dinner menu. 
,,,,,The special day that was a crab karaage - I did not have this but we sat right next to the bowl containing the live crabs they were frying up. Apparently at one point one escaped and made it out onto the patio and they let them go instead of capturing them again since they'd worked so hard. 
,,,,,Miso Lobster Mac and Cheese
,,,,,Apparently they make this with cheese from dairy maids - a local cheese shop. Personally I felt like the crust of cheese on top was too much. It was too salty and just too much. I felt sick after having eaten less than half the dish - I suppose there can be too much of a good thing. There was a lot of lobster in it though and it tasted very fresh. 
,,,,,Unagi Sashimi - these usually come with 2 for one order but they only gave me one. I didn't ask about it but I wonder if it was a mistake or something they do different for unagi? 
,,,,,"Sake Sashimi - of course just excellent quality. No fishy smell at all, very buttery. "
,,,,,"Houston, TX 77098"
,,,,,"My girlfriends kidnapped me for my birthday and took me here! I was intimidated by the line at forst because it literally WRAPPED around the front of the store. But it moved quickly. I was so overwhelmed with the noise and surprise of it all,but it was so good. I ended up with the proscuitto and artichoke flatbread,and a pistachio croissant and a hibicus mimosa. "
,,,,,Everything was beautiful and deliscious.
,,,,,This was the first location I have ever been to . I love everything about it . Hoping and praying the prices will come down a bit ! Lol  
,,,,,The line can be really long on the weekends in the morning . Some items get sold pretty fast ! Parking space is a bit limited.
,,,,,Great food but unfortunately the most horrible guest service person. Most of the people who work here are nice and friendly but the guest service manager is aggressive and rude. Be aware!
,,,,,"Stopped in for a sweet treat and was overwhelmed with choices! Ended up choosing the raspberry lychee tart, fig & goat cheese macaron, as well as a muffin. Had a chai latte to drink."
,,,,,"The macaron was definitely my favorite! I ordered the tart more for its aesthetic than anything, I wasn't a fan of the texture."
,,,,,"My only real complaint was it was very crowded, and there were no labels indicating what all the different treats were. It made deciding a bit rushed and stressful. "
,,,,,"I'll come back to try more, I'm really curious about all they have to offer!"
,,,,,What we ordered: 
,,,,,"They fly in 80% of their fish from Japan three times a week, never frozen."
,,,,,Miso Gyoza 
,,,,,"Small, but lovely. Seems to be steamed instead of the typical fried gyoza. They came out piping hot with a variety of vegetables dotting the plate including shishito pepper, and carrots which were delicious in their own right. "
,,,,,Ocean Picante 
,,,,,"Who would have thought this combination could be so delectable? As soon as it hits your mouth you taste the wonderful spice of the peppercorn salmon, the jalapenos, the garlic chili oil all placed on top. Then, as you bite, you encounter the lovely crunch of the fried asparagus and the sweet beauty of the spicy tuna. It's executed absolutely perfectly. The rice is properly portioned, the serving is ample. Well worth the price. "
,,,,,Tamago 
,,,,,"You guys. I think I've just had the best egg of my life. Marinated with sugar and soy sauce, this egg sashimi absolutely MELTS in your mouth. I just couldn't have enough of it. "
,,,,,Peppercorn Salmon
,,,,,"This comes as a sashimi or sushi order - something I've never seen before in a sushi restaurant and something I never knew I needed until now. Although the regular sake sashimi is much thicker, I think the compromise of having that fresh peppercorn is very worth it. "
,,,,,"The restaurant is packed even late on a thursday. Be prepared to sit through the loud roar of guests experiencing pure ecstacy. Admist all this, the servers do exceptionally well. Kata Robata is like a well oiled machine, delivering happiness in the form of food to its customers."
,,,,,Lavender Latte - wonderful! 
,,,,,The croissants were huge and amazingly delicious. 
,,,,,I love the little details - they take pride in their product & store. I highly recommend stopping by and checking out Common Bond Cafe & Bakery.
,,,,,"My favoriteee place to get pastries in Houston. As soon as you walk into the shop, you'll find a glass full of pastries, bread and cake. If you ever have trouble deciding what to get... I HIGHLY recommend the kouign-amann. Out of all their croissants, the almond croissant is my go-to choice. It's fluffy on the inside while the outside has a crispy/flakey shell that's dusted with powdered sugar. "
,,,,,"Unfortunately, it does get pretty busy and the parking lot fills up very fast. But the pastries are worth it!"
,,,,,The best part about this place is the coffee. I've tried to give this place a shot but the taste does not come CLOSE to the price of these pastries.
,,,,,"What a lovely bakery! Love the breads, pastries and croissants (pistachio and chocolate - yum!). Would love to order one of their beautiful cakes for a special occasion. "
,,,,,"Atmosphere-wise was modern and a little loud, but really your traditional upscale bakery environment. They have spacious tables and the usual coffee/tea/beverage service. We didn't try the savory foods, but they looked great. I should plan to look at that menu more closely next time. Would definitely come back for some pastries and breads to go, also!  "
,,,,,Service was nice and attentive. They answered all of our questions and made recommendations.
,,,,,"Overall, maybe a touch pricy, but worth it for the excellent quality."
,,,,,Great experience. My friend forgot to order a coffee and the manager (I believe) brought her one free of charge. Then brought us free desserts while they were closing. Top notch customer service and will be back!
,,,,,"Awesome service! Lady at the bakery part of was super helpful. We got the tiramisu macarons, lavender latte, chai latte and chocolate walnut cookie. My friend thought the chocolate walnut cookie was okay but liked the chai latte. The lavender latte was pretty good, not too sweet. The tiramisu macrons were a bit small for the price but good as well."
,,,,,Parking is pretty limited since the area is shared by several other businesses. But complimentary valet is offered.  
,,,,,Be sure to make a reservation if you don't want to wait.

,,,,,"Houston, TX 77006"
,,,,,"Cute brunch spot bursting with loads of energy and good vibes. Good food (not amazing) although it came out cold. On a Saturday morning my party of 2 arrived @ 11am  and was seated @ 1210. We were #26 in line to be seated with many parties of 2 before us. Personally, I thought our wait time was to be expected so no gripes there. I was able to add my party to the waitlist using the Yelp waitlist from the comfort of my car which kept me informed. I could see exactly where I was on the waitlist with live updates. 4 stars because the food was on the cold side, no special excellent flavors & my omelette was messed up. They did recook my omelette making it a top priority and getting it back to me hot and quick due to the mishap."
,,,,,Looove the brulee grapefruit. So interesting! The yogurt was delicious and the housemade granola was super flavorful. With maybe cinnamon?? Yummm. 
,,,,,The make your own omlette was perfectly cooked and a good amount of each ingredient requested. 
,,,,,The blueberry pancakes needed more blueberries but was super tasty and cooked nice and fluffy. 
,,,,,Travis was our server and SUPER nice even under duress. My large dog was being a butthead and he handled it so well. I hope he accepted our show of appreciation!! 
,,,,,Will keep returning.
,,,,,Always tasty at snooze!! My favorite is the Bella Belly and the Harvest Bunny Benedict's. Their pancakes are all good. Housemade jams are great. 
,,,,,The staff is always friendly. Way easier to get a table during the week as they are always busy. I love it here
,,,,,Please allow at least an hour wait if you plan to sit at a table to enjoy your breakfast items the pancakes were delicious hashbrowns with Barbacoa was really good I had the bacon bliss drink that was pretty good as well
,,,,,The wait time is interesting in so much as there is not a stand out dish or drink to Rationalize the long wait
,,,,,"Price - Benny Duo was 15.75, the drink was 8, so plus tip you leave breakfast/brunch with a full stomachs and about 25$ short. I'd say it's a fair price, definitely not cheap, but next time I can do without the drink. Eggs Benedict were well worth the price."
,,,,,"Experience - Eating here has inspired me to try making hollandaise sauce and Eggs Benedict at home to recreate the flavors. We came early, maybe 40 minutes after they have opened, but the place was already packed. From the very extensive menu, I narrowed down to my main goal which were the Eggs Benedict, but even with the 6 options, all seemed so promising that I had to go with the Benny Duo - the half and half option that let the indecisive eater chooses two Benny toppings. Mine was a combo of Smashed Avocado and Bella Bella (prosciutto and balsamic dressing). I ordered an AM Manhattan to really kick off the morning as well. Quick service even for a packed place."
,,,,,"Benny Duo - one word, heavenly! So very fulfilling with a good serving of perfectly cooked hash brown and healthy side of arugula. Smashed Avocado tasted fresh and nicely seasoned with smoked cheddar hollandaise. The balsamic glaze was a nice touch on the Bella Bella with cream cheese hollandaise. Eggs were perfectly poached."
,,,,,"AM Manhattan - had a nice boozy kick. Was not overpowering, still had the expresso taste. Could not say the same about my friend's Dirty Drunken Chai though, that was a mouth full of straight up rum! Maybe they forgot the ""sweet chai"" part in her order."
,,,,,VEGAN REVIEW:
,,,,,The wait for Snooze was about 30 minutes on a weekday afternoon.
,,,,,"The menu items are not indicated or labeled 'vegan', but there are a few dishes that are easily veganizable. As per my waitress, below are the dishes that can be made vegan. As always, be sure to check with your waiter/waitress when ordering!"
,,,,,- the Snooze Classic 
,,,,,- Scramble
,,,,,- Snooze Spuds Deluxe
,,,,,- Juan's Breakfast Tacos
,,,,,- Snooze Breakfast Burrito
,,,,,"I ordered the scramble, which is generally made with eggs, but for vegans, it's done with tofu. With the scramble, you get 3 add-ons. I got spinach, mushrooms, and soy chorizo. The dish also came with hash browns and a choice between flour or corn tortillas. I got the corn. This tofu scramble was one of the best tofu scrambles I've had. I liked that I was able to ""customize"" it by choosing what to add to it. The hash browns were browned to perfection and very comforting to eat. The only thing that I did not like about my dish was the tortillas! The corn tortillas were a bust: stale, dry, and just not good. I really hate wasting food and will never usually throw food away but I could not eat those tortillas, so I ended up leaving them on my plate. "
,,,,,"A tip my waitress left me that might be helpful to other vegans is that if the hash browns are rounded in appearance, like they have been cooked in a cookie cutter, that means they have butter in them. If the hash browns are flat (see pictures), that means there's NO butter in them and they are vegan-friendly. "
,,,,,A tip from me: try the Yellowbird Serrano hot sauce. It is SO good and might make you want to steal a bottle for yourself! Don't fret - you can buy the hot sauce at some local Sprouts and Whole Foods :)
,,,,,"Me and my friend came from out of town and decided to try this place out. Let me just say that the food was amazing. Everything tastes exquisite! What made the experience phenomenal was the customer service that we received from Tommy our waiter! He remained attentive throughout our visit. He made sure we had everything we needed. Never in my 23 years of living have I ever received such amazing customer service. Overall, I was really impressed with the experience I had at this restaurant! Keep up the good work (:"
,,,,,"Food was delicious, but the service was amazing.  Peter was kind, funny and chatted with me.  Will definitely be back!"
,,,,,"Wait is a pain in the *ss.  I was here over a year ago and waited 2 hours so it took me a while to come back.  This time it was a 45-1 hour, which was what they quoted me on the two hour wait but actually this time it was fulfilled.  Parking is pretty much street curb unless you get lucky to park on their half of the parking lot."
,,,,,Carful of the potential crazy bums walking along Montrose.
,,,,,My picks are the pancakes and the Benedicts.  The pancake of the day wasn't as good as the pineapple Pancake but it's not bad just not as impressive.  Definitely ask for the syrup to go w the pancakes.  They might give you a tiny one but I like to drown mine so definitely ask for two if you are a syrup lover.
,,,,,The breakfast burrito was meh.
,,,,,Hubby likes the hash.
,,,,,Careful where you park on the street cause I got a ticket!
,,,,,Went for an early breakfast 7am and the place was already in full swing.
,,,,,Parking is very limited... small lot and street parking.
,,,,,"Staff was warm and friendly.  Since it was our first time, our waitress was very helpful with menu selections and gave us plenty of time to decide."
,,,,,"I ordered the Snooze Classic with over easy eggs, pulled pork, hash browns and sour dough toast.  The toast was good... wished I had another piece. The eggs were a little too easy... when I cut the first bite a bunch of clear liquid ran out from the eggs all over my plate.  The pork was tender but I needed a little salsa or hot sauce.  I loved the hash browns... very flavorful."
,,,,,Overall... I would come back to try other items.
,,,,,Great food! Loved their food at their Fort Worth location and this place puts out great stuff as well. The breakfast burrito with bacon and egg can feed a small family of four and be sure to ask for extra green chili sauce. You can't go wrong either  if you decide to split the pineapple upside down pancake with a friend.

,,,,,"Houston, TX 77006"
,,,,,"Snooze, an A.M. Eatery is my go to brunch place in Houston! And while there are thousands of reviews on this place, I really believe that this restaurant lives up to the hype."
,,,,,"The only bad thing about this place is the parking! Well I guess there is always a long wait here too for brunch, but all good things come with time and the wait is worth it! But as far as parking goes, I've never gotten lucky and had a parking spot inside their tiny lot. 9 times out of 10 you're gonna have to find street parking in the neighborhood, but be wary of all parking signs! I've seen many people get towed here if you aren't careful. And wherever you do find parking, you're probably gonna have to walk a bit to get to the restaurant."
,,,,,"But regardless of the poor parking situation, this place sets the standard for all brunch places!! The food is always delicious, drinks are fresh and boozy when required to be, and the service is always friendly in a cool atmosphere. I normally come here on Sundays, and there is sometimes a local farmers market pop up next door. It's the perfect place to walk, look around, and kill some time while you wait for a table. Snooze is also perfect in that they have offer free coffee while you wait."
,,,,,"I've tried almost everything on the menu, but I would recommend any of their pancakes, eggs benedicts, or their SNOOZE BREAKFAST BURRITO. The breakfast burrito is huge, can easily feed 2-3 people, add in breakfast sausage on the inside, opt to get half of the green chili sauce and half of the ranchero sauce, utilize some of their yellowbird Serrano hot sauce, and you're set for a great morning."
,,,,,"Do yourself a favor and come eat here soon!! Personally I've found the earlier you go the better, as they get more crowded as people start waking up. You'll probably see me here on Sunday!"
,,,,,Wonderful experience and the food is so good!! I was not a huge fan of the corn beef hash. The meat definitely needs to be diced in with the hash browns. But the shrimp and grits was delicious. The chai latte was tasty as well.
,,,,,"So, the food is quite tasty in a diabetes-inducing kind of way in reference to pancakes and other sugar-laden treats.   The ambience, and I guess some diners like it, made us extremely uncomfortable. The music is super loud and jarring and not in sync with chill morning vibes.  Parking is a major hassle at this location.  But if u like blaring music and sugary treats, go check it out."

,,,,,Friendly!  Food was alright. Wait time of 2 hours is definitely not worth it to eat here.
,,,,,"Hi Tyler,"
,,,,,We’re sorry to hear you were so disappointed in your wait the last time you were in. We’d like to get a little more information and make this right. Would you mind emailing us at 
,,,,," with ""Montrose 12/12 Yelp"" as the subject? We hope to hear from you!"
,,,,,"We went here before covid.  I guess it's not their fault that it's so crowded, but I wish parking were better and we didn't feel so crowded inside.  The place was packed.  Servers were great, though, and so was the food.  I think it's just a symptom of the Heights being overcrowded."
,,,,,Mouth watering!!! Had such a good time. My boo and I really enjoyed our brunch after running errands.
,,,,,Pulled and found a spot really easy despite only enough private sports for 12 -14 vehicles . There is street parking but I'm glad I got into the lot. 
,,,,,"Walked in and was seated immediately. My server came right over and she was good- I could tell by her promptness, smell and swagger.; however, she still had to replace my silverware because my spoon was definitely not clean. The resturant is very clean and lively. The colors and lighting used gives the place life at all times. I ordered the Cortoda coffee espresso and it came in a shot glass -too hot for me to handle (I have delicate hands)My server got me a coffee mug and poured it into it. I was surprised that the it didn't reach halfway. It was strong-good and strong. I needed it for this morning. "
,,,,,I also ordered a small pineapple juice which was very good and sweet- I should have ordered a large one.
,,,,,Today I ordered  Ahhh La Carte! 
,,,,,"Bacon -Hmmm Bacon, 2 Eggs scrambled, extra crispy hash browns and fruit. "
,,,,,"The fruit was sweet and juicy, the bacon not only had a maple like smell but taste as well. The hash browns were cooked just right with a light tasting flavor. The eggs"
,,,,,"Amazing food, good drinks, and awesome service! Highly reccomend coming here for brunch!"
,,,,,"Wow! Thank you for your fantastic review, Nicki! We are thrilled that you loved your experience at Snooze and look forward to seeing you again. Happy Brunching!"
,,,,,I had been wanting to try this place out and it definitely met all the expectations I had. 
,,,,,Parking: They have a small lot but on a Saturday around noon your chances of parking there are very slim. There's street parking around the restaurant though. 
,,,,,"Food: Delicious!! I got The Snooze Classic. It comes with eggs, hash browns, your choice of meat, and toast, but you can trade the toast for a pancake for a couple of extra dollars. I traded mine for the chocolate chip pancake. It was the perfect amount of sweet. "
,,,,,"Staff: Friendly and very attentive. For a restaurant that is very busy, our waitress was very attentive. She took her time to list all her personal favorites and then talked about each section of the menu. It was greatly appreciated since our group were first timers."
,,,,,"First time going, won't be my last. Tasty food and good service! They listened well and the lady was in touch with us the whole meal making sure we had everything we needed. Thank you for great food and service !"

,,,,,My friends and I landed in Houston and took an Uber straight to the Pit Room with our luggage and all. Ahhhhhhh!!!! It was so goood!!! I got a beef rib weighing in at one pound for $22. The line was intimidating but went by quick. Lots of friendly employees and happy customers. The hype is real and worth it. We didn't know until after we ate but the friendly old man working there suggested we go next door to the Patio for drinks and customers like to order their food and eat it next door.
,,,,,"Beef rib, 5/5 amazing, juicy, meaty, thick "
,,,,,"Baked beans, 5/5 how do they make it that good?"
,,,,,"Mac and cheese ,4/5 I'm not a Mac and cheese person "
,,,,,"Grilled okras ,5/5 freaking delcious!  "
,,,,,"Queso and chips, 5/5 can I take some cheese home?"
,,,,,"Pickles, 5/5 I'd buy a jar."
,,,,,"Coffee bbq, 5/5 weirdly good and taste like mole."
,,,,,"Bbq sauce, 5/5 I could drink it. The sauce made the meat 10x better."
,,,,,What a gem. Brisket was moist without being fatty and had a GREAT flavor. There's no need to drive to the hill country for good bbq any more.
,,,,,Sunday morning till 10:30 AM they have breakfast tacos!!!!!!!
,,,,,PSA!! these breakfast tacos are bomb :) 
,,,,,Brisket beans eggs and cheese wowow.
,,,,,Would love a way to do an online order for pick up for more pandemic friendly service but I was fine waiting outside for these tacos they were so yum.
,,,,,"Great place to take out of town visitors. Nestled in the Museum District, the Pit Room has your typical feel of a barbecue joint with wooden booths and seats and fresh, hot barbecue plated in front of you onto metal trays."
,,,,,"The beef rib is a MUST here. It is HUGE and fall off the bone kind of tender with a good char. The tacos are good if you're looking for something a little lighter with a Tex-Mex flair (brisket tacos, pulled pork tacos), and the mac and cheese is one of my favorite sides. I wasn't a huge fan of the elote here because it had so much mayo it felt almost greasy but overall this is a very solid place to get some barbecue."
,,,,,"Came here because it had great reviews, but super sorry we wasted $100 in this restaurant. Had the brisket and it was so salty and had a funky texture. Mac and cheese lacked any flavor. The Beans were so over spicy, you couldn't enjoy them. 4 of us ate here, and not one of us liked our food or said we'd come back. Sorry Pit Room, need to step up your game a few notches, you lost a few customers here."
,,,,,Had take out from here before and it was great.
,,,,,"We went onsite on Friday night. Love this place. Friendly staff. Cold night otherwise the outdoor area looked inviting. Wife had the brisket tocos and loved them. I had pork ribs and jalapeño sausage. Very good, great smoke flavor. BBQ sauce is spicy and flavorful the way we love. Best Charro beans anywhere! Can't wait to swing by there for a breakfast taco."
,,,,,"If you're looking for mouth-watering bbq, look no further than The Pit Room. This gem is tucked away in the Montrose area. I had the moist brisket, beef sausage, mac n cheese, and tomato & cucumber salad. Wow. Just wow. I have to admit this was my husband's pick so I was a bit skeptical. But, my oh my, was I surprised when I sank my teeth into the scrumptious brisket. I ate every single bite. The bbq sauce was thick & creamy as well so, of course, I dipped my sausage and brisket in it."
,,,,,"The restaurant itself is small but they do have outdoor seating, including a patio that's pet-friendly."
,,,,,"Thankfully, we got there before the lunch rush because there was a long line out the door as we were leaving around 12:30 pm."
,,,,,I highly recommend this fantastic restaurant!
,,,,,Thanks for showing the love! Come back and see us soon!
,,,,,"Delicious and such a long line. First come, first serve seating, but this was pre-COVID times. A fan of everything and it's very filling! Highly recommend checking out :)"
,,,,,"I want to give a major shout out to the younger guy that was working near where you order on 2/9. I am from out of town and was asking for recommendations and he piped in with a couple of different options. Unfortunately one was sold out, but while I was sitting eating my meal more of that option was ready and he brought me a sample to be able to try. That was SO ABOVE AND BEYOND. If the manager would like to reach out I would love to try to verify the team member for recognition because I honestly felt so special and would recommend this place based on him alone. I mentioned I was from out of town and he really tried to ensure I got to try the best options. "
,,,,,"That being said DO NOT SKIP OUT ON THE BRISKET. That was hands down my favorite, SO TENDER. SO FLAVORFUL. AMAZING. But!!! The recommendation from the gentlemen behind the counter was foe the Turkey. Honestly, I was iffy about it. Not really excited. IT WAS AMAZING. I HIGHLY recommend you try it. I can't believe that would have been one of my last choices here. "
,,,,,I really wish I had got this team members name for a proper shout out. Hopefully I will find out and be able to update this post!
,,,,,"I've had the Pit Room several times and it always is so fresh. I had not tried the charro beans and elote til today; great choice! The beans had a spice, so beware but nothing no one can't handle. Oh and the side of pickles were different; they were cucumbers soaked in a unique vinaigrette or so. "
,,,,,Enjoyed lunch hour with my man and some good bbq.

,,,,,Food is mediocre to be honest.  Service was less than mediocre. Didn't even give us water when we sat down. Traveling from NYC & I looked up best brunch in Houston. Was really excited to eat good southern breakfast. Everything was JUST OKAY nothing spectacular or maybe I'm just a picky New Yorker.
,,,,,Came for brunch with family from out of town:
,,,,,"We got the aperol spritz, mimosas, donut burger, fruity pebble french toasts, the gumbo covered chicken fried steak & the shrimp & grits."
,,,,,"Everything was delicious!! My personal fav was the shrimp & grits! Everyone else loved the fried steak. My husband swallowed the donut burger in about 3 minutes. He said it was one of the best breakfast sandwiches he'd ever had. The fruity pebble French toast is about what you'd expect, I thought the bread was a little hard for French toast but the flavors were delish. We'll be back for sure! Awesome place to bring out of town guests!!"
,,,,,We came in from out of town and wanted a place with great food.  The wood and brick combination created a dark intimate atmosphere and ambiance.  The whiskey room is a site to see.  Their fried apple pie is one of the best apple desserts I ever ate. We loaded up on appetizers and enjoyed every one.  The beef short rip with au gratin potatoes was awesome.
,,,,,"My wife, daughter , and I went to Bosscat kitchen for a late dinner. I was intrigued by the large whiskey selection they have and wanted to test it out. "
,,,,,We were promptly sat when we arrived. The place has a really mellow ambiance and is good for conversation and groups. 
,,,,,They have a room that has international and national brands of whiskey on wooden racks lining the walls. The room can be booked for private tastings and dinner for about 10 people. 
,,,,,The whiskey menu is quite extensive. Felt like a kid in the candy store that can only have two items (drink in moderation). I ended up doing a flight of 3 different whiskies and it comes with a water dropper for whisky enhancement. 
,,,,,We ordered the cornbread that domes with sea salt butter. The cornbread kind of reminded me of jiffy butt not as sweet. They are small pieces that were kind of cold (would have been better warm). The butter must be mixed with the sea salt flakes as they come on top and would be overly salty if not. 
,,,,,"I had the bosscat burger the chefs way (includes grilled onions, jalapeño aoli, lettuce, and pickles. My wife had the same thing but not chefs way. Our little one had an apple crostada with vanilla ice cream. The burgers are ala carte so we ordered a side of fries. The food came out in a fair time but the waitress forgot to order our fries. I got through half of my burger before getting them. The burger was delicious. Meat was well seasoned and the aoli had the right amount of kick. The fries are homemade and bigger than steak steak fries and well with sea salt. "
,,,,,My daughters desert was warm and the Ice cream was tasty. Only negative was they used a lot of cinnamon sugar that made the crostada too sweet. 
,,,,,I would definitely come back to try another flight and more food.
,,,,,We ate here during Covid time so we took it to go. (Although inside seating was available.)
,,,,,"My to-go order was ready quickly, they included all needed cutlery, and even prepared me an Old Fashioned to go!"
,,,,,I had the mushroom flatbread which was filling enough as a meal.
,,,,,I will be back.
,,,,,Great drinks. Nice place to stop to meet a friend. Only reason to give it 4 stars is because it closes quite early!
,,,,,"Tasty food, good service, and fun!!! We tried Bosscat due to its huge amount of reviews and American Asian Fusion menu. It did not disappoint! Beautiful patio sitting and decor. We tried the pork belly poutine, pig candy, 12 hour short rib, and their fried apple pie. SO DELICIOUS! Definitely a twist on their food and it's all so tasty. Terry was our server. He was so personable and fun. We had such a great evening here! It was my cousin's birthday and Terry and Bosscat made it a birthday to remember. Thank you, Bosscat!"
,,,,,It's ok... drinks are good that's about it. Blueberry pie ehh bs press ehh forgot the names to the rest but it was also ehh. Just not enough flavor
,,,,,Great place for brunch! Great atmosphere! Can't wait to try at dinner! Very good drinks!
,,,,,Love the food and the vibe.  The place is a little hard to find but once you get there it is worth the trip.  The Chef's choice burger was excellent and the fries were cut thick.  The service was really amazing and it really felt like an old school pub.  The prices are a little high to justify 5 stars but it was a great place to have a solid meal.

,,,,,"No doubt one of the best sushi spots in Houston, on equal standings with MF Sushi, definitely ranked above Roka Akor. Every piece of sushi we had and every dish we ordered was a work of art and of superb quality (by Houston standards). All the raw items tasted quite fresh, without much of that strong fishy odor, yet still not comparable with the casual sushi restaurants in Japan. "
,,,,,"And with quality sushi here in the US, the exorbitant prices follow closely behind. I honestly do not feel it is worth dishing out close to $100 per person just to still feel hungry by the end of the meal. "
,,,,,#260
,,,,,"There are not enough words to describe how much I love Uchi! It's my favorite restaurant, not just in the Houston area but in the whole world! It's a MUST that my fiancé and I come here once a week! The service is superior and the food, while pricey, is completely worth it."
,,,,,Some of our favorites are:
,,,,,- Edamame (it's grilled and the best we've ever tasted)
,,,,,- Machi Cure 
,,,,,- Spicy Crunchy Tuna
,,,,,- Zero Sen
,,,,,- Tarabagani (king crab)
,,,,,- Sake Toro (salmon belly)
,,,,,- Kampachi (amberjack)
,,,,,TIP: Make a reservation! It's highly unlikely you'll get in unless you wait in line before it opens @ 5:00 PM.
,,,,,"Wow, what an amazing place! I am not even a big fan of sushi and I still loved it. My wife and I came here for happy hour and a long line was already forming before the place even opened. We got seats right at the sushi bar so we could watch the chefs in action. I think we ended up getting one of everything on the happy hour menu. I tried out the Takara nigori cold sake which was great. My favorites were the spicy crunchy tuna, machi cure, social pork, and the walu tempura. For dessert, we got the fried milk which was delicious. Even if you don't like sushi, def check this place out."
,,,,,"The food here is amazing. However, last night I was sitting at the table next to the restroom. I got up to use it - no one between me and the restroom.  A host or waitress comes running over shouting that I have to wear a mask to use the restroom. I had to go back to my table to get one. And then again walk to the bathroom - no one near me. Completely ridiculous and embarrassing."
,,,,,"Best. Experience. Best. Food. Uchi RULES! When you go- simple order ""whatever the chef wants"" you want be disappointed. "
,,,,,Not sure why yelp makes you add long reviews.
,,,,,"This is sad. I used to be a big fan of Uchi too. I went here a good 4/5 years ago and was so wowed with everything. I tried a lot of things too! My friend and I tried at least 15 dishes and I loved every single one of them. This time I came in, May 2019, I was so disappointed. I still ordered a good 15-20 dishes/sushi but nothing WOWed me . The only thing that was good to me was the hot rock waggu beef... but idk how you can mess that up.  "
,,,,,When I tried the walu walu I had no clue what I was tasting and had to look back what I ordered. 
,,,,,Nothing had a strong unique flavor to it . I have to say though. The fried milk here is wonderful and it works be the only reason why I would crave Uchi
,,,,,"Delicious. We have had sushi all over the world, including Japan. The way the garnish every single piece of nigiri differently blew us away. We went for a romantic dinner and it was worth every penny."
,,,,,"Overall great experience. Delicious food. VERY DELICIOUS. I was impressed with the taste and presentation of everything. Loved it all. Traditional Japanese food and some with a twist. Absolutely loved it. If I ever get a girlfriend, I'm going to take her there one day. haha"
,,,,,"I mean, what's left to say about Uchi? No contest, no question, undeniably the supreme sushi destination in Houston. Think I'm overstating? Just check out the overall rating AND the number of ratings compared to every other high end sushi destination in the area."
,,,,,"The quality of the fish is stellar, and the interpretations of each creation are so unique and delicious. As always, we had so many dishes, but the hands-down favorites are the foie gras (mind-blowing and even better than the seared foie gras I've had at French restaurants,) and the bluefin otoro. But every single thing we had was wonderful and exceptional, from start to finish."
,,,,,"Staff is gracious, and Nick is an outstanding server! He was incredibly polished, attentive, and spot-on with the recommendations."
,,,,,My foodie friend and I already have our next reservation on the calendar :)
,,,,,"Without a doubt, the Uchi offerings are the creme de la creme... the pinnacle... the very best sushi in the Houston area! I know there have been comparisons to MF Sushi, but MF isn't even a distant second to Uchi. They wish."
,,,,,"First of all, service was very friendly, welcoming, and they all actually appeared to be excited to be there! Our main server was spot on with poise, professionalism, and efficiency."
,,,,,"My foodie friend and I started with tender and delicious shishito peppers, and then the parade of excellence ensued: hamachi, salmon belly, anchovies, short rib, foie gras, and my absolute favorite, blue fin otoro. Wow, every single dish was outstanding. The foie gras was sublime - perfectly decadent flavor and texture. The otoro was so spectacular, even at $55 for 6 slices of sashimi, we placed a second order."
,,,,,"I can't eat sugar, but my friend ordered her ""favorite dessert in Houston,"" the Fried Milk. I ordered a pot of tea, and we finished the meal, certain that we will return soon."
,,,,,"And, to ensure that we do, they gave us each a voucher to use for our next visit. Winning!"
,,,,,"Exquisite as always. For special occasions, the chef's tasting is absolutely the way to go. My favorite dish so far was the salmon sashimi with golden kiwi and coconut Thai chili sauce with candied ginger. They have a very great and affordable happy hour though! Also make a reservation and get there early, because there's even a line to wait in for reservations. Also their blueberry cake with taro mousse inside and coconut lime ice cream is ahhhhmazing. The staff is always nice too and all of them (we had many different people bringing dishes) remembered my birthday! I like the cool ambiance too but it is very dim and busy inside"
,,,,,"Impeccable service, delicious food. Only regret was being so so late to catch the uchi hype train. Been travelling to Houston for almost 4 years now and only just made my first visit to Uchi. Won't be the last. I would make select recommendations, but I've only been once so haven't quite established favorites. I will say though, everything recommended by our server was a hit on our table that night. Edamame is charred, salty deliciousness - never had it like that before. All the tempura dishes were hits, we ordered the shag roll? Shaggy roll -- maybe? Twice? Desserts were fantastic too. 10/10."

,,,,,More details:
,,,,,We went there for dinner. The food was really tasty and it is nicely presented. The portion size was on the smaller side.
,,,,,"The staff was nice and very much listening to the requests of our large table (well I guess we did end up spending almost $3,000 ..."
,,,,,Overall? 
,,,,,"Great food, nice staff, high quality but a bit overpriced"
,,,,,"Super omakase.  My buddy and I had a memorable meal tonight.  We ordered the ten course omakase.  It was magnificent!  We had a terrific sushi chef who prepare our own special tasting menu.  We had delicate fresh fish, carefully prepared vegetables, meats, all paired with  sauces and beautifully presented.  We had such that included ahi, akamachi, hamachi, hamadan, inure paired with uni, kani, karei, shake, and toro.  We had wagyu beef cooked on a sizzling hot stone.  We had hot mushrooms with crispy rice.  An amazing combination of a central puddle of parsnip puree surrounded by roasted cauliflower and aparagus and topped with cashews.   Foie gras sushi.  Then desserts: fried milk and separately apple compote with rolled oats.  The service was excellent. A wonderful meal!"
,,,,,"Regardless if I'm coming in for dinner or their Sake Social, this place never disappoints! "
,,,,,"Dinner service starts at 5pm, with a line out the door before service even begins. They also do not seat incomplete parties, so make sure everyone arrives on time. Best thing about the Sake Social (besides the food and drinks) is that it's not limited to just the bar. Which means you can make a reservation for a table (highly encouraged). "
,,,,,Highlights of the night for us were:
,,,,,Hama Chili (3 pcs) - slight tickle on the tongue from the Thai chili with a touch of citrus from the ponzu sauce. 
,,,,,"Walu Walu (1 pc to share)- if you love escolar, this is the dish for you! I never had grilled escolar before and wasn't quite sure if I'd like it. Fish was flaky and grilled to perfection! Perfectly paired with yuzupon and candied citrus. "
,,,,,"Foie gras candy bar (2 candy bars) - this is an elevated and super elegant version of a snickers bar! Upon first bite you immediately taste the hazelnut, followed by the truffle caramel. That hint of truffle is so good! I honestly couldn't really taste the foie gras too much. I'll have to try it again. But nonetheless, great dessert! "
,,,,,"All three items were 5/5 for us. Each dish had varying textures and complimentary flavors. You read the description on the menu and go ""hmmm, I wonder how that would taste together"". Once you take that first bite, it completely takes you by surprise! The plating is beautiful and you can see so much care that goes into each dish. "
,,,,,"I don't know why it took me so long to come here for Sake Social, considering how much I love this place. Can't wait for the next happy hour here!"
,,,,,NOTE: complimentary valet
,,,,,First time at Uchi. Absolutely loved it! The food is excellent and the service is excellent. We sat at the sushi bar and really enjoyed watching the food being prepared. Save room for dessert !! The fried milk is probably the best dessert I've ever had! 
,,,,,( I only took a couple of pics!)
,,,,,Oh my Uchi!!!
,,,,,"What a magnificent sushi tasting experience. I recommend sitting at the bar. There are sushi Connoisseurs that will provide feedback of the best sushi that is in season! Mackerel was the winter best at the time. Let me tell you something.. these guys know what they are doing. They will not steer you in a wrong direction. With a nice glass of wine and sushi from Uchi, there isn't anything better! "
,,,,,"If you want to take your gal out for a  lovely sushi experience, UCHI IS THE BEST! Bravo staff!!!"
,,,,,One of my favorite places ever!
,,,,,"Unique dining experience, friendly waiters and interesting and fresh sushi"
,,,,,Had our early Valentine's dinner here and of course had the ten course chef's Omakase. The food was spectacular and we were really full at the end. We got super lucky and ended up with an extra dessert on the house because of our great waitress Dusty!  If you've been here before then you know the food is spectacular and If you haven't then what are you waiting for?!
,,,,,Absolutely phenomenal. I brought my boyfriend at the time for his birthday before a Rockets game and we ordered every single item off the sake social menu and it was tasty and flavorful to the last bite. I absolutely loved all of it!!!
,,,,,"I come to uchi at least once a year for the last 3 years to splurge and treat myself. This place practically never disappoints. Currently, they have hand sanitizer at the entrance when you walk in and all of the employees wear masks. We made reservations for 2 and were seated as soon as arrived. We always order the omakase, which is always an awesome surprise since the chef picks everything we eat. There's a few misses with some dishes, but definitely the majority are hits! I absolutely always enjoy all of the nigiri pieces they prepare and the wait staff is very friendly and always gives you recommendations on how to eat/when to eat. They also really try hard to make everything and enjoyable experience. We made one complaint that the wagyu dish was too salty, and they happily replaced the dish with a less saltier wagyu which was excellent. It's always a fun surprise eating here and I definitely plan on coming back again for omakase only. Well worth the bill which usually ends up greater than $200 and we are always full after experiencing all of these dishes."
,,,,,"If you're looking for top quality food and service in Houston, Uchi is one of the most popular restaurants.  It opened up in 2012 and came from Austin, Texas.  It's quite pricey, but I would definitely recommend going at least once for the experience (even if you're a food snob and hate fusion food)."
,,,,,"I recently went to a Uchi on a Friday evening at 6:30 pm with my girlfriend.  They have valet parking behind the restaurant, but we were lucky and found free street parking nearby.  We don't typically go to Uchi because there's always a long wait, and by no surprise, there was an hour wait when we arrived.  We didn't have any reservations unfortunately.  Luckily, there was open seating near the bar right away, and they actually serve their entire food menu there.  We opted for this option."
,,,,,"I looked over their drink menu and order the Kori Suika cocktail (sake, watermelon, lime, and mint) for $11.  They used a giant cube of ice in it, and I feel the cocktail was super small.  I finished it in a few sips because the ice took up most of the space.  It was really good though.  It tasted just like sweet watermelon juice.  Even the ice cube itself was frozen watermelon juice instead of water that could dilute your drink."
,,,,,We ordered a bunch of items from the menu including:
,,,,,1) Hama Chili for $18.50
,,,,,"*yellowtail, ponzu, Thai chili, orange supreme"
,,,,,5/5
,,,,,2) Hot Rock for $17.50
,,,,,"*wagyu beef, ponzu"
,,,,,5/5
,,,,,3) Gyumaki for $12.50
,,,,,"*grilled short rib, kimchi, Thai basil"
,,,,,3/5
,,,,,4) Zero Sen for $12.50
,,,,,"*yellowtail, avocado, shallot, cilantro"
,,,,,3/5
,,,,,5) Gyutan for $6/each nigiri (special)
,,,,,*beef tongue
,,,,,4/5
,,,,,6) Fried Milk dessert for $9
,,,,,"*toasted meringue, chocolate"
,,,,,3/5
,,,,,"The Hama Chili and the Hot Rock were the best items for us.  The wagyu beef that you cook yourself on the hot rock literally melts in your mouth.  I would definitely recommend ordering this.  The rolls were pretty disappointing to me, so I would avoid these ones.  The Fried Milk dessert is what they are known for, but I also didn't really enjoy it."
,,,,,"Overall, I do love Uchi.  There's always something new to try, and the quality of the food and service is on point every time we go.  Make sure to get reservations if you don't want to wait, and absolutely come with a wad of cash.  You will be making it rain with your dollar bills!"
,,,,,"Going to Uchi was an incredible experience. We went for boyfriend's birthday, and every single dish was amazing."
,,,,,I order the brussel sprouts and the kobucha and I can't decide which one I liked more because they both tasted seriously amazing.
,,,,,My boyfriend and his dad let the waiter pick menu items for them. They both loved the experience and thought everything tasted delicious! 
,,,,,"Menu items are generally pretty pricey at Uchi so if you go be prepared, but it is 100% worth it!"

,,,,,"I don't usually like ramen places for a host of reasons, but I had to give this place a try because it came highly recommended from more than one person. I ended up ordering the ""Slurp Up Cilantro,"" which was better than most ramen I've tried that is not homemade. The broth and the toppings were on the lighter side, so it tasted healthier than most ramen I've had. "
,,,,,"The real MVP of the night was the ""Spicy Vegan"" ramen that my friend ordered. The broth was SO creamy and flavorful. I will definitely go back at least one more time so that I can have a full bowl to enjoy."

,,,,,Wow ! I recommend the vegan ramen. I opted out on meat for my ramen because the creamy broth sounded good. It was. Try their takoyaki as well.

,,,,,"This place used to be my absolute favourite ramen place in Houston. Recently though, I feel like the quality has gone down? Not sure, but the flavors don't pop out at me like they used to and the broth feels too thick sometimes. Still my go to because it's still the best we've got in Houston, but I think unless they up their game someone else will come along and steal the throne. Oh by the way, I'm Japanese so I guess you could say I have a pretty high standard for ramen."
,,,,,"On another note, the jinya buns are to DIE FOR. Never had a bun that good anywhere else. Honestly, I want to go there just for the buns and get 10 of them."

,,,,,"Since I've been in Houston, this is one of my top favorite ramen spots to go to. My husband and I came with a friend of ours to this spot two months ago and we enjoyed our time here. I had ordered the Tonkotsu Spicy Ramen and my husband ordered the JINYA Tonkotsu Black Ramen. The bowls they came in were pretty steep so there was more ramen than broth (which I'm okay with because I love the noodles). "
,,,,,Tonkotsu Spicy- I wish I had a picture of mine but it really was that good. The broth was flavorful and not too heavy. The actual noodles tasted fresh and smooth. I ate the whole thing.
,,,,,"JINYA Tonkotsu Black- My husband liked his ramen, as did I. It was more on the peppery side but still well-balanced with flavor. "
,,,,,"Also, parking wasn't too hard to find. The parking garage had 3 floors. Even though it was a big parking garage, we had to park on the 3rd floor because the first two floors were kinda packed (we came on a Tuesday afternoon)."
,,,,,"Hi Christi - Thank you for your great review. We're glad our ramen stacks up against your other ramen-dining experiences, enough that you brought more friends and family with you! We thank you for your business and your kind words, and we look forward to your next visit."

,,,,,Pretty good place for ramen. We came on a Sunday evening and it was still pretty packed. We had to wait 10-15 mins before getting a table. The interior is nice and cozy and I liked the huge communal table in the middle. We got the salmon bun (pretty good) and the spicy chicken ramen. The ramen wasn't that spicy but luckily the table side chilly sauce did the trick. The broth was flavorful and the meat was tender and juicy. One bowl was enough for me and my wife. The service was pretty good and they have a free parking garage right next door. It looks like a nice date place or a cool spot to get some ramen with some friends.

,,,,,This is my go to ramen place. Nothing I have eaten here is just fine. Everything is amazingly delicious. This is one of those only ramen places that serves a lot of chicken broth options. Spicy Chicken Ramen is the star on the menu. Crispy chicken is one that you shouldn't miss. Try it with the hot sauce on the table. Tastes much better that way. Always wonder what brand that hot spice is. I'd love to have that readily available at home to eat with other foods.

,,,,,"Me and a group of my 10 friends decided to go to JINYA around 7pm. Because there was such a large group of us, we had a wait around 45 minutes which ended up turning into an hour wait. The waiting area is very small, but there is a bar which makes the wait more enjoyable. We ended up getting seated 8 together and 2 separately. They sat us around the center of the main round table in the middle. We kindly asked the two strangers separating our group to switch spots with us which they willingly did. "
,,,,,"As a vegetarian, I was happy to see more than one vegetarian ramen option on the menu. I ordered the vegetarian soup ramen which tasted exactly how it sounds. The overall flavor was very mild and salty. I appreciated the fact that you can ask for mild, medium, or spicy levels. There is also chili sauce on the tables to flavor the ramen if you do not enjoy yours. Although I did not enjoy the ramen I chose, the vibe of JINYA was enjoyable. The lights were dim and the decoration was nice. I would advise, if going to this JINYA location, arrive very early especially at dinner time as there will be a wait and they do not do reservations. "
,,,,,"Parking around midtown is always a bit complicated, but I appreciated the fact that there was a huge parking garage connected to that plaza that had a good amount of open space. "
,,,,,"I would go to this JINYA again, maybe just earlier and order the other vegetarian option, the spicy creamy vegan ramen."

,,,,,"Update 10/21/18: I've been coming to Jinya since 2015 and I have to say that the service has changed for the better. When I first started going to Jinya the service has always been okay, why? Because they profile people based on looks. So if they felt that you're not going to tip then it's half a** service you'll get. I'm so happy that the owner reached out to me and sincerely apologize to me on the lack of service I've been getting. I know I might look like a college student but I always tip 20 percent or higher why? Because someone like me who use to work for the restaurant industry knows how it feels when you're doing an awesome job and ends up getting zero zip zilch nada in tips. Now on to the food, I can say just about everything on the menu is amazing, my favorite dish is the Tonkotsu Spicy & the Tonkotsu black with the thin noodles and extra eggs, yum yum. This place is my favorite Ramen place to go to and I will continue to spend my money here as long as the service stays the same, keep up the great work. "

,,,,,"The service has actually got better. When I first started going there 5 months ago, the service was always sub par. The reason why is because they felt that I wasn't going to tip. Maybe because I look really young. I'm always generous when it comes to tipping because I work at restaurant. After several times I wrote my critique on their receipt, the services has actually changed. So I am satisfy. The food there is amazing. "
,,,,,Food- 5/5
,,,,,Service- 4.5/5
,,,,,Came in and no one greeted us until 4 minutes later but it's okay I guess no one saw us .
,,,,,"I ordered the Crispy chicken as appetizer it was pretty good , it was hot and crispy ."
,,,,,"I ordered the Tonkotsu Black as a main course I thought it was good, but since I never ate Japanese food. I didn't think it was the best. Out of 1-10 I would give my main course a 7. "
,,,,,"At the end I ordered the Annin Tofu, it was very good I'll give it a 8. I didn't expect it to taste that well. "
,,,,,"My drink that I ordered was pretty strong but it was decent. I got the Lycheetini , it was ehhh. "
,,,,,"The server her name is Erin. She was attentive and gave us a great service. I never ate Japanese food before and she gave me the best options to get, and yes it was worth the price I paid. Now it wasn't the best but good enough. She recommended a lot of good stuff on the menu. "

,,,,,"JINYA is always a good choice. My last visit we went in on a Friday night, and had to wait 45 minutes. Not too bad since we found a spot at the bar. Once our table was ready we shifted to our seats. Ramen always good, I would not think there is anything overly special about the Ramen here. Its good, its not too expensive, and there is a great atmosphere. "

,,,,,We ordered Jinya buns - must eat if you go to Jinya - and spicy chicken ramen. Ramen was good and the noodles were perfectly cooked. Everything tasted delicious but I took out one star because the ramen wasn't very hot. 
,,,,,Jinya remains as my top ramen place in Houston!

They don't serve udon noodles, flavored edamame, and the spices are milder than what you would expected. This doesn't mean the food is terrible. Just not as flavorful as your traditional ramen spot. If you want satisfaction I wouldn't have this as first on my list for spots to try. Also, the SAKE was great and I enjoyed the appetizers."

,,,,,"I always get the tonkotsu black with the thick noodles, add ground pork, and it never disappoints. I've always brought my son because they have an incredible kids meal that includes chicken ""nuggets"", ramen, rice and some other sides for $7 (don't quote me, I just remember it's cheap). It's honestly enough food for an adult, but you gotta have a kid with you - whomp whomp. "

,,,,,Finally... A ramen place close to home!  
,,,,,"I tried the spicy chicken ramen since I figured the broth would be less fatty. I added fried garlic, which made a world of difference, and next time, I'll try the thicker noodles instead. My only complaint is that there just wasn't enough meat. Jimmy had the spicy miso (chef's special), which was definitely more flavorful. The only thing he would do differently next time is make it spicy and add an egg. You have the option to add other ingredients, so make sure you check out the list. "
,,,,,"The portions were generous, so I would have liked to see the option to select a small or large bowl because I don't like to be wasteful and can't finish their portion. "
,,,,,"The kids' meal isn't advertised, but they have one and it is a very good size and reasonably priced. I loved the variety too!  You get crispy chicken, rice, fries, churashi (sp?), and ramen!  It's more than enough food for me, and it was only $7.95. "
,,,,,"Lastly, the service is great. Everyone's friendly and accommodating, but there is a bit of a wait, so don't come starving."
,,,,,"Dear JINYA, I just wanted to say...ramen love with you. My boyfriend and I came here on a Thursday night around 8 and it was crowded but the wait wasn't too bad. We sat at the ramen bar in the back and I had the spicy chicken ramen with an extra egg and my boyfriend ordered the spicy tonkotsu ramen. Ramen came out sizzling hot and the broth and noodles were cooked to perfection. The egg added a nice touch. I wish I had more room in my belly to do a noodle refill for $2.50. That's a pretty sweet deal. I also highly recommend the lychee mojito. It's light and refreshing. For dessert we had the mochi. One order comes with 2 balls cut in half. They have matcha and chocolate and you can mix and match. The inside is nicely dimmed in a tight space giving off a ramentic vibe. Perfect for date night. Highly recommend."
,,,,,"I'm a bit disappointed. I loved Jinya the first time I went to this location, but the second time? Not so much."
,,,,,"My friend and I shared the Pork Chashu Bowl, (hoping that it would be as amazing as Ramen Bar Ichi's). It wasn't. The egg was overcooked, it was not yolk-y at all. Some of the pork was a bit tough. I ordered the Tonkosu Black Ramen since I really enjoyed it last time.  Unfortunately, It lacked flavor and the pork chashu was a bit too fatty for my liking. My egg was almost completed cooked through, there hardly any yolk oozing out of the egg. "
,,,,,"I'm aware that Jinya is a chain, so it's going to be inconsistent depending on which location you go to. I probably came on a bad day."

The food was just okay but the Brussels sprout appetizer was so unappealing, scorched for real...brought to the table in tyvek nuclear suit (kidding) that plate of burnt unfriendly brussel sprouts seemed to be scolding us, stealing our joy and daring us to try to eat it.

,,,,,"I have high expectations from ramen places in Houston, especially with Jinya considering how popular they are but in my opinion it's pretty good but not great ramen. The chasu and egg were nearly perfect. I was expecting the fried brussel sprouts to be similar to Uchi or Tatsuya but these Jinya brussel sprouts are battered and fried and have no flavor. I prefer the Uchi and Tatsuya versions that have a lot of fish sauce umami yumminess. The tonkotsu black ramen was not as flavorful as I wanted. The broth ended up being kinda bland, and I didn't finish my bowl which never happens with me and ramen because I don't waste food. I left Jinya still hungry. "
,,,,,"However, if Jinya were to open up in Dallas they would probably be in the top 2 ramen joints of DFW because DFW has shitty ass ramen compared to Houston and Austin."

I did order the Tonkutsu Spicy ramen, and had good expectations. Now, honestly for me personally the broth felt too rich, and the noodles where far too thick. This could easily be a reflection of my personal tastes and not the actually quality of the ramen. But for how hyped up this place is the ramen was actually pretty sub par, I have definitely had better. Nonetheless, they were extremely friendly, and had a great ambiance."

I'm guessing that the people waiting were for three or more. "
,,,,,"As soon as we sat down, our waitress asked us for our drink orders and soon afterwards asked for our entree requests. I decided on the Tonkatsu Black with the chicken karate and salad sides while my husband opted for the pork chashu. I enjoyed my choice. My husband liked his but thought that his meal was a little salty. "

,,,,,Love the atmosphere some of the best Ramen you can but in a chain restaurant staff is great and prices def a regular downtown Houston
,,,,,"Lychee Martini was great, Ramen was amazing, service was mediocre. I will definitely be going back, though and looking forward to trying other items on their menu. Appetizers, small bites and tacos look and sound great. Small establishment so long waits, but the food is worth it."

,,,,,"This is definitely the ramen place that I frequent the most in Houston, not because I think it's the best tasting, but because my friends all LOVE this place. Honestly not sure why this ramen shop gets all the hype compared to the other places. "
,,,,,"Jinya gets an extra star for being vegan/vegetarian friendly; usually there isn't such an option for them at a ramen shop. It also wins in location/ease of parking. Close to downtown and has a dedicated parking garage. Their seasonal offerings are usually my favorite and is what I would recommend, like the kaarage ramen, which is indeed excellent. Simple toppings but excellent fried chicken and good broth flavor without being too heavy. I find the normal menu tonkotsu broth to be too heavy without the depth of flavor that other places like Tatsuya have. Also they are inconsistent with the quality of the ajitama egg. You can skip the poke tacos too; you'll find fresher poke elsewhere. Even though I give this place only 3 stars, I'll be back for sure."
,,,,,"Hi Tiffany - Thanks for your review. Please know that three years ago when I decided to invest in this restaurant concept, the notion of ""hype"" was furthest from my mind. I thought the market in Houston was lacking an established ramen concept, so I followed up on JINYA's franchising opportunities as the brand had proven itself successful in the Los Angeles market."
,,,,,"I appreciate your kind words, but please know if you ever receive a seasoned egg that doesn't meet your personal standards, let your server know and he or she will offer you another. We serve upwards of 1,000 eggs per day, so by the sheer laws of probability, there are going to be eggs that don't have the custard yolk that we aim for. Moreover, our poke bowls are prepared with fresh ingredients daily."

,,,,,"There is no shortage of Asian restaurants in Houston. Today was a good day to try one of the many since we had some time to make a pass at one of them in Midtown Houston en route to Galveston to catch our cruise. We were the first customers at 10:58 AM on a Sunday and it opens at 11am every day.  In 20 minutes half the restaurant filled with Ramen-hungry customers like us.  And in 40 minutes, every seat in the House was taken.  The street construction was obviously not a deterrent; which tells me two things-Jinya brings in the Houston locals that live close and love eating here AND this place MUST serve really great food. True on both."
,,,,,"Now you can pick the specials, or your can build a ramen bowl-noodle, protein, and broth.  Today's choices that the 3 of us shared was the recommended popular, Sprouting up Ramen; delicious in my book, although the thicker noodles do fill you up quickly and the brussel  sprouts are a bonus. The other dishes shared, JINYA Tonkotsu Black, which they were happy to sub the thin noodles on my request, and the JINYA signature bun.  "
,,,,,Delicious all around and service was attentive.  Nice surprise to see vegan options such as Vegetable broth or spinach noodles
,,,,,"Will gladly dine again and try something new when in the area and get their friendly greeting ""Hey!"" that's hollered throughout the restaurant by the entire kitchen staff to EVERY customer coming in to eat.  It sure is a nice signature Asian style of Howdy Y'all."

,,,,,"I love this place! The ramen is great and flavorful with huge portions and the restaurant is so trendy and cool. I really loved the vibe and the people there. The only reason i'm giving 4 stars is because the security/ police officer there was weird af. I don't know if he was told to watch us or what but he literally stared at us and only us the entire time we were there.... in a full restaurant. We were well dressed so I'm confused. Anyway, def great spot to bring someone if you want to be cool and different."
,,,,,"Hi Jasmine - Thank you very much for the stars. We greatly appreciate it. Also, we will have a word with our hired security staff.

,,,,,"A homeless guy came up to me out on the street, said he hadn't eaten in four days. I told him, ""Man, I wish I had your willpower"" then I made a 360 degree turn and walked on in to my girl Jinya for a late lunch. "
,,,,,"It's in Midtown off Louisiana next to Piola on the ground floor of the Mix @ Midtown mixed use complex that has the 24 Hour Fitness up on the top floor. They all share a tiny parking garage that fills up rather quickly. The parking situation isn't great but if it won't scare me off for the gym, it won't scare me off for food which I like much better than the exercise."
,,,,,"Jinya is sleek and shiny inside. The decorating flourishes are nice and attempt to cultivate a relaxing environment. The inside is unfortunately quite reverberatey and loud. The music is too loud, even a non-Ferengi would want it to come down a few decibels at lunch. Even though the resto was not peak full it still felt like I needed to know sign language or just draw pictures on napkins and slide them back and forth across the table to my dining companion. Or you could just shout at your dining companion like you in the club, trying to holla at a spicy fellow patron over the loud music."
,,,,,"This is a chain, which adds in a confusing element to the exotic mystique and allure of the cuisine of Eastern traditional cultures. The same as you shouldn't trust a bagel or bialy baked by anyone that doesn't look like the spitting image of a hardy shtetl laborer with sensible Ashkenazi chest hair poking out from the top of a mostly unbuttoned shirt, so too would you expect something of the ""Real McCoy"" to be behind the production of an authentic ramen experience. It's a chain so it is just a bit different than the traditional mom and pop place where you feel like they adopted you into their family the first time you dine at their restaurant. Ohhh, okaachan :(("
,,,,,"For an ""authentic"" ramen shop the prices are of course higher than the kind in plastic packs you buy in bulk out of the supermarket when you are riding the struggle bus until the wheels fall off - but they are in the same price range or cheaper than the other hipster congregations. The cheapest ramen offering is the veg one ringing up at $9.80 but the crowd favorites are in the $11-13 range (tonkotsu spicy at $11.80) as a base before you add in the other stuff for a few bucks a throw for an egg, chicken soboro, or more."
,,,,,"The spicy chicken ramen (SCR) is a crowd favorite as one of the most accessible offerings since most people are generally familiar with - and a fan of - at least one of those things. Just like how Dave Attell wanted to name his child Pizza Pussy Santa since everyone likes at least one of those things and the leader of the free world likes grabbing at least one of them. I like this way of thinking because it is true and transparently honest. For example everyone likes at least one of the following: gay porn, kindness from others, and free money. Everyone also likes at least one of the following: kittens, the Bolshevik Revolution, and clean water."
,,,,,"SCR starts at $11.50 and provides you chicken broth, chicken chashu, spinach, spicy bean sprouts, green onion, thin noodles, and your choice of heat level from mild-spicy-hot. At time of writing there are 259 yelp reviews on the biz page that mention the SCR so it's about as popular as Beyonce."
,,,,,"I like things as hot as they go since I am on an endless search for The Merciless Pepper of Quetzalacatenango, and nothing really delivers a hot heat experience like I want. I am a true spicehound. I asked the waitress to make this as hot as they could. It was not hot. On a scale from 1-10 I would give this a 2. Agu Ramen's hottest level (which the GM gave me an explicit warning about before agreeing to provide it to me) looking atomic red was maybe a 4 if I was being generous. So Agu Ramen makes 'hot' hotter than Jinya does, but neither makes it hot enough to matter on the heat index alone. When I order something hot I expect it to hurt so it is my mistake to expect something hot enough for me to take notice. "
,,,,,"But other than that, the tip of the hat largely ends up in Jinya's favor at price point and size of the bowl. I read many yelp reviews saying this was a tiny portion. I am not a delicate little bird, I am a real thug coming through a buffet line, and I could not finish my bowl of SCR. "
,,,,,"An experience at this location of the Jinya chain is reliable for kind and pleasant service, a clean and welcoming atmosphere, and very accessible ramen offerings for the average person who is not familiar with ramen culture simply thinking of it as a bowl of soup. If the music were turned down that would be a big upgrayedd to the experience so each table would need to do a little less shouting to be heard and cumulatively that would make the interior not just look nice but have a better feeling of SERENITY NOW to pair with a not-as-spicy-as-would-be-loved chicken ramen."
,,,,,Mordecai and Rigby would suggest a name change to Jin-yeah-yuh.

,,,,,"If you haven't been here you are behind or new to Houston. This is the best ramen outside of China town. Yes, it's a chain but it's absolutely incredible. The spicy chicken ramen is my favorite! (Try it inferno!! And get a seasoned egg and garlic to go with it) The soup is so flavorful, hearty, and has incredible bouncy noodles. I love to start with a seaweed salad. It's good, but kinda small. The chicken chashu bowl is also yummy but really get the ramen. I've tried other ramens they offer but always come back to the spicy chicken. Everyone is different and ramen is very subjective to what you like so try different ones! The service is usually fast, however they are always busy so patience may sometimes be required to be seated and to get more water, etc. "

,,,,,Honestly....Truly....this place is just okay. I would give it 2 stars but our bartender was nice so I'll make it 3. 
,,,,,"Ive had JINYA bookmarked for months as a ""Must Try"" and i finally decided to check them out. My first impression walking in was that it seemed much smaller than i thought and it had a weird sewer smell. Still, We decided to sit at the bar and was greeting right away by our bartender. "
,,,,,"I ordered the spicy chicken ramen and my friend order ordered the creamy vegetable ramen with edamame. Neither of us were a fan. Mine was pretty bland. From the noodles to the chicken.and broth. I added some of the Ramen Seasoning but was hesitant when they described the ingredients to the seasoning as ""everything under the sink""... the edamame however was very salty :/ but sort of helped add flavor to my pallet."
,,,,,Although I'm glad i finally was able to give this place a try it definitely won't be a go to for Ramen needs.
,,,,,"Hi Nia - Thanks for your review. I'm sorry you did not enjoy our ramen, though I should mention we have more than a dozen types of ramen bowls to choose from, and not every dish is going to be a homerun, depending on your preferences. We're always happy to swap out a selection if it fails to meet your expectations."
,,,,,"Regardless, we appreciate your following through with your ""Must Try,"" and I asked the bartender about the ""Everything under the sink"" comment you mentioned, and she says she probably meant to say ""Everything including the kitchen sink,"" though I would have preferred she responded appropriately: Our ramen seasonsing contains soy sauce, garlic, jalapenos and seaweed."

,,,,,Why 5 stars? Because this was exactly what I hoped for from a trip into Houston.

,,,,,"I was visiting my parents in Houston and texting back and forth with an old friend from college, trying to find somewhere to meet up for dinner. It turned out that he'd never had legit ramen before, and once I found out that insane fact, I knew that we had to visit JINYA. "
,,,,,"He went with the Tokyo Tonkotsu ramen, while I ordered the JINYA Tonkotsu Black. We were tempted to go with one of the chicken broths, but for his first time eating ramen, it felt like it needed to be pork broth. We ended up sampling each others and both like mine more, but he was quite happy with his. I hope this is the start of him becoming a ramen fanatic, but you never forget your first!"
,,,,,We also ordered a few other snacks:
,,,,,"-Poke Tacos: I don't actually remember if we went with the salmon or the spicy tuna, but I do know that they were really solid!"
,,,,,-Brussels Sprouts Tempura: I had to try these out since they were so often mentioned in the highlights
,,,,,"-JINYA Bun: This was my favorite part of the entire meal. The ramen was great, but this was an absolutely amazing bun - possibly the best I've ever had."
,,,,,"We only had about a 20 minute wait at peak dinner time, a few days before Christmas. The only bummer was that I couldn't put my name on the list until my friend arrived, even though he was only a few minutes away. I get it, but wish they could be more flexible with this rule. If they call me and my friend isn't there yet, why not just move onto the next person? Either way, this was an awesome experience!"
,,,,,"Hi Brett - Thank you very much for the awesome, comprehensive review. I'm glad you enjoyed our ramen and that you received good service while you were here.

,,,,,Jinya is definitely my most favorite ramen restaurant! I'm always craving it and I always get the same ramen lol.
,,,,,Every time I come here I get the garlic lovers cha cha cha and it never disappoints. Except maybe this last time I was kind of not super excited about it but the other 4 times I've been it's been pretty consistent. Nice and creamy and full of flavor. I always add an extra egg. And I freaking love thick ramen noodles! Soo good!
,,,,,Appetizers are good too! I always get takoyaki and the karaage chicken isn't bad. Ask for extra lemons! 
,,,,,Tried panna cotta for the first time and it made my tastebuds happy. 
,,,,,It gets busy pretty quickly and parking is kind of hard to find but yes you can park across the street where the garage is for free.

,,,,,Good ramen place in downtown Houston. It isn't the best ramen I've had but it is a solid ramen place. We got the Jinya Tonkotsu Black and Sprouting Up ramen.

,,,,,Mom was visiting me for 12 days and I know she loves soup in cooler weather.
,,,,,She loves what I usually order which is the vegetarian ramen bowl here made with chicken stock. Chicken stock gives it that extra dash of flavor.
,,,,,Mom added tofu to hers and I added Brussel Sprouts.
,,,,,We both savored every bite and spoonful! Yum Yum Yummy!!!
,,,,,Portions are generous so we both took almost three fourths of quart containers of our leftovers home with us.
,,,,,Believe it or not they made a great leftover meal one evening we didn't feel like cooking or going 
,,,,,out.
,,,,,"I like that they seated us at a table for 4 so we had our own table, though I don't mind the long communal tables. It's a nice way to meet new people because usually everyone is very friendly."

,,,,,Owner
,,,,,UPDATE 2/22/17
,,,,,Hello CJ M. - Thank you very much for the follow-up. It is supremely useful to us. I have initiated a thorough investigation into the incident to determine who is (was) responsible for such poor service. I apologize again and reiterate that this type of service is not -- and will not -- be tolerated.
,,,,,"I sincerely hope that we can earn back your business. You mention returning in a month or two. If and when you do, please make sure you ask for any of my managers on duty. They will make sure you receive the service you deserve."

,,,,,Jim H. Wang
,,,,,Owner
,,,,,"Hello CJ M. - Thank you for your review. First, as we do with all negative Yelp reviews, I would like to apologize for your experiences at our restaurant. I appreciate and welcome all constructive criticism as it helps us improve our station. To that end, I would like to ask you for some follow-up information so that I might get to the bottom of these issues. In doing so, I hope to address each of your points to the best of my ability."
,,,,,"1) Volume. I agree that loud music is not for everyone. In fact, I prefer dinner over soft music. However, JINYA's restaurant concept is geared towards a trendy, loud atmosphere. And this is, unfortunately, one of the many guidelines we are legally bound to follow as a JINYA franchise. Regardless, I will relay your message to our corporate headquarters."
,,,,,"2) Service. I am constantly making staff-policy changes to improve our service, but in this regard I could use your help. Can you provide specific examples of how your service was ""bad,"" or more specifically, how our servers ""are almost always mean to you""? Please know this is wholly unacceptable, and a few more specific details from you would help me in the event that I should sanction said server(s) and/or send them on their way. "
,,,,,"3) Wait times. You also mentioned that it takes ""forever to receive your food."" May I ask approximately how long you have waited for your food to arrive? This information will prove extremely useful in the event there is something in our assembly-, delivery-, and cook-process that needs fixing. During peak dinner hours (or when the waitlist is at or near an average 45-minute wait for a party of two), the ramen bowls typically take an average of 20-25 minutes from time of ordering to arrival at your table. Factors such as an influx of to-go orders and large parties of 10 or more can affect wait times, as well. During off-peak hours, our wait times for the ramen bowls are considerably shorter at approximately 15-20 minutes. Again, mistakes or ""audibles"" by customers can create inevitable delays, but our chefs and front of house staff work very hard to keep service on track."
,,,,,"To be fair, sometimes we miss the mark. And when we do, we try our best to make things right by our customers. But if we aren't able to register customers' complaints when they are inside the restaurant, this makes our job much more difficult. Regardless, please know that my entire staff and I take your review very seriously and want nothing more than to do by right by you, especially since you said you had been one of our regular customers. "
,,,,,"We appreciate your business and your time spent bringing these issues to my attention. If you change your mind and decide to visit us again, please ask for one of my floor managers, Keith, Wynne or Raul. They will do everything in their power to ensure these issues are resolved and that your stay is vastly superior to the ones you have described."

,,,,,Jim- 
,,,,,"Thank you for replying, that in itself is appreciated. For the example you asked for, I would say the worst experience happened just last month, the last time we went. Was an obscure weekday, no wait, later in the eve, not a lot of people there. We were immediately seated and then we waited, and waited, and waited. It was almost unbelievable, but sadly not surprising as we always seem to get stuck with a bad server/service, but not ONE person came to our table. We didn't even have anyone bring us water, our table was bare. For over 12 minutes. "
,,,,,"We were staring at the servers, trying to Jedi-mind-trick someone into paying attention to us; but most were standing around in the back, one on a phone, others chatting. I have no objection to any server social time, I was a server for years, I like happy servers and laid back attitude, but this was out right neglect and willful laissez-faire towards customers. (There is a general attitude that they don't give a crap about customers; quantity trumps quality when it comes to how they get their tips and really couldn't care less.) "
,,,,,"We were about to get up to leave (12 minutes had now ticked by with no one coming to our table, it was as if we didn't exist) when I grabbed a young looking kid and begged him to take our order and bring us water. He said he wasn't our waiter but would find our waitress. He instead came back, apologized (he seemed new, and flustered) and said he would take our order for her--she haughtily acknowledged us as he took our order (she was serving the table NEXT to ours, girl wtf, you saw us sitting there dying for over 10 minutes, how rude), and I almost asked her if anything was wrong (hey we all have bad days but damn girl) the guy did all of the work and I point blank asked him at the end if he would get the tip, as I didn't want her to take it. (Crazy right?) She FINALLY came up to the table at the very end and asked ""everything taste good?"" And last we saw of her. "
,,,,,"The food itself took at least 35 minutes to get to us (we were slowly turning to starving statues and made us late to our movie) and I grabbed flustered kid again and begged him to check on our food. (It wasn't busy, wtf was going on?!) He said ""oh right, your food, I'll go see if it's ready"" lol like as if he forgot we were there to eat. It was warm, not hot, so obviously was sitting there for awhile while we died of neglect lol. "
,,,,,"So anyways, we always seem to have rude/uninterested staff when we go there. Maybe more coaching, training, more staff on so they can spend time dedicated to each table? Trust falls? Who know, just my two cents. Maybe in a month or so we will drop by and see if anything changed. We live next door. Thanks, good luck!"
,,,,,"Servers suck. Super loud. Takes forever to get your food. Not quite sure what all the fuss is about, we live close by but yet can't seem to bring ourselves to go as much as the flock of zombies that cram themselves in there. Waiting for a table 10-20 people on the street? C'mon. I love ramen, but it's not that good. But hey if they want their ramen, cool. Good for them. Don't get me wrong, food is ok, ramen+broth+chicken. Cool. But we have had consistent BAD service every time we go there. And we have been there, I'd say, 10 times, and take out at least the same amount. You have to beg for someone to be nice to you (bartender is so unpleasant, I cringe when I have to pick up my take out) and take your order. It's loud, like really loud (cool, nbd to some and I'm sure some people like the bustling loud, but after a long day I'm not into shrieking and screaming about my day across the table), and again, service sucks; they are almost always mean to you, it's not that they are just busy, we've gone when it's not busy and they are they same aloof, don't-give-a-f^ck-attitude. I've watched them stand around in the corner and joke around while we sit and wait to even be acknowledged; and hey I get it, have fun, but be nice to me, serve me, we have almost gotten up and left before because no one comes to our table to even give us water. I have stopped a random waiter before to please-take-our-order-because-we-are-starving-to-death-waiting-for-anyone-to-come, lol. I've had to force myself to give 20% tip sometimes but grit my teeth and do it even though they usually don't deserve it. (And I'm always a 20%+ tipper) "
,,,,,"But in all- really small, overhyped, loud, busy, not that nice servers & a headache when you leave just for some average ramen. #pass"
,,,,,My fiance took me for the first time and I love JINYA!! I told the witness that it was my first and what would she recommend. Crystal was so patient and went over the menu.

,,,,,"This has been my favorite restaurant in Houston for years. I have gone 2-3 times per month for a few years now. The ramen is still the best in Houston, but I've gotten so disappointed these last few months. Prices have ticked up over time (normal) but they are giving you less food for the higher price. They stopped giving spinach as an add on and while they used to give 3 sheets of seaweed now they only give 1 - for a higher price!! I just can't swallow paying $23 for the same bowl of ramen I used to pay $16 for and I'm getting less food. Currently searching for other ramen places in Houston."
,,,,,I LOVE Jinya. I am here about once per week for a bowl of ramen. The Karagge chicken ramen and wonton chicken ramen are my favorites. Order it without the spice and then you can add as much or as little as you want from the spicy sauce available at the table. It gets pretty packed and hard to get a table unless you show up pretty early for dinner. I usually call in the order and it's ready 20 minutes later.
,,,,,This place is pretty on par with all the top notch Ramen places in the bay area.
,,,,,Luckily for me I relocated to Houston alone... so I usually just skip the line and get a seat at the bar. It's open seating there and I can be in and out within 30 mins.
,,,,,It's a little pricey and each topping is an extra $2.. which can really add up. Almost $20 for a bowl with tip.
,,,,,The broth is really good. I like to come here when it's really cold and I want a treat.

,,,,,"I'm really picky when it comes to ramen because I grew up eating authentic, Japanese ramen. When I try a ramen restaurant in the US, I always try it out with an open mind. "
,,,,,"I love the interior to this place. If you do not like lounges or dimly-lit restaurants, this may not be the place for you. "
,,,,,"I liked that they had a nice selection of ramen to choose from. I ended up ordering their most popular ""Jinya tonkatsu black"" ramen. I requested menma and corn on the side. "
,,,,,The broth was VERY creamy and rich. Some people may like/prefer that. It was to my liking and I actually like their noodles since they were thinner than most ramen restaurants I've tried. It had a nice little kick to it but not overly spicy so that was nice!
,,,,,"I did not like their menma (bamboo shoots). So far, all of the ramen restaurants I've tried, have very seasoned, flavorful, thinly cut bamboo shoots. This place literally had sliced thick slices of menma and had no additional flavor to it. It was very hard to eat and they gave me a pretty generous ration but I only eat half a slice. They were also generous with the side of corn but you cant really go wrong with corn lol. "
,,,,,"Their takoyaki was pretty expensive ($9), when most placed charge about $5-$7. When it came out, it was very beautiful and they added chopped, boiled egg underneath it. It was actually delicious! I've never tried it with egg before but I was pleasantly surprised."
,,,,,"All-in-all, service was pretty good at the bar and the food didn't take long to come out. I wouldnt mind recommending this place to other people for sure."

,,,,,I was staying at the HIE downtown for a business trip and wanted something outside the realm of American food for a change and this hit the spot!!!! I had the Tonkotsu Black ramen for my meal and a JINYA bun for an appetizer. The music was a little too loud for my taste but the service and food made up for it. Facility was clean and safe.
,,,,,"Service is trash here, at least it's open late but crappy servers, always have an attitude. It's always this location"

,,,,,I ordered the takoyaki and the JINYA Tonkotsu black that came highly recommended by my server. 
,,,,,Here's my breakdown: 
,,,,,Takoyaki: it wasn't good but it was edible. Each ball had two tiny pieces of octopus and a lot of bread filling. I didn't like it. 
,,,,,JINYA Tonkotsu black: it was good but missing flavor. The best part about the ramen was the seasoned egg. 
,,,,,"Overall, i think it's overhyped."

Never had pork belly that wasn't seared and hardly any meat, maybe that's their style but it was so mushy and fatty. Would recommend requesting them to sear it if possible! Also the pork belly bun bao, same thing. I personally don't like huge chunks of uncooked fat, my only complaint! Everything else was great!"

,,,,,"Went here on a a whim with coworkers during a work trip. The lychee mojito was very good, we all kept guzzling them down . For appetizers, we ordered the fried brussel sprouts and the edamame.

,,,,,"I ordered the spicy creamy vegan ramen with an egg, as I'm not actually vegan and love eggs in my ramen. However, the egg came in a hard boiled style, with the yolk mostly cooked through and not runny as I like it. Wouldn't recommend, but that's just me."
,,,,,"The broth was amazing, and everything I could have wanted out of ramen broth. However, the spicy description sadly did not come to be, as the soup was not at all spicy, but I could have added hot sauce if I wanted to, so I suppose I can't be too annoyed."
,,,,,"The noodles were cooked to my favorite al dente consistency, and they were flavorful and chewy. The tofu was also perfectly cooked, and were of the style that I prefer, being not-fried as they usually are when I get tofu in soup. The veggies were all cooked well, in that I didn't notice anything terrible about them in particular while consuming the dish. Honestly I didn't pay much attention, as the stars of the show were definitely the broth and the noodles, as should be the case with ramen."
,,,,,"Overall, a decent price for a pretty great bowl of ramen. The egg was a disappointment, but the ramen itself certainly was not!"
,,,,,I love ramen and I'm glad there is one closer to us on this side of I-10 now. I've been here twice and the food has been delicious every time. The only thing I have never loved about Jinya are the noodles. They're good but they're not great. And when you order add ons for your ramen you get enough for four people which is great If you have four people but I've never been with that many people. Good spot and good food. Fast service.

,,,,,"First off, I just wanna say that Jinya was one of my favorite Ramen restaurants. I didn't mind driving all the way down to midtown just to get some. All of my experiences have been good -- up until now. "
,,,,,"I came here on 03/23/18 at around 11:20 pm. The wait was approximately 40 minutes (we saw people waiting outside while we were walking up, we expected it). However, it didn't matter because I loved Jinya. "
,,,,,"We ordered the pork gyoza appetizer & it was great. I highly recommend y'all try it. We decided to try something different so we got the Spicy Chicken ramen (somewhere along those lines) with medium level spice. The food was great & we even took on the extra noodles deal. We really enjoyed our experience there -- up until we found a hair at the very bottom of the bowl. We weren't looking for a refund since we did finish the bowl. We just expected more quality out of what we paid/waited for. We told our waitress and she quickly apologized & informed us that she will speak to the manager. We received no refund or discount (but it's okay). We're not mad at her (since it's obviously not her fault), but we just wanted for them to make sure strands of hair doesn't get into anybody else's food. "
,,,,,Check your food for hair before you eat it.
,,,,,"Hi Vickie - Thank you for your review. We greatly appreciate your constructive feedback. I'm glad you enjoyed our ramen, but I regret that a hair strand managed to find its way into your bowl. I wish that hadn't happened."
,,,,,"All of our ramen chefs are required to wear health-code sanctioned caps, and our prep staff also wear hairnets. Our servers are also required to keep their hair pulled back, as well. As you mentioned at the top of our review, we are a high-volume restaurant. We serve several hundred bowls of ramen for lunch and dinner. We try as hard as humanly possible to make sure every bowl comes out correct and made-to-order. And if we ever make a mistake -- or if a hair ever ends up in the bowl -- we are happy to remake the dish, offer an alternative, or take the item off your tab. Our essential goal is for every customer to leave our house satisfied and happy."
,,,,,"I appreciate very much your bringing this matter to our attention. I will speak with our staff to see if and where a breakdown in protocol may have occurred. I hope this will not preclude future visits. And if you do come through again, please ask for a manager to ensure your visit is a positive one. Thank you again."

,,,,,They have ramen in Houston?????
,,,,,Recently took a week long trip to houston for work and was pleasantly surprised by the asian food scene they had in the area. What surprised me in particular is that in the heart of houston of all places I would find one of the best ramen broths I have had in a long time. 
,,,,,The black tonkotsu with fresh garlic on the side had these thick noodles and succulent broth that left me wanting more. The soup base was a little fatty so if that isnt your thing check out their chicken ramen instead which I heard from my coworker was incredible as well. They have a heaping amount of toppings like ginger and bamboo shoots but what impressed me was how tender the chasu pork was. The only bummer was that they're only a few pieces of meat.  
,,,,,The chicken wings here were kind of a bust and crazy small though... Just stick to the ramen when coming to JINYA! 
,,,,,Pro tip: Be sure to ask for an extra egg too. The flavored eggs here are awesome.
,,,,,"First time at this gem in midtown. Ordered the Tonkotsu Spicy Ramen (pork dish) and it was delicious. Comes with sprouts and spinach and spicy broth.. mannnn. My only issue is it only comes with two smedium pieces of perfectly cooked, tender, finger licking pork slices. If you REALLY want to enjoy your meal, I'd recommend ordering extra meat with any of the ramen bowls bc my friends spicy chicken ramen came with the same amount. If you're a ramen eater, pull up. You won't regret it. Also, my wife and friend seemed to enjoy their drinks.. I'm not drinking at the moment so I can't share whether they're personally delectable or not, but the ramen alone should be your reason to go. Hope this yelps!"

,,,,,Jinya Ramen was a great first experience. We had the Crispy Chicken and the Mini Tacos. The crispy chicken was great but we needed something other than soy sauce to dip the tenders. The Mini Tacos were super crunchy and delicious. 
,,,,,"I had the Tonkostu Black Ramen and it was good, but definitely needed some extra spice. I had to add some more soy sauce to give it more flavor. My fiancé had the chicken ramen and he enjoyed his a lot. The really cool thing about this place is you can customize your ramen or add any additional ingredients. "

,,,,,"I'm glad to see this place still operating during the pandemic, but as long as the pandemic is taking place, they've lost my business. "
,,,,,"First, seating availability is far too close for comfort to be a preventative measure for germ spreading. There wasn't any indication that some seats would be left unavailable for the purpose of distancing people. Also, from the looks of it, there wasn't anyone actively wiping down the surface of the tables between guests. "
,,,,,"Second, our server was not initially wearing a mask, and proceeded to wear it only over her mouth and not her nose. This shows either lack of understanding of the situation or respect to customers. Neither case is acceptable. "
,,,,,"Third, the music really should be turned down so that guests don't have to yell for the others in their party to hear them. This is usually fine, but not for mitigating germ spreading. "
,,,,,"Their food was ok. Tonkatsu black was good, my wife wasn't a fan of the slurp up cilantro ramen, and the salmon tacos are definitely not worth the price. "
,,,,,"I've been here several times before and have very much loved their food. My grievances come from the fact that I've experienced other restaurants during the pandemic and have been satisfied with the extent of their preventative measures. It is not something that is impossible to ask of a restaurant. It's not about how thorough they can be in regards to cleanliness, but instead how much are they willing to respect the health, safety, and impression of their customers."
,,,,,"Came here with a friend on a Friday night. It wasn't too crowded when we got there (6:00pm), but there was a moderate wait when we left (around 6:45). It can be hard if you have a party of more than 2, since they don't do reservations."
,,,,,"The ramen wasn't the best I've had but it was pretty solid! We got the Sprouting Up and the Spicy Chicken ramen. The broth was creamy & rich, and both their thin and thick noodles taste great. (They also refill your noodles for $2.00 if you're a big noodle eater.)"
,,,,,"If you're looking for a date spot or dinner with a SMALL group, Jinya is a good option. I'll definitely be back!"

,,,,,As much as I love this place. The wait time can get ridiculous when you have a party of more than 2 people.
,,,,,"They don't do reservations and everyone in your party needs to be at the restaurant before you can get seated. Last time I came here, I came with three other people. The host at the front said it would be about 20-30 minutes. In the end we waited a whole hour plus before we complained and we were finally seated. Their seating system isn't the best"
,,,,,Other than that the ramen is great. I usually get the JINYA Tonkotsu Black. I love the garlic chips in it and the broth is delicious. 
,,,,,I'll come back but probably not on a Saturday during rush hour.
,,,,,"Hi Natasha - Thank you for your excellent review. We appreciate your recommendations and your business.

,,,,,"Bumping it up to a shiny 5-star. After coming here a few times at both locations, it has become my favorite ramen place in town. Parking is limited in the area, but there is a garage parking around the corner. Expect a wait if you come during their peak time. If you don't want to wait then come on a weekday around the afternoon. On weekends especially for dinner, the wait is about 15-30min. "
,,,,,"My favorite ramen is the Jinya Black tonkotsu. You can choose your level of mild, spicy, or hot. Portion is good. I like the thin ramen noodles they use with a whole egg. Broth is always creamy and flavored just right. I chose spicy and it was a good amount of spiciness. Their hot level isn't too spicy either. "
,,,,,"If you want something lighter than their sprouting up ramen is a good choice. Plenty of brussels sprouts in your ramen. Some appetizers that good are the tempura brussel sprouts, taiyaki, and their mini salmon poke taco. However, I would skip the salmon sashimi. It had a mushy taste. "
,,,,,"Staff is always friendly. Services were fast. Ramen was brought out quickly despite the place was packed. They have booth seats, bar seats, and community tables. The interiors were trendy with low lightings. Their happy hour is 3pm-5pm. Overall, definitely one of the best ramen place in town."

,,,,,The best time to come without waiting in line is on a weekday around the afternoon. I always hear everyone rave about this place but the wait time is quite long. 
,,,,,I came on a Wednesday around 4pm and the place was quite empty. Parking in the garage was also easy to find and a small walk to the restaurant. We were greeted as we walked in and seated right away.
,,,,,The atmosphere is cozy. It not as spacious as I thought it would be but they do have many booths and bars. Lighting is a bit dark. They do have happy hour from 3p-5p and the happy hour menu is on the table. 
,,,,,Jinya Tonkotsu black: Nice flavor. Good portion but I was hoping it to be a bit bigger. The broth was a bit salty for my taste but the noodles were fresh. The egg was a full egg that was cooked just right. The meat was also tender just the way I like it. 
,,,,,Salmon poke taco: This was from the happy hour menu. Comes with two small tacos. The shells were crunchy and the salmon was fresh. Good flavors and a good choice for appetizers. 
,,,,,Takoyaki: Comes with six takoyakis. Nice presentations. Probably the nicest of all the takoyakis I have eaten. There seems to be some sort of scrambled eggs underneath the takoyakis. Something that I have never seen before. 
,,,,,"Overall, a good first experience here. Services were friendly and welcoming. I hope to come back again but hopefully avoiding the wait."

Wait times have always been reasonable for a place so popular, and their late night hours and delivery make it a great ramen option at any time of the day. Solid ramen, with a good assortment if side dishes, great atmosphere and wait staff, and the late night hours make JINYA my go to ramen in mid-town."

They have some ramen creations you can order or create your own for a charge per topping. The flavor was pretty good. Service was okay. They all shouted some word (every time someone came in?) and sitting at the ramen bar it was loud and obnoxious."

,,,,,"We were coming from a Houston rockets game and everything was closed except Jinya. Being from New York, ramen is something we were really familiar with and have high standards on. The place was pretty busy and smelled amazing. We had the Spicy Chicken ramen, kings tonkotsu black, and the octopus balls. The ramen was solid, nothing mind boggling but definitely tasty. The octopus balls I would definitely pass on next time."
,,,,,We ended our meal with some tasty green tea mochi.

,,,,,"Look I know. It's called JINYA ""RAMEN"" Bar, but on this day I just wasn't feeling ramen for dinner"
,,,,,"Now I started with the crispy chicken (during happy hour, 3pm-5pm daily, only $4) and if you know, you know. It's that good. "
,,,,,"Since I wasn't feeling Ramen, I had to venture out. I went with the California Poke Bowl - Regular size. Honestly, it blew my mind. It was super tasty and yummy. All the ingredients tasted fresh. Only downside is I totally could of just gotten the small because the regular was way too big. On the plus side, next time in my wife and I will just share the regular because it's perfect for two. "
,,,,,"Afterwards, the waiter told me the poke bowl was one of the least popular menu items. I was flabbergasted. With something that good on the menu, it has to be more highly regarded. "
,,,,,Service is always good btw. Came in at 4pm on a Saturday and it was perfect.

,,,,,"My boyfriend and I visited Houston, and we missed Jinya ramen. We went there a few days ago and got seated right away. We were surprised by how close each table was to each other. Jinya does not follow the Covid Guidelines. We understand that the Covid affects a lot of business, and business is eager to make some profit to survive. However, putting all the tables so close to each other is putting all of the customers at risk. It made us feel very comfortable. I hope the management reads this review and makes some changes to their Covid Guidelines to keep all of their customers safe."
,,,,,"Wife had the karaage chicken ramen. Dashi was flavorful and didn't have a strong overpowering chicken flavor.  Thin cut noodles were soft and tasty. I got the Jinya tonkotsu black ramen. Thicker noodles, 2 slabs of belly pork in pork dashi. Was very delicious. "
,,,,,Love decor.

,,,,,The food they serve at Jinya is phenomenal.  The broth for their tonkatsu is cooked to perfection and you can tell that it requires overnight prep.  The eggs are still runny on inside which is an awesome boost to the flavor.  The Tonkatsu itself melts in your mouth.  And the ramen noodles leave you begging for more.  My favorite is the Jinya Black; it has roasted garlic and wonderful flavor.  Make sure to order it Hot!
,,,,,"Service at Jinya is always top notch.  The resturant itself isn't the largest venue, and servers make up for it with large crowds by being efficient and polite."
,,,,,"I really love the feel of the resturant, it has a bar up front, a community table and booths in the back.  Especially at peak times, be prepared to make friends at the community table!"
,,,,,"They have a pretty good selection of imports, when it comes to drinks.  I'll be honest, I haven't spent much time delving into the drinks due to the great food!"

,,,,,"This is definitely my favorite spot to get ramen in Houston. It's probably the best ramen I've ever had. I always get the Spicy Chicken Ramen and it never disappoints. The ramen usually comes out very hot, which I like (I've been to a place where it was warm and I wasn't happy lol). I usually add Chicken Soboro (ground chicken) to my ramen and it gives it more flavor. The flavor of the chicken broth is great, and the level of spicy isn't unbearable (I usually like mine really spicy so I always add extra hot sauce). The chicken is always tender and succulent, and they give you a nice amount. "

I can't recall what I got the first time, but last night I got a to go order of JINYA Tonkotsu Black with thick noodles and a side of fresh garlic, and I think it's safe to say it was the best ramen I've ever had. The pork belly melts in your mouth and the broth is so rich. The extra garlic is what set it over the top. "
,,,,,"It was a Saturday night, and boy am I glad I got my order to go. It was absolutely packed. It took 20 min for my order to be ready, what they quoted, and my order was accurate. With tax it came out to be $14-something. Will definitely be back soon."

,,,,,"I went with a sukiyaki beef ramen.  It was delicious.  There was plenty of beef and flavor in the pot.  You can customize your level of spiciness.  I went with the spiciest version.  Enjoyed all the scallions, noodles that were bursting in the ramen. I also tried the vegan ramen and it had plenty of flavor too but no meat.  I love my beef in the ramen.  We also ordered the spicy ginger and the jinya black tonkotsu.  My fellow yelpies enjoyed their ramen."
,,,,,"They have a nice interior/ambiance with low lighting.  They have booth, bar and communal seating available."
,,,,,"Staff was friendly and efficient, hence service was up to standards.  I will be visiting Jinya soon, probably some time this week.  We did have issues finding parking.  There was none available on the street, so we went to this lot around the corner.  I believe it was valet only but I could be wrong."

Not a problem, except when they seated us, the table that we were going to take up was still occupied by people. We awkwardly waited a bit for the waitress to take us back to the crowded front. Other than this, the service was good and my water cup was always filled. For appetizers, we got the shrimp tempura that was coated in a creamy sauce (delicious) and the crispy chicken bites (super hot right when you get it. So watch out!). I preferred the shrimp since it tasted more flavorful! But both are good! The ramen type I always get is the tonkotsu black. VERY flavorful and with the seasoned egg it truly hits the spot any day! Definitely give this place a try if you've never had ramen and want to!"

,,,,,"Restaurant, great looking place, nice quick service, everyone was really helpful and is somewhere i will come again when I am in town."
,,,,,"Overall the food flavor is good, quite good, just not quite the punch I am looking for in Ramen though.I felt like the depth just wasn't quite there.  I like a deeply rich broth, opaque, cloudy, collagen bubbles on the surface just a deeply tasty tonkatsu and this wasn't quite it.  Still really good.  What killed it for me were the noodles, they just didn't have enough substance.  They were far too thin.  I do like that you can get a refill on the noodles if you want, that's great."
,,,,,"Overall for Houston ramen, it's probably a 4+, if it's your only Ramen experience, it is great."

She acts like everything is so hard and stressful. She puts her own emotions off on the guests and it's extremely rude . It absolutely killed my vibe and experience . Furthermore,  the restaurant has a spicy umami ramen they advertise as spicy that's not even spicy . They charge you more for it to be spicy when in the advertisement it's already branded as spicy . This is very misleading to the guests . My last experience was horrible . I will not be retuning . Don't call something spicy and have it included price then charge guest an additional price for spice ."

We appreciate the feedback, though, and we have taken this opportunity to discuss this with our staff member in question.

However, as a franchise concept we are not allowed to change the names of our dishes that have been decided upon by our corporate headquarters. Also, regarding the up charge to make it spicy, this has been a longstanding policy for all of our ramen bowls, except for the Spicy Chicken Ramen and the Tonkotsu Spicy. These are the only two ramen bowls that require guests to choose Mild, Spicy or Hot, before submitting their order."

I will say that I find them a little over priced I believe I paid about $16-17. Although I love their food I wouldn't spend that much often for ramen. But hey, given their location, I'm sure they have to price up. It's on the outskirts of downtown. Would recommend to try!"

,,,,,I needed something light before I started off to work today. Walked right and saw at the bar open seats and the Texans and Giants game on... Almost Perfect...-Steelers Play Monday Night. 
,,,,,I ordered my gyoza and when it arrived -No mixing cup for sauces. After asking for one (granted 5 people at the bar- 2 behind the bar) I then had to find the sauces. 
,,,,,"The Gyoza were perfect especially with my special sauce concoction. The spicy chicken ramen I ordered was great as usual; however, it did seem like the bowl was filled to the usual levels from the past. "
,,,,,The team of staff I encountered were good but not as attentive to details as I've seen on prior visits. Too much hanging out with each other.
,,,,,The manager reached out to me after my last visit and told me to come back anytime- so I did -an hour before closing. 
,,,,,Stopped in late tonight because I needed something good and lite to carry me over tonight. I also wanted to give them another chance because my last visit... well that's in the past let's see what tonight holds. 
,,,,,We ordered our Gyoza first so that we enjoy it before our meal. Well the Gyoza came out but they didn't leave any condiments cup to mix up your sauces for the Gyoza. We finally got them and Gyoza was still hot and good. We probably should ordered another serving.  
,,,,,"The Spicy Chicken Ramen was the Capital B.O.M.B!!! The spices tantalized my lips and taste buds. Totally satisfied with my meal. My server was very good, he took care of all our needs."
,,,,,Craving some ramen and had to make the stop. Wow I forgot how crowded it gets on Friday nights . We arrived at 9:09p but it looks like they are getting people in and out.  The hostess is telling everyone 35 minutes she may know her stuff because now it's 9:24p.
,,,,,With the wait I had to get to the restroom. And I must say the guy in front of me was really exfoliating his inner self. The problem with him being in there so long is that the restroom really only serves one person. So I waited... To my surprise the restroom was very clean and free from anything foul in the air. 
,,,,,We sat down 9:35 and by 9:40 we had our drinks and order turned in..
,,,,,"A very lively crowd tonight- which is good, the music is upbeat for staff and eating habits of the patrons. Nice get them in get them out. I am always amazed they have a small kitchen but the get the food out."
,,,,,"Well they did it again forgot our appetizers. My spicy chicken was great, very  Flavorable. All three of our meals were great and I planned to purchase 2 orders to-go but I was so AGAIN DISAPPOINTED about my appetizer and not getting them. "
,,,,,The manager did apologize and take 30% off our order but I wanted my wings. I guess you can't have it all...

,,,,,"The Spicy Chicken Ramen was the Capital B.O.M.B!!! The spices tantalized my lips and taste buds. Totally satisfied with my meal. My server -Martin- was very good, he took care of all our needs."
,,,,,Showed up today expecting to doing some chowing down but Contruction around this area is terrible. 
,,,,,"Walked in and sat immediately down which was cool; however, it was a real strange smell-like sewer. We stayed anyway-probably shouldn't have.  We ordered Gyoza as an appetizer and then our main course Spicy Chicken Ramen. It took a longer time time than usual for us to get them. Well we couldn't enjoy the Gyoza because it came out 30 seconds before our main dishes. So went sent them back. I wouldn't have been so ticked but the resturant was not even half full and the majority of associates were in the back or standing by the kitchen bar in a place where they were hidden from the customers view -some on their phones. "
,,,,,"Something has definitely changed here since my last visit- Slow kitchen service, sewer smell resturant and Club Music--- Really? "
,,,,,My Spicy Ramen makes this a 2 Star visit
,,,,,"I invited and met my friend at Jinya today,  She said that she has only been here once and that was for her birthday. Asked her did she like it and she was like yes."
,,,,,Well I suggested the Pork gyoza. And she loved it. She separated each one for me to know how many I have and not to eat more than my share. The gyoza was like always nicely seasoned and great tasting for the palate. (FYI I did make a nice dipping sauce) 
,,,,,I can't remember what she ordered but it looked so good. And the smell of the garlic hovered above the dish. She ate it all.
,,,,,I had my spicy chicken with broccoli and chicken sobora (spicy ground chicken) All I can say is that it got the spot. 
,,,,,Thank you Jinya for always having providing consistent and great tasting food. 
,,,,,The service was great. (From the front do to the server.  A +
,,,,,With my second mother who helped raise me. No line today and sat right down. Service thus far is great. We had 6 in our party and the entries came out as fast as the appetizers. 
,,,,,I had the spicy chicken Wirh Sobora (ground spicy chicken) and broccoli.  I must say this today was a perfect visit. 
,,,,,Last meal with my son before he leaves. 
,,,,,Thank you Jinya.  You guys rock!!
,,,,,Over an hour wait for our party. The place was packed but my stomach is empty. I felt that the servers forgot us. Because it was even mentioned by one one of the that they apologize because we had been waiting over an hour. It might have been that our buzzer wasn't even activated by the way were called to be seated. 
,,,,,We stayed because this place is not only good but also my son who is in the Navy wanted to eat there before he had to ship ou
,,,,,The ambiance is perfect for getting to know who you are with. My kids. 
,,,,,I  had the wonton chicken (make it spicy) added some broccoli and shredded spicy chicken it it just right. 
,,,,,By far the happening spot.... on that block 
,,,,,This spot would've gotten a 5 but I believe there was some type of mess up when it came to seating and the girls at the front just giggled. No manager was informed. I guess it was a joke to them. The food and service at the table moved the needle up to a 3.
,,,,,The ambiance was perfect. The location is by so many other fresh and lively spots. If you like Pho- you will love the Ramen noodles. It's. not about the noodles it's about the broth.
,,,,,I  had the spicy chicken (which is the 2nd popular meal) and it was great. I added fresh cabbage which made it that much more appetizing.

,,,,,"Not gonna lie, when it comes to ramen, I am ridiculously picky. I can count on one hand the number of ramen shops (outside of Japan itself) I think are worth frequenting, so I was very pleasantly surprised by JINYA. It's quickly become my favorite ramen spot in Houston. "
,,,,,"Hubby and I first came around 5pm on a Tuesday and were seated immediately. The layout comprises a row on the left of 2-person booths, two large tables in the middle, and some 4-6 seater tables along the wall on the right. There's also a bar up in front for drinks (and maybe food?) as well as a bar in the back where you can watch them make the food! There's a happy hour menu during the early dinner hours, and we ended up getting the JINYA Bun (pretty tasty, although tbh I probably wouldn't pay full price for it). We also opted for the takoyaki, which I would highly recommend. Most places end up dousing the balls in WAY TOO MUCH sauce, but JINYA decorates the sauce at the bottom of the plate and puts the takoyaki balls on top so that you can decide how much sauce you really want to use. "
,,,,,"As for the ramen, our go-to option is the JINYA tonkotsu black. Very flavorful and delicious, and the noodles are cooked to perfection! I always want to try some of the other options, but this one is just so tasty that I inevitably end up coming back to it. Only complaint is that the ramen is a bit oily. After you're done eating, if you still have soup left, you can see the layer of oil forming at the top. Not as bad as some other places, but I would prefer if they used maybe just half the amount of oil. "
,,,,,Parking has never been an issue for me. There's the parking garage behind the restaurant that's always had spots when I go.
,,,,,"Hi Ying - Thank you for your great review. We appreciate your thorough assessment as this type of feedback is invaluable to us. For future reference, you can always ask your server for ""Less Oil"" in your ramen, which is a common request.

,,,,,I am not a big fan of tonkatsu ramen but man the black one was pretty good! Not salty at all and just the exact amount of creamy! I also really enjoyed the shoyu ramen and loved the hot sauce they had on the table to add to it.
,,,,,It was so good I ended up devouring it so quickly. It was so little noodles tho so it was a little disappointing cause the price is pretty high! However it was in the middle of what looked like downtown so I can understand the high price tag. 
,,,,,The environment was super busy but unique and pretty too! And everyone was so nice and helpful. I would definitely reccomend to come at least once and check it out!

,,,,,There are a few new items on the menu so I tried it on my last visit. The cilantro ramen reminds me a lot of the Thai Tom yum soup with the mushrooms and the broth. It doesn't really taste anything like Japanese ramen so I'm assuming it's a Thai inspired bowl. 
,,,,,There is way too much cilantro in the bowl in my opinion but it is good!

,,,,,Went in for lunch today for my first try. 
,,,,,Upon walking in I was greeted by the host and chose to sit at the bar; after all this is a ramen bar! 
,,,,,"For my dish I opted for the chef special mazemen which comes with bokchoy, bell peppers and ground pork. I substituted the ground pork for ground chicken, added a poached egg and nori (seaweed). "
,,,,,The mazemen was flavor packed and delicious.
,,,,,Unfortunately I let my yelping get the best of me so my food was lukewarm by the time I was actually able to enjoy it because I was busy taking photos and making observations for my review  oh well! 
,,,,,It was still yummy and that's what matters. 
,,,,,"To end, I opted for the green tea Mochi ice cream which was divine. The matcha consistency was on par and the jelly like shell creates a perfect contrast with the creamy core."
,,,,,"In terms of service, the bar tender was spectacular. My water was always filled and she did it all while giving me my space and peace to enjoy my dish.  "
,,,,,"The decor is nice as well, at least from where I sat. Will have to return to try more of the menu items!"
,,,,,"Always have a fun and great experience here. The staff is always friendly. The pork buns are really good and better than others I've had before. The dumplings are also very good and usually I have to order more! I get the sprouting up spicy ramen, I love the spice and the crispy Brussel sprouts! I also change my noodles to the spinach ones which I also love! Their drinks are fun and in my opinion strong but I did really enjoy the lychee martini."
,,,,,"Hi Ivonne - Thank you for your great review. We appreciate your kind words, and we're glad you enjoyed our fare. We no longer carry spinach noodles, but we do have kale noodles. Please come back soon!"

,,,,,The best ramen in Town ! This is one of our fav ramen place in H-town! You must try !
,,,,,"After living in Japan for three years, it will be hard to impressed me with ramen that is from a US location. We order the goyza first, i was more impress that it was homemade instead of frozen. It was tasty and filling. When the ramen came out, it was a large portion. Pork was so tender and most importantly the egg was near orange and the yolk was running. It is as close to a ramen shop in Japan."
,,,,,This was my first time here & apparently they revamped their menu with a whole bunch of vegan options!! I love love love bao buns & it was very hard for me to find a veggie/vegan one. This one is a vegan bbq one made with beyond meat. It was so bomb. 
,,,,,II also got the spicy ramen & it was fiiiiiireeee. 
,,,,,The pricing was good- we paid 40 for two ramens & the bun +tip.
,,,,,They have so many vegan options to choose from! 
,,,,,"The ambiance was low key & intimate. They're open pretty late, I i went around 12am and it was still  packed "

,,,,,"I feel like the ramen is a pretty pricey and the noodles texture taste a bit off to me, and the broth is just decent. You can definitely get the same/better quality ramen for a cheaper price at other locations, but I will go to jinyas for convenience. There are couple other shops nearby to go to after eating at this location too."

,,,,,The ramen is delicious and well-stocked with fillings that will make your stomach want another scoop. Good time
,,,,,"was working in the area and decided to stop here for lunch. for $20 and no drink, i expected something a little more.. filling.. great flavor. Presentation was gorgeous. I told the waitress i wanted something spicy. She recommended the tonkotsu black. And added spice. Didnt know i was gonna get charged extra for a line of spice.. and it wasnt spicy at all... i may try this place a few more times before considering it a ""no"""

,,,,,Their ramen is delicious. I always get mine with thick noodles and egg.
,,,,,Certain appetizers are hit or miss.
,,,,,"Jinya Ramen Bar is always a solid choice for lunch or dinner. Ramen to me is a true asian comfort food, and really warms your soul when you need a pick me up. This particular Jinya is by far the most crowded/popular in Houston so expect a wait at almost all parts of the day."
,,,,,"Once you patiently wait through the line to be seated, their ramen is worth it. Or if you're lucky, the bar is open seating and first come/first serve, and does offer the full menu to eat. I generally switch between ordering their tonkatsu black or their spicy umami miso ramen. The tonkatsu black is good if you want a strong flavored pork broth with chashu and an egg without being spicy. But the spicy umami miso ramen is good if you like the richness of miso with the kick of spice. You can ask for their spice level to be mild, medium, hot, or if you're a hot head like me, I ask for it to be double inferno level spice. No matter what you order though, I'm sure you'll be pleased. The service is great at this location as well."
,,,,,"The only other problem here can be parking at times. There is a parking garage, but its shared by multiple other nearby businesses. Parking can be a struggle on busy nights in midtown on Friday and Saturday nights."

If you're in the mood for ramen, JINYA consistently brings forth an incredible selection. I've only eaten the vegetarian options and they are great! Surprisingly, the two vegan options (yes 2), are better than the vegetarian option. The broth is creamy and the noodles are thick and flavorful. With endless add-ons, you can have a slightly different experience each time you come here. "

The Chorizo style ""spicy chicken soboro"" was a great recommendation and really took this ramen bowl out of this world. This has got to be on your Houston must try ramen list!"

,,,,,"I went to Jinya to try the ramen as it is one of the most raved about in Houston. The atmosphere was pleasant and nice! I got the takoyaki balls as an appetizer and it was delicious! There were so many flavors in it. However, I came there for the main course (ramen). So I ordered the tonkotsu spicy ramen and have a before and after before I added my additional items. I ordered cabbage, corn, and chicken dumplings. The extra items were very expensive. When I tasted the ramen I was disappointed! The ramen was gross! The noodles were chewy and hard as if they hadn't been throughly cooked and spicy was not... spicy. There was an extreme lack of flavor. This place is overhyped because of the location.  I honestly would rather cook myself maruchan noodles. Unfortunately I will not be returning... not even for the yummy takoyaki."

,,,,,"Whenever I ask people where the best ramen in Houston is, I often hear them say Jinya. These people are onto something. Jinya is a pretty bomb place to get ramen, and the long waits during dinner times is a good indicator of that. "
,,,,,"So, to bypass the wait, my friend and I took advantage of our erratic graduate student schedules and got a late (2p-ish) lunch last Friday. We waited ~10 minutes to get a seat, and the place was pretty packed regardless of the weird time! "
,,,,,"After we were seated we were helped very quickly. Our food came out quickly, our server was super prompt (he asked us how the food was tasting...before either of us had a chance to take a bite) and friendly. "
,,,,,"I ordered one of the new items from their menu, the Tangy Shrimp Cilantro, which had a thick and savory broth, thin noodles, fried shrimp, and topped with a generous amount of cilantro. I added on an egg because...if I'm going to a ramen place part of my judgement of whether it's a good ramen place is if their runny egg is good. (At Jinya, it so was btw.) Definitely an unconventional ramen choice but so so good. "

,,,,,"Put in my order and to start, I went with the salmon poke tacos, pork gyoza, and the mixed greens salad.  "
,,,,,"For the tacos, you get two of these small wonton shells filled with salmon poke and cilantro.  The shells were super crispy and really added to the texture.  The first shell exploded into wonton shrapnel after I bit into it.  Delicious."
,,,,,"The pork gyoza were packed with intense flavor.  The salad was one of those mixed green variety with that orange, citrusy, peanuty dressing.  Not bad."
,,,,,"For the main entree, I ordered the tangy cilantro shrimp ramen bowl.  A large bowl of red broth and thin noodles topped with a mound of cilantro.  Me likey cilantro.  Just beneath the surface of the broth were the four tempura shrimp.  Flavorful.  Tempura coating was obviously a little soggy but expected due to the circumstances.  The broth was a pork/shrimp mix.  It was spicy as hell and must have contained what I believe to be some sort of chili powder.  Great bowl of soup.  Would eat again many times."

,,,,,My go to ramen spot and my go to order: spicy chicken ramen (inferno!!!) with an egg and fresh garlic. SLURPPPP! I think I really got into ramen after Jinya because I like realized I like lighter flavors aka chicken rather than more classic flavors like miso/pork. I also like their seaweed salad and totally need to try more of the apps because they have some awesome looking stuff. 
,,,,,I usually can get in at jinya pretty quick (party of 2) even when it's busy because they have a community table which I think is totally great for busy places. 
,,,,,"This location is always clean, service is prompt and polite, and consistently tasty!! No complaints here."
,,,,,"This is a delicious spot for ramen. The spicy ramen is definitely spicy, so be careful of that! The ramen bowl is so flavorful and you really can't go wrong with what you order here. They have a good list of wines, beers, and sakes. Ramen hack, if you have lots of broth left over but need more noodles you can order extra for only $2.50 or so. Makes the rest of your bowl go farther! I also love the pork chashu bowl on the side. It could even be an entree in and of itself. The pork is salty, well marinated and so tasty. It's served over rice with green onion and a delicious soft boiled egg. This is our go to ramen spot and usually the wait time is a little shorter than they estimate. But do be warned that on the weekend nights the wait can get long--which is a good sign!"

,,,,,"Hello Richard - Thank you for your review. We regret that you had a negative experience at our restaurant. However, we believe our pricing is competitive given our location in Midtown and the quality of product that we produce and serve."
,,,,,"In addition, JINYA is a nationwide-franchise concept that has specific aesthetic and operational standards we must follow. Moreover, since the beginning of this year, the food-service and hospitality industry has been facing supply-chain issues affecting not only our ability to source specialty-imported food items, but also nearly every aspect of our operations from wine and liquor to cleaning supplies. This, unfortunately, has helped to drive prices higher in nearly every category of our business."
,,,,,"In regards to your point about ""chili paste,"" this is an item that is and has always been listed on our menu as a side topping; however, its official name is ""Spicy Sauce."" Over the years, customers have called it ""chili paste,"" often confusing it with our ""Hot Sauce,"" which is available for free. In particular, our ""Spicy Sauce"" is a proprietary sauce that comprises more than a dozen ingredients."
,,,,,"All of these factors must be taken into consideration when pricing our offerings and also when instituting company-wide policies. Without consistency, our franchise model would not operate at maximum efficiency; moreover, we would fail to comply with our corporate guidelines."

,,,,,I had never eaten ramen (other than top ramens during my college days) prior to coming to Jinya. I was pleased to see they vegan and vegetarian options on the menu. They specifically had two vegan ramen options so I went with the spicy vegan ramen. Tasted similar to chicken soup broth. Very flavorful. Loved the soba noodles. I ordered extra so soak up more of the broth. The tofu was excellent too. Took on the flavor of the broth. I've have since came back twice and cannot wait to go back again.

,,,,,I was in midtown and got takeout on a whim.
,,,,,"Chicken ramen - 4/5 - Exactly as pictured in the menu. Broth was tasty, though oily. Noodles were a nice dense and chewy texture. Nothing spectacular but just what I expected."
,,,,,"Pork chashu bowl - 3/5 - Decent taste, poor value. I love this dish, so I was disappointed by the tiny pieces of chashu (nothing like the chunks in the menu) that might've filled a shot glass. For the same price, I could get a regular size bowl with 5x the amount of pork elsewhere."
,,,,,"I remember liking this place more when it first opened. Since then, I've tried most ramen shops in town and I don't know if I'll return here."

,,,,,"While the food here was great I only gave 2 stars because there was no limited capacity during the pandemic.  No empty table between seated tables to create that ""buffer"". It was almost shoulder to shoulder. The close proximity in which guests were seated made it feel as if there was no pandemic!"
,,,,,"Also, while being seated the hostess was spraying people's hands as they entered. One group declined the spray and the hostess was ok with that. At that moment my party should have turned around and left. Needlessly to say, we hurried through our meal at left as soon as we could. "
,,,,,"So great food, great service, but get it to go."
,,,,,"This is a great ramen bar! It's not NYC, Japanese underground ramen scene, but it is still very tasty. They have so many options, and something definitely for everyone. Their buns are a perfectly moist, without being soggy, even if you order take out. I would recommend to call in your order if you want to pick k up, as it comes out WAY cheaper. The staff is always friendly and they have saved me by bringing me towels and such as I got stuck in torrential Houston rain as I was walking there. I am definitely a fan, and will be back again."

The interior is dimly lit and has a cool, modern aesthetic, and the staff always yells something (tbh can never tell what they're saying lol) when a new party gets seated. Random but fun!"
,,,,,"I got the spicy tonkotsu ramen and loved every bite of it. The portion is decently big and they hit the perfect spice level. It doesn't come with an egg so I always ask for one on top. They also have some extra sauces available at your table - adding the chili oil to your ramen gives it a great kick! My friends and I also shared the gyoza appetizer. I personally thought it was just ok - not bad at all, but nothing special."
,,,,,"Hi Jessie - Thanks for the kind words and the excellent review. We are grateful to have clientele such as yourself, and we promise to keep working hard to earn your business."
,,,,,"Regarding our unified ""Irrashai!"" as each party is seated, please allow me to explain: The ""yelling"" is an integral part of our corporate culture here at JINYA. As a Japanese company that came to the U.S. more than 10 years ago, JINYA integrated many service customs that you will find in Japan today, namely, in almost every business, staff are trained to yell greetings (""Irrashai"") to show their enthusiasm and genki spirit. Genki (元気) is a common Japanese word that means ""energetic, lively and healthy."""

,,,,,"I've been to Jinya twice and both times was served by a heavy accent blonde lady. Both times was such a hard time explaining to her how I was requesting my order. When order came the first time, she saw that me ramen with ground chicken, when I had asked for grilled chicken. I mentioned to her I had ordered grilled, she then proceeded to come bring me a side dish wish grilled chicken. The way she duke weed was as she quickly passed by sliding it across the table, no hello, no ""here's your chicken"", just left it passing by, mind you this was a slow flow around 11 AM. Second time was a similar situation."

Now let's go into the food; I had the wonton chicken soup and let me tell you, this was the bomb! i loved it, usually when i came to jinya i always left unsatisfied without my choice in food , but this time i was satisfied."
,,,,,"I'm usually pretty suspicious when people say rave about good ramen.  I've had places that people say that the ramen is great and then come to find out that it was instant ramen.  Jinya really blew me away.  With great ramen, it really starts with the broth.  It is absolutely amazing, really thick and flavorful.  A lot of places will have watery broth but not this place.  I got the Tonkotsu Black and it was amazing.  The second item I look for is fresh noodles that are not under or over cooked.  Score here as well.  And the final item is the pork.  It was amazing.  I could have eaten that just by itself.  Wish they had one of these in Dallas.  Thank you Jinya!!!"

,,,,,I was looking for something different and different is absolutely what I got. 
,,,,,"The place looks small when you first walk in, but there is more dine-in seating behind the bar area. The waiters were prompt and attentive, which I appreciate. "
,,,,,"The mule was perfect, light, fruity, seltzer-y lol, definitely would order again. The fig-looking fruit on top was more of a decorative touch I suppose, because it didn't taste like a fig at all lololol. "
,,,,,"Anyway, for the main course. I got the spicy chicken ramen (hot), w cabbage on the side and it was delicious. I expected crinkly, or rice noodles, like what's used in pho, but I got a more solid, angel hair-like pasta in the bowl. The soup was filled w green onions, bean sprouts, kikurage (which had the consistency of chicken gristle) and two tender, thinly sliced chicken pieces. The broth was really thick and flavorful. This place did not disappoint. I will be back to try other items on their menu."

,,,,,"I used to love ordering take-out from Jinya! Their Tonkotsu ramen with the pork chashu was truly *chef's kiss*. The containers that also come with them are also perfect for takeout ramen and virtually mess free. However, this might have happened a few months ago, but for some reason they changed their pork chashu. They're now smaller pieces and the taste is just off...Last time I ate it it tasted like it was old or gone bad. It may not be the case, as they could have switched to a cheaper chashu. Nevertheless, I wish they could switch it back and maybe I'll order more often again!"
,,,,,"Hello Nancy - Thank you for your review. About a month ago, our corporate headquarters changed the pork chashu from its original recipe. As a franchise, we are legally required to follow strict recipe guidelines for the preparation and plating of our dishes."

,,,,,"We were just getting together with a group of friends for dinner, and Jinya was suggested and I had not been to this location ever and wanted to check it out. It was a Saturday night and social distancing seating. It was also very busy and we went at like 9 PM and it still had a 25 minute wait."
,,,,,"Wait Staff (2/5): The hostess on this night was an All Star! She was super nice to everyone that was waiting and to the people with pickup orders. She kept homeless beggars away from us, and stopped some tow truck from towing some vehicles that to go orders. She was flying everywhere and had a fun attitude about everything. She made the difference between the two vs three star."
,,,,,"Cannot say the same about our waiter, he was absolutely horrible, we saw him three times, initially to bring water, get our drink order and finally to take our order. He was never ever seen again! We had to stop random waiters to get help for certain things and to get our check at the end."
,,,,,"Drinks (5/5): We ordered a pitcher of Kirin Ichiban and it was $22, which was 1.25 pint for three people and is cheaper than buying individual beers. They are about $6-$8."
,,,,,"Food (4/5): The group ordered a bunch of items, and my friend next to me ordered Crispy Chicken Small Plate, he seemed to enjoy it, to me it was a tad dry, but its suppose to be fried crispy chicken."
,,,,,"I ordered the spicy chicken ramen with medium spice level and with the thick noodles. I asked for an extra order of noodles and was told it is already put in. Which is strange because at most locations they give it to you on the side, I got charged $2.50 for it and I am not even sure if received any extra noodles because it looked the same as everyone else's bowl. The broth tasted so good and it was perfectly spiced, I ordered some mushrooms and some corn as extras. I was able to finish about half and took the other half home in a nice container. I did not want to be full and it tasted really good the next day after heated up. I ordered a chicken bowl, there was only two slices of chicken in the entire bowl, so I do not really understand that at all."
,,,,,"Check (2/5): I did not come with much expectations because their service is atrocious at every location I have been too. I am not going to blame the waitress for trying to figure out everything for us at the end and she was super helpful, but our waiter royally screwed us and left. I hope our tip went to her and not him. We had a group of 4 and it was impossible for her to split it after the waiter said ""I will take care of it."" So we decided to get two checks and figure it out and they messed that up as well."

,,,,,This place was amazing! I have been looking for a good ramen spot in Houston since I moved back and kept leaving disappointed. 
,,,,,I ordered the Tonkotsu (pork) Spicy with added fresh garlic. I love my spicy foods so the bartender at the front who was serving me let me know that their is a spicier option called inferno that I could get for my ramen. I really appreciated that she told me that. 
,,,,,The ramen came out in a reasonable amount of time. Not too fast but not waiting forever either. I didn't like the noodles too much. They were okay but nothing special. That's why this review is 4/5 starts. What was amazing though was the broth. The broth was so delicious and just the right level of spicy! It saved the ramen for me. I loved the broth so much that I killed the whole bowl.  
,,,,,"I will definitely go back here. The atmosphere was great, the people were friendly, and the food was good. Next time I order the ramen I will try it with a different type of noodle and add some ground beef."

It just seems nuts that the vegetarian options are some of the most expensive ones (where we don't even get the meat-- which typically is the most expensive option at places!) "

,,,,,"We came for dinner after finding this place on YELP! Everything was great! Super busy though!! I ordered a Mojito while waiting for a table. The waiter recommended my Ramen Dish, The Vegan Harvest & it was tasty. I asked for no tofu bc I don't like soft tofu, I like prefer fried! My daughter really enjoyed her Sprouting Up Ramen, there were thick slices of juicy pork, her first bite brought a BIG SMILE. The servers are very busy so be sure to ask for everything you'll need as they're tending to so many people. I wanted some house sauces to add to my ramen but didn't see him in time to get it. The shrimp appetizer was AMAZING!!! My favorite of all, that & the margarita (with Don Julio). I wasn't a fan of the Mojito but finished it bc well, I paid for it lol. My daughter & I both enjoyed our ramen, a little too much, we stuffed ourself to the max! This is a nice place. Every staff we passed on the way out thanked us & said goodnight. Sweet!"

I ordered the vegan bun and the vegan harvest ramen. Sometimes people mess up the order and today was one such day, I asked for additional egg in the ramen and instead they added tofu. "
,,,,,"Vegan Bun was ok, I'm not a fan of impossible meat but it comes with guac. Hence I ordered it and would rate it 3/5. I think impossible meat is quite dry from inside and hence the dry and chewing texture. On the other hand, the ramen was quite nice. I added a shot of hot sauce in it and it just exponentially enhanced the flavors. Try their hot sake ok the side and that will be the perfect dinner on a cold night. They had 3 vegetarian (2 vegan) ramen options, so I'm sure everyone can find a thing to eat."

,,,,,"With 2500+ reviews and a 4.5 star average it's clear Jinya doesn't need my stamp of approval to convince you it's THE place to go for ramen in Houston. Yes, it's a chain - but so what? It still manages to best other local joints in terms of consistency, variety, and service. Here are my thoughts on what I've tried over the years:"
,,,,,"Spicy Chicken Ramen - A favorite of my friends who don't eat pork, this one's a solid choice for first-timers. My ""hack"" is to order the regular Jinya Chicken Ramen and spice it up myself with the hot chili paste at each table - that way you can really tailor it while saving a dollar. Be warned that the chicken chashu isn't as tasty as the traditional pork version; it leans on the rubbery side, doesn't stand up to the aromatic broth, and is honestly the weakest part of the bowl."
,,,,,"Sprouting Up Ramen - My personal favorite! It has so many great additions to it (roasted brussels sprouts, a seasoned egg, chashu) that make it a high-value choice. The soup is a mix of pork and chicken so it's not quite as rich as tonkotsu alone or as clean/pure as chicken alone, but still manages to capture the savory umami-ness of both."
,,,,,"Tangy Shrimp Cilantro - Tried this one for the first time just this weekend and really enjoyed it! It's basically a tom yum base in all but name - this Thai/Japanese fusion is zesty and punchy, with strong flavors of lime, cilantro, and shrimp infusing the thin noodles. The crispy tempura shrimp were fried in a thick shell that held up to the soup. Take caution to remove the lime slices after squeezing in the juice; otherwise, the bottom gets really bitter (learned that the hard way.)"
,,,,,"JINYA Tonkotsu Black - This is their signature tonkotsu bowl and is unapologetically porky, fatty, and luscious. The garlic oil sounds gross but tastes utterly amazing - just make sure you're not on a date when you order this."
,,,,,"Spicy Creamy Vegan Ramen - This is the one vegan ramen I've tried that I fully endorse. I've always been too much of a wimp to order it myself (cause I'm afraid I'll miss out on the meat) but I don't hesitate to sneak spoonfuls of my friends' vegan broth...with a clean spoon, of course. "
,,,,,"Miscellaneous appetizers and rice bowls - Knowing the size of a ramen bowl here, I tend to avoid ordering any extras (so I can save room for dessert elsewhere!) But if appetizers float your boat, the pork gyoza and takoyaki are pretty good and easy to share. The caramelized cauliflower was just okay; I think the brussels sprouts would be a better vegetarian option. Chashu bowls have a high rice-to-topping ratio and don't impress me that much, nor does the Tokyo Curry (which is much better done at Nippon or Go Go Curry.)"
,,,,,Final tips: make sure your party is completely present or else they won't seat you. Go super early or late to avoid the crowds! Enjoy your noodles :)
,,,,,"Hi Chris - Thank you for such an excellent review. Rarely do we get reviews that offer a comprehensive overview of so many of our ramen options. We thank you for your kind words and your tips, and we look forward to your next visit soon!"

,,,,,"Phenomenal! I'm vegan so most of my reviews regard wether or not there are vegan options and if they are good or not, but Jinya has the most amazing vegan options and they even continue expanding them each time I go! The spicy creamy vegan is good, but not spicy enough for my taste, but they have great chili sauce on the side to add extra spice. The Flying Vegan Harvest is my absolute favorite, but I get it without the beyond meat just because I'm not a fan. Also I love any of their cocktails so overall very satisfying experiences every time."

,,,,,"The food is great, but parking is hard to find and it's always crowded. The servers are usually overwhelmed and have forgotten to give me half of my order 2 separate occasions. The lines are usually long and you have to wait forever to get seated, order, get your food, get your check, etc. Basically, every step of service. I would rather order in if I really wanted their food, but it's really heavy and not something I crave a lot anymore."
,,,,,"Hello Joanna - Thank you for your review. I'm sorry for your negative experiences with our wait times. We always encourage guests to visit any of our seven other JINYA locations in Houston, most of which have more reasonable wait times during peak hours. In addition, I understand our location can be somewhat disadvantageous for some, but as far as metered-parking is concerned, the adjacent parking garage -- to our knowledge -- is the only free parking garage in Midtown. However, as you're probably aware, the neighborhood is constantly changing and growing and that might not be the case in the future."

We love the way the components are packaged and particularly appreciate the ""how to"" reheat and assemble instructions that accompany every meal. "
,,,,,"The spicy chicken with pork tonkatsu and an extra egg added is a real winner, but you can't go wrong with anything you order."

,,,,,"I've never really been a fan of ramen places but JINYA is making think that the other places I've been to have just planed sucked. JINYA's environment is absolutely modern and chill. There isn't too much seating and that might be the reason it gives off a lively however, the customer service is amazing. They're incredibly kind and fast. "
,,,,,"The food is also amazing. Because I didn't have high hopes for the ramen, I ordered dumplings, chicken pieces, and a salad as a back up. The dumpling were incredible, not too oily and not rubbery like others. The chicken pieces were crisp and savory. The salad with ginger dressing was a great starter. I was already satisfied. When my spicy pork ramen (I forget the real name) arrived, I took a sip of the broth and was pleased with the flavor. Then I tasted the noodles and I was super impressed. It wasn't that spicy for me since I ordered the second tier of spice, however, I asked my waiter to bring me hot sauce and that definitely completed my dish. Oh and I also had a lychee monitor! And that was refreshing and tasty!"

While we may disagree on whose ramen is better, we can agree on this: Houston is fast becoming the epicenter of excellent, authentic Japanese ramen, and with more ramen-dedicated shops, Houstonians now have more choice, and that, ultimately, is a great thing."

,,,,,First time at this spot but judging by the reviews I was in for a treat. I was a little skeptical because I've had ramen before but never as a Take-out dish. Thanx to the times of COVID I was willing to order ramen take-out. Online ordering was easy but the wait time was quite long (almost 2 hours). This was a Monday night so I thought my order would've been ready a lot sooner. I arrived maybe 30 min. early and sure enough this place was busy. A busy restaurant is a sign that delicious food awaits! Anyhow when my order was ready- pick up was quick and simple. 
,,,,,"Unpacking everything at home was straight forward & instructions were provided. The broth is separated from everything else & once I followed the step and combined both bowls- I slurped my way through the entire meal! I ordered the wonton chicken ramen and it was perfect! The broth was flavorful, the noodles were perfect and the wontons were soft & savory. "
,,,,,What a pleasant surprise! Never doubt ramen takeout from this spot!

Ramen is very beginner friendly to those who don't eat it often. $13/bowl is always interesting for anyone used to top ramen but the taste is very generic and solid tonkotsu. Very fatty and delicious for a chain restaurant. Expect a wait on weekends for dinner"

,,,,,"In a nutshell, this place is a good consistent with decent service, their food is usually always good here with no complaint with mediocre pricing for the area it is in.  Parking especially during peak hours is a challenge since its shares a garage with the 24 Hour Fitness here."

,,,,,"Meh, nothing special. I was surprised at the line at Jinya as I found the food to be pretty subpar and flavorless, as well as expensive. My fiancée and I came here for dinner and it was nothing to write home about. We got the ahi tuna tacos which were cute but just tiny bites, and the ramen didn't have the super rich brothy taste we're used to."
,,,,,I wouldn't really recommend coming here.

,,,,,Ordered JINYA for pick up. I think my rating of 4 stars still stands. 
,,,,,"The pick-up logistics were not the smoothest. It was difficult to stay  COVID-distanced in the small reception area, and there wasn't really a line, making it difficult to navigate. I just wanted to leave that comment in case someone was looking for an easy, COVID-distanced pick-up... this isn't the place."
,,,,,We ordered...
,,,,,- JINYA Buns
,,,,,- Tonkotsu Black Ramen
,,,,,- Cha Cha Cha Ramen
,,,,,"The broth for the Tonkotsu Ramen was quite good -- light and flavorful. The Cha Cha Cha Ramen broth was fine, maybe a little salty when eaten with the Chashu Pork. The JINYA bun was solid, I liked the Chashu a lot. "
,,,,,"Overall, I think this Ramen place has good broth, but I did not think it missed the ""wow"" factor for me. I would find it difficult to pick it out of a line-up."
,,,,,"I heard rumors that JINYA is the best ramen bar in Houston. I would say it was good, but my ramen bowl did not live up to the hype."
,,,,,We ordered the:
,,,,,JINYA Tonkotsu Black Ramen
,,,,,Old Skool Ramen (Chicken)
,,,,,"I think the flavors were good but were missing an extra kick. Also, my ramen came warm (not hot enough though), and I should have said something to my waiter, but didn't want to be *that* customer. "
,,,,,"The atmosphere is lively and the waitstaff was courteous. I would suggest going early, because the restaurant is quite small, and a line usually forms at dinner hours."
,,,,,great ramen! it's so cute how the waiters all greet you when you enter / leave. i like their dip ramen (although it might've been seasonal)

,,,,,Ordered from jinya last night and was pretty disappointed with the quality. I got the spicy chicken ramen and added corn with bok choy. My boyfriend ordered the Jinya Tonkotsu Black Ramen. They packaged it well however the quality of food was a major letdown.
,,,,,The bok choy was old and there was only 2 small slivers of chicken for a $20 bowl of ramen.
,,,,,"Hello Natalie - Thank you for your review. I'm sorry you did not enjoy our ramen. Although takeout ramen is not optional, it is our ONLY option for service at the present time. You said the quality was a major letdown. Can you expound further on what you found wrong with your meal?"
,,,,,"In regards to our bok choy, we prepare fresh bok choy every morning before lunch service, and once more before dinner service. And the chashu we add to our ramen bowls is measured in weight; therefore, the size or length of the chashu pieces are not considered when preparing our bowls. I hope this provides some insight. We look forward to hearing from you."
,,,,,"Thank you,"
,,,,,Jim H. Wang
,,,,,Owner
,,,,,"I've been to several ramen places around town before but Jinya Ramen made quite an impression on me. I like that they have several different broth, noodles, and meat options. Aside from the regular tonkotsu they have chicken broth and even a vegetable broth for vegetarians. Therefore, I decided to try their spicy chicken ramen bc it sounded different and I'm not that into pork belly...(yes, I said it). "
,,,,,"Their chicken charsu meat was very lean yet tender and the vegetables helped mellow out the spiciness of the broth so that the flavor won't overpower and potentially ruin the experience.  For those that cannot handle spicy...I recommend the broth to be ""mild"" in spiciness. If you're up for a challenge...then the spicy hot is the way to go. "
,,,,,Then of course besides the quality of food....there's another important factor to have in order to help create a pleasurable dining experience; decor and ambience of the establishment. I went on a Wednesday night and there was a 15 minute wait( not bad)for a table for two. Due to the way their tables are set up...it seems harder to sit a large group(8+)together and I could only imagine the wait. However...this is a nice place for people to have their date nights at.  The servers are all very friendly and nice. I can't wait to return to try the other types of ramen and appetizers.
,,,,,"A friend and I went to JINYA on a last minute whim and were able to get a seat at the community table without a reservation. The restaurant does appear to be following social distancing rules and wearing face masks & gloves. I saw someone post a picture of the Karaage Ramen which is what brought me in so I got it, and it did not disappoint. The ramen was very flavorful, I got mine spicy and the kick was mild so if you want really spicy make that clear. I like the amount of noodles they put in the ramen, for me those are usually the first to go but there was a good amount to last through the meal. We also tried the caramelized Cauliflower small plate per waitress recommendation and it was very good. I could have eaten the full plate alone. It has a lemony garlic flavor to it. Would definitely come back!"

,,,,,"The broth is good, except if you want spicy. The level of spice for Japanese food is low compared to the serranos and habaneros of Tex-Mex cuisine. "
,,,,,Be weary of their egg topping. I got a mostly set egg white with some light brown from the seasoning. However the egg yolk was not even close to a soft set; it was mostly raw. 
,,,,,"When I asked the waiter to look at the egg, the manager came to the table to explain the seasoned egg was supposed to be soft set, not hard set. I have had my share of soft set eggs, and this was not it."

,,,,,The panna cotta was a dish that I tried for the first time. I enjoyed the ice cream with the custard underneath. The only thing I didn't really enjoy was the graham cracker pieces on the side.

Broth was very flavorful (a tad too salty, which could explain why the ramen was extremely salty overall). I would like to say, the egg was fantastic!"
,,,,,Spicy Tonkatsu Ramen - 3.5/5
,,,,,"Extremely salty like the Tokyo Tonkatsu. I'm not sure why they used different noodles for this one, but I enjoyed the chewiness and thickness of this noodle a lot better than the Tokyo Tonkatsu. Spicy level is pretty low, I could barely taste that it was ""spicy"" and I have a low spice tolerance. "
,,,,,Pork Chashu Bowl - 4/5
,,,,,This rice bowl was definitely the most enjoyable out of the three. It was nicely seasoned and there was a perfect rice to topping ratio. It was very delicious and I would definitely come back just for the rice bowls.
,,,,,"Overall I feel like this ramen bar is a bit overhyped. I would've expected their famous ramen to be the best on the menu, but I ended up enjoying the rice bowl far more. The prices were also on the higher side for a ramen bar. Pretty much most entrees on the money were well over $10. I might consider coming back for the rice bowl, but not the ramen."

,,,,,"I ordered the sprouting up bowl of ramen and I always thought they never gave enough meat but this time my piece of meat was all fat.  My husband got the vegetable soup ramen and it came with just half the soup.  We told the waitress and she said she had to call the manager over because they usually charge for more soup.  We didn't want to make a big deal of it and just told the waitress to charge us for it.  She brought out a big bowl of broth but it just doesn't make sense to charge for extra soup when the bowl clearly didn't come with enough broth.   A little disappointed with tonight's dinner,  probably won't be coming back for a while."
,,,,,"Hello Nancy - Thank you for your review. Please allow me to address some of the important points you made. In the near future, all JINYA Houston locations will be switching back to our original pork chashu recipe after receiving numerous similar reviews."
,,,,,"Next, with all of our ramen bowls, we use a specific ladle to portion the broth with no ingredient estimated nor ""eyeballed,"" otherwise the taste profile would be incorrect. Moreover, if you add more toppings or switch from thin noodles to thick noodles (Vegetable Soup Ramen comes with thin noodles), this will take up more volume in the ramen bowl, ultimately giving the appearance that there's less broth in the bowl. Thank you again for your visit, and please let us know if we can be of further assistance."

,,,,,-Superb lunch service (5/5). Nice and very clean restaurant. We were seated without any wait for our 1pm Friday lunch.

,,,,,"I'm a  fan of Jinya for sit down (before pandemic) and for takeout/delivery during quarantine/pandemic.  When Houston has those ""cold"" days, and I want something warm, not too heavy yet hearty, and comforting, then Jinya always comes to mind. "
,,,,,"I can often order it and pick it up in the time stated on the Yelp app or other food-related app. My food is always correct, still warm, and satisfying.  I also, let's blame the pandemic on this one, get the pair of mochi ice cream bites.  Don't judge! It's also comforting!"
,,,,,I feel like I have a standing order here: Jinya Chicken Ramen with no fried onions and a seasoned egg Plus Mochi ice cream - YUMM (cue Alexis from Schitt's Creek). 
,,,,,"Even when I have had this delivered, they somehow package it, so the broth is warm, the noodles and meat fresh, and the ice cream not melted. It's pretty awesome. "

,,,,,Got the chicken ramen which should be the flagship product and was more expensive than the tonkotsu. Deeply disappointed. The chicken lacked flavor and the noodles were not impressive. The broth also lacked flavor especially near the bottom of the bowl. The given amount was not filling even with noodle refill. On the plus side the service was quite quick and garlic is free.

,,,,,I'm so glad I finally got to try this place out. Food and service was amazing will be back very soon
,,,,,Saturday night dinner date with a friend. This was my first time coming to this spot and the ambience was pretty cool. The service was quick and the food was yummy. I'm not an expert on ramen but I thought it was on point. Oh and the bamboo extras that we got for our ramen omg I could of just ate only that all night it was so good. I loved the flavors.
,,,,,First time coming here and it was bomb!! Our waiter was really nice! The ambiance was nice it was just a nice place overall!
,,,,,"Jinya is the absolute real deal. Looking at the reviews, I knew it had to be delicious, but I had to judge it for myself. And let me tell you...This ramen is to die for. "
,,,,,The broth is 10/10 amazing. Very thick and flavorful. The noodles (I got the thick noodles) were tasty and chewy (in the good way). The toppings on the ramen are great and each add a new element to the bowl. The fried onions are a nice treat and add a sweet element to the ramen. 
,,,,,"The Jinya Bun was great, I just wish I ordered more than one. The steamed bun did split in half when I picked it up, but it didn't really impact the experience at all. Still a great steamed bun. "
,,,,,"All in all, I am eternally grateful I moved a block away from this place because I will be a regular."

,,,,,I love Jinya. This location is usually great. Today the spicy chicken ramen tasted like fish my husband said. He didn't like that. My sprouting up ramen with pork broth only and skinny noodles was on point. I love the Brussels sprouts in it. I always eat them first. The chashu here is always too fatty for my taste. I still come often bc I love it.
,,,,,"Hi Sara - Thank you very much for the stars. We greatly appreciate it. We're very puzzled how our Spicy Chicken Ramen could taste like fish since we carry no ingredients on our preparation line that might create that taste profile. Our only guess is that your husband might have added ramen seasoning to his bowl. The ramen seasoning does contains soy sauce, jalapenos and seaweed, which does taste of fish."
,,,,,"Nevertheless, please know that if our ramen does not meet your satisfaction 100% just let your server know and we will remake your dish or replace it with another item. Thank you again."

,,,,,I have been to other of these Ramen bars in other cities and found the food and service always incredible. Unfortunately one of those was not great at the Houston location.
,,,,,"We went there on Saturday night with my daughter and grandson. It was about 6 PM and they told us he would be about a 20 minute wait. With Covid we were outside waiting it was a little chilly but that's OK we're from New England we can handle it. Once we receded a server and his trainee came over and they were incredibly friendly. They made it a point to interact with my grandson and he felt like one of the group. We ordered some Gyoza and some Ramen as well as the kids meal with came with soup and rice and a couple of other things. We also ordered a beer, cocktail, and soda from my grandson."
,,,,,"After about 10 minutes the drinks came over. Not sure why it took so long but they were busy and didn't look like they were really distancing which was a little bit of a concern but OK. 15 more minutes go by and we have no faith Ramen. My grandson's food came over pretty quickly and he was happy except for his Ramen. The server came by about 10 minutes later, we have been here for 25 minutes now, and explained that he wasn't sure where the Ramen was and would go check. 10 minutes later he came by surprise that we still have not received it he would go check. You see a pattern here. After being seated for 45 minutes we did indeed get our Ramen. It was delicious, but the crazy wait time made us decide not to go here again if ever in Houston. Maybe it was a bad night but it did look like staff was running around like they're crazy"
,,,,,This was only my second time having ramen and I've heard amazing things about Jinya. I tried the vegan bun as well as the vegan spicy ramen. The bun was really tasty and the ramen was satisfying. I think it had great ingredients but I didn't love the broth. I added a few of Trader Joe's vegetable pot stickers and that definitely helped. My rating is more a 3.5 than a 4.

,,,,,They never disappoint every time i come! The vegan ramen is super good great flavors too!!!
,,,,,Service was exceptional. We went on a Sunday around 6pm. It was packed short 5min wait and we were able to sit down. My friend ordered the JINYA bun she said it was very good. I ordered the caramelized cauliflower not very sure which part was carmalized but i ended up adding some seasoning from the table on them and it was super good! I also ordered the Vegan bowl. Initially when they brought it out the flavor was bland... i added some hot sauce from the table and it turned out fantastic! i would definitely go back just to get that bowl again and again! Also they give u ALOT of food so be prepared for to-go. overall very worth it. Price was cheap as well
,,,,,"Chill atmosphere, food was great. Only things I would change is the shouting each time a new customer comes in and not charging extra for hot sauce. Better a customer adds the amount they want than asking spicy and sending it back. I got the dipping noodles and they were amazing. Initially I was disappointed in the Japanese salad, not the normal ginger dressing or greens. But the arugula with the ginger purée was legit. Friend got the vegan ramen and added an egg. All were good and portions were great. Super nice staff."

I've only dined in a few times over the past few years because of this and now I opt for ordering out from Jinya. I've never had issues with my takeout orders. Their ramen is top notch despite being a bit overpriced, and add ons can really bring the price up so be careful. It's totally worth getting on a cold day to warm up."

,,,,,I save 5's for knock me out of the park places but this one was damn near close. Portions were ok size but still a hearty meal for most. 
,,,,,"I had JINYA Tonkotsu Black for lunch and Tonkotsu Spicy for dinner. Both are excellent but I prefer the thick noodles to the skinny noodles. The spicy wasn't too spicy and I added extra spice but I guess my spice levels are more Sichuan China limits. Great flavor, non-the-less. The egg is one of my favorite parts of the ramen meal. Highly recommend getting an extra egg and extra pork. "

Everything ordered was mediocre at best and mildly seasoned.  Tonkotsu black spicy was barely any flavor and can't blame them on spice as I don't know their levels. Still so disappointing on flavor. Had the chicken wonton, if you like chicken noodle soup from a can you're pretty close. Octopus balls must be literal meaning as the octopus inside was non existent. Nice looking dish just eh. The jinya bun was good. It seems they use some quality ingredients they just lack flavor. Pity. Had lychee mule and that was decent. Service was good and quick."

,,,,,Let's be honest. When you think of Ramen in Houston you think of Jinya first and then you look up their competition to try something new. Jinya just has top notch service altogether and their vibe in the midtown location is really nice. There is nothing more relaxing then sitting down with friends after work and having some sake and ramen at Jinya Bar. Midtown in case my non locals don't know is for people age 18 - 35 . typically any older and you are considered a boomer. LOL but in all honesty it is a great place to hang out with friends and meet new people and enjoy the nice dark relaxing tone of the restaurant and let the ramen please those tastebuds and dopamine.

,,,,,I'm from LA and it's a pretty decent spot. I used to going to a place in LA called Tatsu which has 5+ stars in my book. Something about Jinya's food lacks the authentic flavor of Japanese food. Even for a fusion food it's just ok.

I sometimes switch it up with add-ins like Brussels sprouts, which I had never seen before with ramen. They have big, tasty servings and if you order to-go they will package your fixings and broth separately so you don't get soggy noodles. This place is a staple for quick and yummy ramen!"
,,,,,"TLDR: decent ramen, good Japanese curry, excellent service and ambiance."
,,,,,"Stopped by Houston for a couple of days and decided to try this place out due to all the extremely high ratings. My wife and I love a good bowl of Ramen and we were excited to be in a city with some shops that have good reviews (San Antonio lacks on the ramen options). We went with the Tonkatsu black since it was was mentioned multiple times in the reviews and the waiter also recommended it. It wasn't bad but the garlic oil, garlic, and spicy sauce that's mentioned were almost missing when we tasted the broth. Perhaps a little more of each and some salt would have elevated it, but we're no chefs. On a side note, we were very happy to see a place in the mainland finally sell Japanese curry, plus it was pretty good. If we came back this would definitely be the option we would get. "

I prefer to sit at the bar too enjoy my meal or grab a drink when I get food to go. Everything on the menu is delicious. Highly recommend the spicy creamy vegan ramen or vegan harvest. The vegan bun and edamame is also a great appetizer while you wait.

I have posted the items that we had and both were spot on. The amount of food you get for the price was perfect, we had another meal in leftovers. Do yourself a favor make a visit, you won't be sorry."

,,,,,* yummy ramen but not my fave *
,,,,,"i've been to jinya a couple of times now, and it's definitely yummy and a place that i would be willing to go for lunch or dinner, but it's not my favorite ramen place in br..."
,,,,,"that aside, jinya's ramen is pretty good! when i first had it, i thought it was way too salty, but i think maybe i just had a bad bowl. or maybe they were too new. i've since been back to jinya and my ramen was not at all over-salted, which was a super pleasant surprise!"
,,,,,"i do prefer jinya's appetizers to their ramen, especially their jinya buns. the pork belly on these buns literally melt in your mouth, and the bun itself is so yummy and fluffy. their happy hour is the best time to try their appetizers, if you're interested! online it says their happy hour times are from 3-5, but there's a physical sign in front of jinya saying that happy hour is from 3-6."
,,,,,"also there usually is a little wait if you come during peak dinner times, especially on the weekends, but it is worth it! just be prepared to pay if you want to try all their yummy appetizers, drinks, and ramen too."
,,,,,"Hi Mary - Thank you for taking the time to give our restaurant a review. We appreciate your kind words, and I'm especially happy that you enjoyed our fare. We hope to serve you again in the near future."

,,,,,"Jinya is my go-to for ramen in Midtown. Had their mini salmon tacos which was a great starter. Their Brussels sprouts with spicy mayo sauce has the perfect crunch. Finally, I ordered their new shrimp and chicken wonton ramen with chicken broth. I added bok soy, seasoned egg, and broccolins. Have no complaints! Delicious meal. "
,,,,,The wait was very long though. Were told 15 min but intended up being ~35 minutes. People were seated ahead of us when we came before them too (and we had same number in our parties).

,,,,,"I like getting the Tonkotsu black ramen since it's flavorful. Their takoyaki is delicious. Chicken karaage is pretty decent. The spicy tonkotsu is good as well. The goku Midnight black had a huge piece of chasu. Chasu bowl was good. Overall, everything is tasty. The prices for ramen may be on the higher end but they give a lot of toppings included."

,,,,,"I gave this place 3 stars because the service was actually good , but the ramen was just mediocre . Very very bland. We had the Tonkatsu black. It came with very little meat and the Broth was pretty basic. "
,,,,," We eat alot of ramen all over the United States and this ranks pretty low on our list. Also we found the yelling back and forth from host to cooks to be a bit cheesy . I know they are trying to make the atmosphere fun but it gets old about 30 minutes into it.   And no, we are not old people. I think this place is busy because it's a hot spot for young 20 something year old groups when they go out and it feeds off of the success of restaurants next to it."

,,,,,I wasn't sure what to order this was my first time but the waiter was super helpful and not afraid to give honest recommendations from the menu. 
,,,,,The food was cooked perfectly. We ordered the spicy chicken ramen and the Vegan Miso. He loved his food I wasn't crazy about mine but it was still served perfectly. We both loved the spicy tempura shrimp.  
,,,,,We also ordered drinks. They weren't bad but not the best.

,,,,,Crazy story but I went into labor at this location in July. I managed to finish my delicious ramen between contractions and then we headed to the hospital. The servers were great and as always the food was on point. They were quick so we weren't waiting on them forever.
,,,,,This used to be my go-to ramen place in person and via Uber eats... but I think after 2 uber eats incidents wherein this happened I won't buy from Jinya anymore. Uber eats is SO expensive so I only order from Jinya when I really want to because of the extra fees... but wow this is the second time they left out or forgot an entire dish from my orders! I ordered 2 ramens and 1 takoyaki and didn't get the takoyaki. So I basically paid over $100 for 2 bowls of ramen. Basically lost a lot of money... sigh. I think I'm traumatized by now. Don't think I'll be ordering here again.
,,,,,UPDATE 2/3/22
,,,,,Hello Erika - Thank you for your review. We regret to hear about your delivery issues with UberEats. Were you able to receive a refund via the UberEats app? 
,,,,,"Whenever we miss packing an item for a to-go order, we create an incident report so that we can track our staff members' mistakes. However, we also have firsthand experience wherein UberEats and DoorDash drivers have removed items from orders and even have failed to deliver orders after picking them up from our restaurants. We have no control over these incidents, and despite our efforts to determine cause, we receive the same response from these third-party delivery app companies: Instruct your guest to request a refund."
,,,,,"We know this does little to assuage your concerns, but we wanted to let you know that these are the types of issues that come with partnering with these delivery companies."

,,,,,"I used to always go here because there are so few good ramen in Houston. Their gyoza is average, their ramen is average (nothing noteworthy). Their takoyaki are bomb though! Definitely get a Takoyaki!"
,,,,,Their ramen can use a bit more umami and thickness in the broth. A bit thin in consistency for tonkotsu.
,,,,,"The Jinya bun is a must, the crunchiness and freshness of the cucumber balances out the deep flavor of the pork and the fluffiness of the bun. The Jinya Tonkatsu Black has a deep umami flavor,  the marinated egg that's included is creamy and the best I've had. Only four stars because the prices need to be updated on here."
,,,,,Came here on our last night in Houston and I'm so glad we did. Came a little over an hour before closing and this place was packed. Luckily we were seated immediately at the center bar table. Intimate environment. Dim lights with wooden bar tables. There is an open bar at the entrance of the restaurant.
,,,,,"Our group ordered a bunch of dish. I was able to pick at a little of everyone's. My significant other and I got the Tonkotsu Spicy, Tonkotsu black, Lychee Moscow Mule, Jinya bun, and crispy chicken. Their appetizers came out astonishingly fast. The Jinya bun was so good. Right about of fat for the pork belly. The pickled cucumber complemented every bite with a crisp crunch and the mayo added just the right about of creamy to the pork belly. My sister got the impossible Jinya bun and suprisingly, texture wise, you can tell it was vegan meat but the taste, i wouldve assumed it was pork. The crispy chicken was cooked perfectly, not dry but still had a good juicy taste. Their tonkotsu ramen was delicious. I LOVED the thick noodles. Honestly cannot go wrong with it. It was the right texture of chewy and absorbed so much of the broth that it was flavorful. The pork belly inside the ramen was mouth watering. The skin was barbequed perfectly that it had that bitter bbq taste and the fat melts with the meat so well. Only bummer about my ramen was that they did not include a soft boiled egg in my ramen. That's usually my favorite part but my significant other and my sister said their egg was pretty flavorful and delicious. I also got to tried my sister's takoyaki balls which were pretty delicious as well. Not too doughy, had the right amount of mayo and octopus that everything just combined so well in my mouth. I loved my moscow mule. It literally tastes like those lychee jelly cups you get at the asian market but with a carbonated kick."
,,,,,"Service was great. Our server Jovanna was amazing. She was attentive, friendly, helpful, quick and provided the best service. I love her personality and she just made our experience there even better."
,,,,,"Overall, highly recommend this place. I think this is pretty authentic and is now ranked my #1 favorite ramen spot. Just a bummer that it's in a whole other state than home but I would love to come here again if I ever visit Houston."

,,,,,"I just love, love, love Uchi and is my go to for special occasions.  Among many things-I always get the brussel sprouts in the caramel fish sauce, and the eggplant...but the sushi chefs will never steer you wrong. Such a creative bunch and you feel like vip the moment you walk in, till you leave. Such a great and special place with personalized service-if you go once, they remember everything.  Such a unique spot in today's world."
,,,,,I LOOOOOVE UCHIIII!!! 
,,,,,"I have a large appetite, so I usually have to pregame a bit before I eat there. If you're seriously hungry and don't want to go bankrupt .... eat something before you go lol. The portions are small but SO DANG DELICIOUS! I can't snub them for being high end, I gotta blame my appetite. "
,,,,,Great wine selection too! I was seriously impressed with wine selections for a sushi joint. I definitely recommend this spot for at least a special date night or to just try it once.
,,,,,There were so many amazing flavors to try and the ambiance was perfect for this meal. This was by far one of my favorite places I have ever eaten at.
,,,,,"Sushi chef Paolo rocked our world tonight in his headband with a cast of delicate mouth teasers. 50 shades of sushi doesn't begin to cover it. Forced to eat things I generally do not explore certain creatures like salmon, sea bream or skip jack but this was the exception to all of my rules and tonight there were none.....I took a break to explore the environment and discovered thoughtful touches in the powder room. Hair pins and sexy red tissue wrapped toilet paper adorned a quiet subway of relaxation from the crowd for a chance at dabbing the condensation off my brow from eating soooooooo hard."
,,,,,"I'm still tingling from the wagu beef and the fatty toro which melt in the body upon contact. Tradition has been whipped into the shape of futuristic risky flavors. Taking ordinary slices of fish into the outer rings of Saturn. With such combinations of sour, sweet and savory that sting your very soul, burning this pleasure into your memory for eternity. Various hands push and pull dishes in and out of this session silently disappearing into the abyss. The dance of service was graceful like a Parisian ballerina whirling and twirling. We had a front row seat at the bar of Benito bondage from which I did not wish to ever escape from. No safe words needed. Uchi virgin alert! Ginger, soy and wasabi available upon request, if you behave yourself. I was being very bad. Shhhhhhhh! Just eat."
,,,,,"Happy hour was a glorious way to take the training wheels off without sinking our wallet boat. The unfiltered sake spilled over the side of my cedar box and on to the two desserts we were rewarded with. Hidden blueberries peeking through a soft peep hole of moist sponge, starring at a naked lime sorbet crumbled in nutty treasures. Milky dark chocolate sheets chatter and fall from the sky, splattering slowly onto my pallet like a silk pillowcase sliding across a bed. "
,,,,,Hot custard dumplings explode with suprising and delightful thrill. But It just can't be over yet! (Sigh) I didn't want to leave this place of pleasure.
,,,,,I'm hoping this night wasn't just a one night stand but a longterm relationship of cuddling couture cuisine. Parting is such sweet sorrow......oh Paolo!
,,,,,"We love coming to Uchi but with little ones and covid issues it's been hard to get out for dinner. The curbside service and offerings were, as anticipated, excellent. If you haven't tried the dinner for two with wine  and dessert along with several dishes, it's a must do."
,,,,,Every dish we tasted was excellent. I have been twice and have been impressed both visits. I suggest trying as much as you can and reorder your favorites after.
,,,,,"Simply the best sushi I've ever had. This place is an experience and it has become my girlfriend and I's favorite place to eat. It's a bit pricy, but well worth it. Amazing service. Fresh fish. "
,,,,,Get the walu walu to start and finish with the fried milk for dessert. Amazing every single time.
,,,,,Before covid Uchi  was always one of my favorite places to go for special occasions etc.  
,,,,,Not really so much a typical sushi bar as a gourmet fine dining level Japanese centric restaurant.  
,,,,,Wait staff do their very best with giving free reign to choose items to impress .
,,,,,Since covid they have continued to impress in a new way with 2 levels of complete Omacase meals which include a bottle of wine and 2 desserts  to pickup curb side.  We have ordered these several times for a special date night in the safety of our home.
,,,,,"This was our first time trying Uchi and we were very impressed! We went for the sake social hour that begins at 5pm. Our server gave us great recommendations from the daily specials and sake hour menus, and even brought us complimentary Brussels sprouts! We ended dinner with the famous fried milk dessert and it was delicious. There is complimentary parking in the back which is very helpful as there is limited street parking in the area."
,,,,,I have been to Uchi twice: Once for Omakase and once for the Sake Social Happy Hour.
,,,,,Uchi Omakase:
,,,,,"On the menu, there is a Chef's Tasting option of 10 courses and a Signature Tasting option of 6 courses with prices marked as market pricing. I asked the chef beforehand how much they would be for that night, which the Chef replied $125 per person on the Signature Tasting, and I don't recall the other pricing. We chose two Signature Tastings and had an amazing night of wonderful food. The dishes included, but were not limited to, sashimi, nigiri, 36 hour sous vide beef nigiri, tiny fried crabs, brussell sprouts, desserts. The chef really does give you their best wares and it was one of the better nights of sushi I have had here in Texas. Favorites of the night were: gyutoro, flounder muscle, shima aji, uni, and the baby crabs just because they looked cool. *See footnote at bottom."
,,,,,Sake Social Happy Hour:
,,,,,"Came back a second time to try their cheaper fare. Not nearly as much nigiri/sashimi, but we were able to try their creations with sushi. We ordered everything on the happy hour (except the yuca frites) and were happy with the consistency of quality of food from the omakase to the happy hour. The waitress was very keen on our needs and everything was cleaned up very quickly during these COVID-19 times. For dishes, we enjoyed the Murder Point Oysters ($2 per) immensely, followed by the Tempura Walu Walu ($6), Walu Walu ($8), and Hama Chili ($6). Wasn't too keen on the pork belly ($8) but I did appreciate the presentation and creativity on the dish. We also ordered the gyutoro ($10/piece), Scallop ($5.50/piece), Salmon Toro ($4.50/piece), and Amberjack ($8/piece) off the regular menu because it was just that good from last time."
,,,,,*Footnote pertaining to Uchi Omakase:
,,,,,"We misunderstood how Uchi Omakase works. Their omakase isn't the traditional omakase with a set price on a set number of dishes. It is all a-la-carte pricing based on whatever the chef gives you. That being said, unless you tell the chef to stop, he will keep dishing out food (unsure why it even says 10 courses on the menu). We were quite surprised at the bill when we were expecting $250 on the bill but saw a number closer to double. I called back a few days later, as they were busy that night, and mentioned that I thought the menu and chef were ambiguous on the pricing, and the manager was very understanding. Despite COVID-19 concerns just starting up back then (was around March), the manager listened and we came to an agreement that we were both happy with. She was very fair in her decision. With her handling of the situation, and the quality of the food, Uchi will now be a staple on our eating out list."

,,,,,First OMAKASE experience!
,,,,,It was our first time at Uchi Houston and we were very impressed! The flavors and details of every dish blew us away. The service was superb. It was also supposed to be a 10-course meal but our amazing sushi chef gifted us a couple of extras for my sister's birthday!  What an experience!!!
,,,,,It was definitely our first time trying out every single food that was served us so we were drooling the whole time.
,,,,,1. Hirame Usuzukuri - flounder w/ candied quinoa 
,,,,,2. Ajitama Tempura - soft boiled egg tempura 
,,,,,3. Scallop Aguachile - scallops w/ golden berry on chili bath 
,,,,,4. Madai Nigiri - japanese seabream
,,,,,5. Kanpachi Nigiri - amberjack 
,,,,,6. Braised Rabbit - rabbit w/ black garlic and sumac roasted carrots
,,,,,7. Uni Hokkaido - sea urchin
,,,,,8. Zero Sen Roll - yellowtail w/ avocado
,,,,,9. Gyutoro Nigiri - 72-hour short rib
,,,,,10. Sakana Mushi - tom kha w/ sea bass 
,,,,,11. Maguro Goat - bigeye tuna w/ goat cheese and apples 
,,,,,12. Wagyu Tartare - purple potato chip topped with wagyu and egg yolk 
,,,,,"13. Fried Milk - vanilla custard, salted fudge and toasted blondie "
,,,,,14. Apple Okashi - roasted oats with caramel mousse and apples
,,,,,Not in photos:
,,,,,15. Wagyu hot rock - grade 9+ Australian wagyu sirloin
,,,,,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
,,,,,I heard so many good things about this place and was excited to finally eat here ....... Nasty!!!  i dont understand what all the hype was about.
,,,,,Best sushi in Houston and best customer service too! Had a payment issue and it was resolved immediately by Gio. He is excellent. Try their brussel sprouts you will not be disappointed!!
,,,,,"A tasting menu happy hour? Yes, please! The happy hour menu offers a limited selection of some of Uchi's best dishes. Pricing is reasonable and the dishes are great for sharing. My happy hour crew often orders several things for the table, tapas style. Service is always excellent and the vibe is vibin', as they say (They being young folks who know how to appropriately use the word ""vibin'"")."
,,,,,Easily the Best sushi in Houston. Definitely try sitting at the bar or the sushi bar a different experience.
,,,,,WOW. This place blew me away. Every dish that I ordered was so so so delicious. I also liked the whole dining experience. 
,,,,,"Before the dishes came out, they gave us a hot towel to wash our hands with (at least that's what I did lol) and then they gave us a palette cleanser. The palette cleanser was weird because it was a peach taste with strong salt in it. "
,,,,,Afterwards our dishes came out one by one. 
,,,,,Sake sashimi - I believe the is the salmon sashimi dish. This is one of the best raw salmon I've ever had. It was sliced perfectly and the taste kept wanting me to eat more.
,,,,,We had a dish that had lobster in it cooked with butter (i believe) and other stuff. It was a very unique dish because everything in one bite made the whole bite delicious. I wish I could explain this better but it's hard because I don't remember what all was in the dish. 
,,,,,"Wagyu on rocks - the wagyu beef is covered with oil so that you can cook it on the rock. the wagyu beef was so soft and juicy. In this dish, there was a pickled carrot (I think) that you can eat in between each bite so that every bite taste wonderful. "
,,,,,"Unagi nigiri - I love eel and this was so good that I ordered another one (we ordered two and ordered two more). There are many places that have eel, and the eel would be kind of dry, not this one. If you love eel, get this."
,,,,,"Foie gras - we had this dish last and I think it topped the whole dining experience well. The waitr told us to close our eyes when we eat the whole thing in one bite. It was so good. Like this was not what I was expecting. For me, I would described the taste like as if I was eating a juicy thick eel with parts of a pork belly mixed in it. It was really really good. I'm definitely coming back to eat more of this dish. "
,,,,,I remember the scallop dish being good but I don't remember specifics. There were other dishes we ordered and it was good but I don't know if I will reorder those because the dishes mentioned above are way better.
,,,,,"Money well spend ! Started with miso soup than hot sake,  and best sushi And off course the stuff from Japan they ship on the plane ! Yummy food !  Unique menu for sure but one of the servers was very rude for no reason ! It's insane for no reason."
,,,,,"Celebrated my birthday here, the food was delicious, everything we ordered tasted so fresh over all very good food. The service was good, the servers were knowledgeable about their menu and I appreciated their suggestions since it was my first visit. Definately coming back for another round of sushi soon. Thank you Uchi team!"
,,,,,"Uchi. Where do I even begin. I came here for the first time December 30th and since then have been back 3 times. I AM OBSESSED. The flavor combinations and tastebud blowing food is worth the price and for me, life changing.  I love how Uchi combined flavors from all over the world to make their dishes and it makes me really think about the thought behind the bites. "
,,,,,"I recommend trying this place during the Sake Social 5-6:30 and if you don't have a reservation, go wait outside at 4:40ish and you will get in when they open. "
,,,,,"Mostly everything I've had on their menu I love. Highlights are definitely the Karage (fried chicken thighs), Kinoko Nabe is a must, the Wagyu is amazing, and I love all the fresh cool tastings especially the Hama Chilli and Yaku Berry. "
,,,,,"When you go, don't opt out on desert! THE FRIED MILK IS A MUST TRY. My friend describes it as ""a shot of cereal in your mouth"". It's truly an experience"
,,,,,"I've eaten at a table and the sushi bar and both are really great experiences. I had a great dining experience being served by Santo, a sushi chef, who was so funny and an excellent fish slicer. The head Sushi chef is great too. It's really fun to watch them make all the sushi with such precision but also having so much fun doing it. "
,,,,,CAN'T wait to go back. 
,,,,,"Also if you buy their cookbook, you will receive a $25 gift card"
,,,,,"After many years of going to Uchi, it is still my favorite in all of Houston. They never disappoint with their vegan options. Just delicious! The service has is great as well!"

,,,,,"You can never go wrong with happy hour here. The scene is lively with great hour prices, delicious food, and excellent customer service. However, save yourself the pain of waiting, make a reservation! With that aside, the sushi and sashimi dishes here are Bomb as well as many other dishes! If unsure what to eat, go for the omakase (chef's tasting menu) or ask your server for recommendations. "
,,,,,Ordered from HH menu known as sake social (served 5 PM to 6:30 PM daily) - all items below are recommended:
,,,,, * yokai berry
,,,,, * hama chili (always my favorite)
,,,,, * walu walu
,,,,, * pork belly
,,,,, * kushiya
,,,,, * spicy sake maki
,,,,, * oysters
,,,,, * foie gunkan
,,,,, * chef's choice of nigiri which was tile fish
,,,,,For dessert from main menu that you must make room to try:
,,,,,* blueberry taro
,,,,,* fried milk
,,,,,Complimentary valet is offered behind the restaurant. Don't try to walk-in without a reservation as they're usually booked.
,,,,,"Reservation is a-must if you do not want to wait especially on the weekends. This is one of the best sushi place in town. Located in Montrose, limited parking on the streets. It's best to do the complimentary valet parking. The ambience here can range from classy to trendy. "
,,,,,The staff is always friendly with excellent service. They are very welcoming and knowledgeable of the menu. You can select from the menu or do the omakase which the chef's selections for the night. It's spontaneous not knowing what you're going to get each time. 
,,,,,"I would recommend sitting by the bar, you get to see the chef in action. The Uchi chefs are very talented with the way they cut the sashimi or garnishing each dish. You can ask the hostess to sit you by the bar. One thing that is a must-try here is the fried milk. It's their specialty dessert. I love every bit of it and it was the perfect way to end dinner."
,,,,,"Someday I will eat sushi in Japan, until then I have Ichi!!!  Came for my birthday last Thursday and was not disappointed.  We ordered a ton of food and all were amazingly delicious.  The combinations they come up with are original and masterfully prepared.  Service was outstanding.  Make reservations ahead of time and don't miss out on the fried milk dessert."
,,,,,"I mean where do I start? Everything was so spectacular. We came here to celebrate our 1 year anniversary. Luckily we hit their hh time on a Sunday. Our server was really nice and helpful. We ordered 4 rolls, a few uni and a few appetizers. And also 2 sake bomb sets. You can tell that it gets quite busy at the restaurant on the weekend because the place got packed. Quick. "
,,,,,"Everything tasted perfect and delicious. I would recommend 1 sake set if you're just drinking casually because it was actually hard to finish 2. And we are hard hitters when it comes to sushi, sake bombs and hh. They gave us free stir fried Brussels sprouts because our order was taking a bit. Now I have a new found love for fried Brussels sprouts. But honestly anything on the menu was great and didn't feel like I was just eating rice and raw fish. "
,,,,,Valet parking is in the back of the restaurant!
,,,,,"I love this place everytime I come. The service is impeccable, food is amazing and prices are well worth it. I always come for the omakase as it's so worth it. The quality of fish is very yummy!"
,,,,,Wow wow wow! 
,,,,,"Stopping by to eat at Uchi is mandatory if you visit Houston. Deliciously affordable, it's one of my favorite restaurants in Houston. "
,,,,,"The chef tasting menu will keep your stomach filled to the brim with food. Their happy hours are exceptionally well priced as well (Saturdays 5-10PM). For an up escape restaurant, I can't believe I was able to get drinks between $5-6. "
,,,,,Favorite dishes:
,,,,,Walu walu
,,,,,Fried milk 
,,,,,Salmon sushi (happy hour menu) 
,,,,,Beef wagyu
,,,,,See attached pictures for reference!!
,,,,,Hands down some of the best food I have ever had. The staff was unbelievable in knowing the menu and helping you pick the right plates to come out. An awesome experience!
,,,,,Happy hour is so worth it. Could probably do 35-40$ per person and be happy and full.
,,,,,Highly recommend the following menu:
,,,,,Hama chili
,,,,,Namahotate
,,,,,Yokai berry
,,,,,Foie gras nigiri
,,,,,Coconut Tapioca
,,,,,Avocado
,,,,,"My go to for any occasion that needs celebrating. You will be so well taken care of at uchi by the staff and the chefs!! I have done omakase 2 times here (would absolutely recommend for an awesome experience). The omakase (about $120 per person) is good if you aren't to picky and don't want to have to figure out what's good on the menu. If you need sushi suggestions they will definitely give you advice. My personal favorites are the blue fin tuna, red cornet, sea bream, and striped jack fish! A great time to go is during happy hour for !!!sake!!! and rolls are a good price. Other non sushi favorites are the brussel sprouts and the rabbit (you will be surprised, it's so good! Melts in your mouth.) "
,,,,,I recommend making a reservation so you don't have to wait for over an hour because they are pretty much always busy.
,,,,,"Great place with amazing food  And customer service,  Highly recommended,  Thank you Uchi.!"

,,,,,"We have gone many times but the most recent one was a little disappointing. Did omakase and advised our server we wanted mostly sashimi with very minimal cooked dishes. 5 of our dishes were meat dishes: beef, duck and goat dishes. This was not what we expected from our favorite sushi restaurant in the city. The wagyu was extremely chewy and should be taken off the menu if that's the quality that is being served. For the amount of money spent with each visit here, for the first time, we felt unimpressed and almost ripped off. Not to mention at the 2 hour mark we are given our bill and literally told we should pay and leave ASAP because of other reservations! Not even during COVID with their limited capacity were we rushed out. May have made our last visit here."
,,,,,"MIXED FEELINGS, this was my first time and I ordered several rolls and several sashimi pieces. If your palette lacks the depth to respect different cuts and species of fish and meat then you'll be heavily disappointed to pay these high prices. So, If you're food enthusiast like me and still want to try this place: it is a must. I suggest you talk it out with your server about what you enjoy and want before order because it is easy paying for something in order to realize it's unjustified."
,,,,,"Bottom line, open your eyes and bring someone special. The place is an experience you have to spend time designing for yourselves. If so, it'll be amazing."
,,,,,What can I say about Uchi at this point that hasn't already been said? My friend Christina raves about this place and tells me it's hands-down one of her favorite (if not her favorite) Japanese restaurants in all of Houston. It lived up to the hype and it was beautiful.
,,,,,"No surprise, but I recommend reservations. This place is permanently packed from open to close. It's a moderate size restaurant and would be perfect for any date night. It's loud, but it's cozy enough to be intimate. We got a reservation and sat at the sushi bar. I think this allows for the best experience. You are thrown into the proverbial trenches with the sushi chefs and you get to watch them masterfully work their craft. The chefs are friendly, helpful, entertaining, and such a joy to interact with."
,,,,,You can look at the pictures I posted to get an idea of what kind of food you can expect. Don't come here expecting California rolls or sweet and sticky rolls drenched in sauces. This is classic and clean high-end sushi with a nice neo-modern twist. Most of your senses will be delighted with the different savory to sweet profiles.
,,,,,"Some of my favorites were the salmon belly, yellow tail everything, and really just ask the chefs for recommendations. They won't let you down as everything tasted like a new experience. The thing I DIE FOR is the foie gras. GOOD. GOD. It was a culinary orgasmic experience. I've never tasted anything so sweet, juicy, succulent, savory, that offered this beautifully light crisp on the outside while maintaining a buttery-melt-in-your-mouth finish. It is unreal. You could have it for dessert honestly. The ACTUAL dessert of fried milk is really good. It's condensed milk fried in a doughnut like casing served with ice cream. It's a dream. The grand total for 4 of us was about $80 a person after tax and tip. It'll cost you a pretty penny, but it's worth it."
,,,,,"Everything you heard about Uchi is true. It's incredible. Get a reservation and come to have your mind and senses tickled and caressed as you enjoy fresh, unique, delicious Japanese cuisine."
,,,,,"My first Uchi experience was take out during Covid. They canceled our reservation because they'd stopped serving indoors recently, and so we had to order to-go. VERY STRONG 4.5 overall experience probably because I'd had high expectations, but the food was delicious regardless. In my opinion, as a first timer, the zero sen ($12.50) is a must. We tried eight fairly popular dishes, and that was definitely our favorite."
,,,,,"Never a disappointment here! Everything is great, every time we have been at Uchi.. everything is great, they help you and describe to taste.. will continue to come here for special occasions.."
,,,,,"It was a girls dinner during happy hour and we had a great time. Food was absolutely delicious! Service was fantastic (very busy during happy hour) and very attentive. There is something for everyone, our party had 2 adventurous sushi lovers, a vegetarian, and a non sushi admirer. There is a vegetarian menu (huge plus because I'm the vegetarian) and there's also something for meat lovers. I've missed sushi since my recent transition to becoming a vegetarian but I honestly left feeling completely satisfied. I had the Nasu (Japanese eggplant) and the Chef's choice makimono and both were delicious."
,,,,,"Food was great. Service was shady. I'm not a chronic reviewer of restaurants, but I feel obligated to say something. Our server was Matt with the Mullet (10/28/21). Our party of four had never been here, and when we told our server this, he excitedly offered to start us off by bringing out ""a few recommendations"". We loved that idea, since it would give us a chance to look over the menu as a group. We didn't see Matt more than once over the next hour or so, while the wait staff proceeded to bring us out a good 10-15 dishes - very expensive ones. We were fine with him bringing out a ""few"" surprises, but 10-15 does not ""a few"" make. He never once came back to ask us for our order, and random people just started arriving with random dishes - nonstop. Secondly, the birthday girl of the night let him know she does not eat beef. This was the only guidance we gave him and around 30% of his dish selections had beef in them."
,,,,,"We take full responsibility for not stopping this sooner -- that's on us and we'll live with the consequences -- but our bill for four people was over $1,000 for four people and there's no way Matt didn't know exactly what he was doing -- hosing us. It's a shame, because instead of recommending this place for the food, we left with a bad taste in our mouth. Shady!"
,,,,,"Wow! From the moment I walked in to the second I walked out I probably was speechless multiple times. 1) the attention from the waitstaff was fantastic. They were super welcoming and helpful explaining each of the dishes. 2) the food is absolutely amazing. The tapas style dishes are small but absolutely worth it. I swear its like taking a bite into culinary magic. Although there are more options available and the portions are bigger during  dinner, but the sake social from 4-6:30 is the best way to get a taste of Uchi for a great price. It really makes fine dinning a more affordable experience.  But honestly, once you try Uchi you really begin to see food and cuisine differently."
,,,,,"I came here with the knowledge that the sushi BAR was part of well the BAR, and that I was able to walk in and sit there, after standing for an hour on heels, finally a space at the bar was open and I was asked to moved because it wasn't part of the BAR even though it's called sushi BAR and it's not a table like the rest, I think that's BS because that's not what I was told, I think that they should've explained themselves better when I called, if they would've told me that, I wouldn't have waited all this time, poor communication at this place, never coming back, waste of time"
,,,,,....
,,,,,"Update, talked to the manager, tried to get an explanation and I was just told to wait for an other hour, thanks Mr. Steven for the great explanation, I still believe that this place needs to work on their communication and train their employees more on how to explain on the phone better and get back to people on time"
,,,,,"A year ago I wrote a review on Uchi. A whole year ago. Now, some time later, my love has only grown for Uchi. "
,,,,,"It's a special place and their staff aren't just employees to my wife and I - they're friends and people we go to visit with when we dine. To us, part of the beauty of dining out, is getting to know the staff. At Uchi from the top led by GM Gio, to their reservation manager Karen, to their private party coordinator Jessica, to all of the chefs, waitstaff, and reception.. you get amazing people who genuinely care about your experience when you're there. Chefs Bigler (sushi) and Chris (kitchen) lead Uchi to greatness day in and day out. We can't go a week without getting ""the itch"" to return and these wonderful people are just as special to us as the food. "
,,,,,They also have an incredible happy hour.. good luck to anyone who can find this level of quality food that's thoughtfully done and presented for the value they give you on HH. 
,,,,,COVID stuff: They are incredibly safe and take it seriously which is why we have ventured back from previously going 2x a week before the world fell apart. They space out tables and reservations. Management doesn't play around with this which is great to see. 
,,,,,Food: It's amazing. Duh. Everything. Literally. 
,,,,,Uchi is an incredible place. Go there. Fast. You deserve it.
,,,,,"I honestly don't even know where to start with this review. I could begin my mentioning the amazing sushi chefs, Albert, Santos, Jacob, Justin, just to name a few. I could begin to thank the amazing waitstaff who work as a cohesive unit to give each diner the most amazing service possible. I could even begin by thanking the wonderful people in the front of the house who asked me what the special occasion was we were celebrating. My wife and I went to Uchi yesterday to celebrate our 2nd anniversary. We asked to be seated with Albert who is one of our favorite sushi chefs. The staff had our reservation ready for us and we were seated 20 minutes earlier than we expected. Everyone seemed to know it was our wedding anniversary by the time we sat down. It was incredibly special. My wife and I go to Uchi often, not just on special occasions, so it was really nice to feel so important to the staff."
,,,,,"Albert quickly greeted us and congratulated us on the 2 year milestone. He recommended us special things to order that they don't get often. The food, as always is phenomenal. But what you don't hear on many reviews is how phenomenal the PEOPLE are. Each sushi chef engages their guests, they genuinely care about you and want you to have a great experience. Albert asked us if we had any allergies, was hilarious the entire time we were with him, and actually cared if we were having a good time. We had just missed social hour but he made sure to get us what we wanted in time before it officially ended. He also had solid suggestions for us such as the rabbit, gizzard, and some other items that were just too good for words. The desserts here are also insane - we had the fried milk and a peanut butter mousse. "
,,,,,"I can't thank the staff enough, especially Albert, who is officially our go-to sushi chef. I'm not the biggest sushi person (I eat sushi with a fork lol) but my wife loves Uchi and now I love Uchi not only for the food but the people who work there."
,,,,,THANK YOU ALBERT AND UCHI FOR MAKING OUR 2ND ANNIVERSARY SO SPECIAL. You guys are amazing and we truly appreciate you.

,,,,,"Uchi never disappoints, and always delivers. The waitstaff is very attentive and helpful in choosing menu items. This is still one of of my favorite sushi places in Houston."
,,,,,Uchi is our place to go for special occasion dinners for the last 6 years+ and we have always found both the quality and creativity of food amazing.  We normally order Omakase but recently we decided to order from the menu.  The server was very helpful with suggestions and with taking multiple rounds of food orders.  The orders came very quickly and as usual the dishes were amazingly delicious.  The only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating to Uchi is because of the décor and non-uniform temperature control in the dining areas.  The restaurant needs to improve the décor to provide a more elegant dining experience.
,,,,,"I don't know why it's taken us this long to write a review. We have been going to Uchi for years, both for happy hour and dinners. Our first date 4 years ago was here, after which we have come back every 6 months for our anniversaries/half anniversaries and, most recently, for our wedding dinner. Every time, Uchi never ceases to exceed our expectations in food and service. Everyone is fantastic, though we have a soft spot for Anthony, who served us on our first date and every date thereafter for the next 2 years. "
,,,,,"As for the food, honestly everything is good. Off the top of my head, I would say to get the Uchi salad, spicy tuna roll, and Fried Milk. We could eat those every day, repeatedly, until we become old, fat, and broke. Go for happy hour if you're feelin' frugal."
,,,,,"So to be honest I came here to leave a good review. I spent $240 the food was good whatever. I went on 9/28/2020 for my 3 year anniversary & they gave me this $25 off card and said ""so you don't have to wait another year to come back"" okay super thoughtful until I noticed today 10/3/2020 that the $25 off expired 2 DAYS after they gave it to me. This isn't Mcdonalds. Who goes back two days later to spend that kind of money again."
,,,,,"Best sushi ever! Let the waitstaff order for you, you'll have the most incredible experience"
,,,,,Excellent experience!!! Have the chef or your server surprise you... it is to die for!! Worth every penny. This place is by far my favorite sushi restaurant in Texas and California combined... and trust me I have been a sushi lover for close to 18yrs. I have lived in Cali and Texas... here are some of the photos. Word cannot express the experience. Enjoy!
,,,,,"As everyone has said before me, Uchi is amazing! One thing I have to add is the Jasmine Cream for dessert. The fried milk dessert was great like everyone said but very sweet with the chocolate, caramel, and ice cream. If you don't want such a sweet dessert, I recommend the Jasmine Cream instead. The granola at the bottom gives you sweetness and the cilantro at the top balances it out for a very refreshing dessert."
,,,,,This is not your typical sushi restaurant. My husband and I came here for date night and and I was thoroughly impressed by the creativity and flavor of their dishes. The staff us amazing and the food was impressive.
,,,,,It's a great experience. The ambiance is very welcoming and charming. Amazing service. Staff are extremely knowledgeable and make great recommendations
,,,,,One of the best sushi spots in town. Great location in Montrose with valet parking to help get you in to one hell of a sushi dining experience!

,,,,,The food continues to be decent and the fish fresh. 
,,,,,We got:
,,,,,- spicy crunchy tuna * 
,,,,,- negi hama futomaki
,,,,,- spicy sake maki 
,,,,,- sake kiwi 
,,,,,- machi cure * 
,,,,,- foie gras nigiri 
,,,,,"- salmon belly, slightly seared - disappointing "
,,,,,- sake namida - fancier summer roll but esp disappointing with cilantro 
,,,,,- half order of Brussels sprouts *
,,,,,The orders came so sparsely. Our wonderful waitstaff Aisha got us:
,,,,,- Hama chili
,,,,,- avomaki 
,,,,,"The starred are my favorites. 2.5 stars for food, 1.5 for service so 4 overall :)"
,,,,,So the food continues to be stellar. No qualms or doubts there. 
,,,,,But don't go here on a first date. 
,,,,,"The food is served so sparsely and over time. We sat for two hours. And two hours is a long time for a first date. Sure, two hours can fly by with some people. But with some, it can be painfully long. I think my date and I would've had a better time at dinner had it taken half the time. "
,,,,,"The chef also forgot our sushi order. At that point, it was fine. We dashed out of there as soon as the bill was paid. Sigh."
,,,,,Best raw fish in town. And up there for best service. 
,,,,,"Caveat: I love nigiri (fish on rice)/sashimi/oysters so those are what I eat in Boston, NY, Seattle, and California. Read: primarily only in those places, where the fish is fresh. (Raw seafood is, admittedly, the one ""food group"" I'm picky about and will appear to be a snob for. Please excuse me.) Although I've had decent salmon pieces at Osaka, I had pretty much given up finding good fish in Houston. Until yesterday when I walked into Uchi. "
,,,,,"I walked in on a Tuesday around 6. The decision to go there was made on a whim. My party (totaling two) had not arrived so I headed to the bar. Delicious $3 nigori sake for sake hour ending at 6:30pm. I ordered one of those as well as the pan-fried pork and baked walu walu. Both were ok but the sake was the best of three. The bartenders are attentive, polite, and friendly. Nathan has a great smile. The patrons are sophisticated. "
,,,,,My party arrived and we ordered the following; I'll describe the highlights:
,,,,,Kusshi (oyster)*
,,,,,Nigiri of:
,,,,,- shime saba (mackerel)
,,,,,- salmon
,,,,,- hamachi (yellowtail)
,,,,,- ankimo (monkfish liver)
,,,,,- scallop*
,,,,,Sashimi of:
,,,,,- salmon belly*
,,,,,- shime saba*
,,,,,- tuna
,,,,,- golden tobiko 
,,,,,Fried Milk
,,,,,Sea bream*
,,,,,"*How I missed Kusshi. It came dressed in a few things, which I normally prefer without, but this was an excellent, briny yet sweet, fresh oyster, and the pairings were good and not overpowering. "
,,,,,* Freshest scallop I've had raw. 
,,,,,* Best salmon belly I've had. Prettiest marbling ever. Served with drops of salmon roe. 
,,,,,"* Whatever they put on top of the mackerel sashimi was not on my nigiri,  and I wish it had been on it, too. This is good mackerel. Not too fishy. That only happens when it is extra fresh. "
,,,,,"The fried milk, for me, was more a culinary experience than a repeat dessert. Certainly pleasing to both the palate and eyes, but I'll try other desserts before going back to it. "
,,,,,"Now, Matt. He should be awarded the Staff of the Day. Did he take care of us. And his recommendation of sea bream* in shiso oil and citrus with tobiko was the best dish of the night. Charming. I also like that different servers who brought out the dishes were all very well-versed in describing each dish. And when I asked one of them for wasabi, he was sharp enough to bring the ginger with it as well. Charmed. "
,,,,,"The ambience is great - modern without being cold (I especially love the large old-school looking bulbs), nice kitchen, good cook books on shelves (a rather prominently-displayed Robuchon haha). The tables are close together but feels intimate, not cramped, and somehow the conversations stay separated between tables. The best kind of noise level. "
,,,,,Four stars for food but another star for service. My only critique would be:
,,,,,"- The nigiri tasted fine but the cuts were too thin. Actually, all the cuts are on the thin side (but the sashimi cuts are at least wider than nigiri cuts). And the ankimo really could be bigger. Monkfish livers are big."
,,,,,"- The rice could carry a little more flavor and stick a little better. At Urasawa, if a nigiri falls apart, the chef makes you another one ;) not that I'm expecting that."
,,,,,- Could you please invest in better shoyu and wasabi? Grated root tastes much better. And some people don't like low sodium soy sauce. 
,,,,,"- Please bring in more oysters, especially in these winter months! Kudos on Kusshi, and please add Beau-soleil, Malpec, and Kumamoto!"
,,,,,"But that's nit-picking. Overall, it's my new favorite restaurant in town :) I'll be there as frequently as possible. "
,,,,,"Private rooms available. Complimentary valet, just tip."
,,,,,Celebrated my birthday there. Outstanding service. The food service went faster than pre-covid times. I remember eating here and taking almost 2 hours from appetizers to the check. Now I guess they sped up the process. Always a fan of the brussel sprouts and the shishito peppers.
,,,,,"I usually get some (6) avocado sushi, a gyumaki roll (kimchi & grilled short rib), and a spicy crunchy tuna."
,,,,,One of the top 3 sushi places in Houston hands down!
,,,,,"Can't compare the original Austin location because that place is my favorite. But this is just as good! If you like avocado rolls, you have to try it here because they have the best avocado rolls in Houston! I usually get like 2-3 orders. Also have to try the brussels sprouts and the shishito peppers."
,,,,,This review is for their delivery service (doordash) during the time of Coronavirus.
,,,,,Brussels sprouts - I love this dish. I've tried to re create the sauce and can't. It's sweet and savory all at once.
,,,,,"Whitefish w ponzu(?) - I was very impressed by the texture of this fish! To be able to sear it, let it sit in a car ride to my house, and then let me take a photo of it before eating, and it was still perfect. "
,,,,,"Sake namida- this roll is like eating Vietnamese food, but elevated. It captures that flavor, but the salmon and avocado bring it to a higher level."
,,,,,"Assorted nigiri - all pieces were excellent. There's just enough rice, not too much to overpower the taste of the fish. You know how they say if the sushi is made correctly, you shouldn't need soy sauce? Well this is that sushi. I didn't use soy sauce and each piece was full of flavor."
,,,,,10/10 will order again bc I'm not leaving the house anytime soon..!
,,,,,"Came to Uchi for my mom's birthday back in December, and we had a wonderful experience. The waiter we had was super friendly, patient, and helpful cause it was my family's first time, and we wanted some recommendations as to what to order (on top of what family friends had suggested to us). In order to sample a bit of everything, we decided to go with the omakase signature tastings and then order some of our own picks. Although my parents aren't super informed about sushi, they loved the experience and the food. Because of how happy they were, I also enjoyed the experience. I will say the food was definitely delicious and was complimented by excellent service. One thing to note is the restaurant seems to always be pretty busy, even on weekday nights! We went on a Monday night with a reservation and still had to wait on the back patio for 20 or so minutes. Wasn't too troubling though cause we got some drinks in the meantime. "
,,,,,We used the restaurant's valet parking although I'm sure some people may park on nearby streets and walk over.
,,,,,"My family enjoy their 10 course omakase. Each dish was unique and an eye opener for me. My favorite dish was their fried milk dessert...it had every element of a perfect dessert: crunchy, soft, cold, warm, sweet, and a bit of saltiness. Uchi will always be my special go to spot!"
,,,,,"So I go to sushi places from time to time, but I have to admit, that I have never been to Uchi in Houston. It's the most upscale sushi place I have ever been to. I sat at their wine bar as I decided to dine alone. The venue is low lit and personable. The light only shines bright on where they present the dishes. It's all about presentation and flavor here. When you order sake, they present it to you in a wooden box because the wood helps extract the true potential of the sake flavor. The food is often laid to rest on wooden boards. The bartender was so thorough and offered excellent company with her ability to engage in open dialogue. They have several different menus you can choose from with an array of flavors. Pictured is:"
,,,,,Hirame-flounder 
,,,,,"Hama Chili-yellowtail, ponzu, Thai chili, ginger"
,,,,,"Spicy sake maki- salmon, aka Kosho, avocado "

,,,,,This place used to be good. Sad to see that they have become the epitome of haughtiness. We went there for my birthday. Waited for 2 hours and when we were finally seated our server did not care to explain the menu or offer water to our toddler. She was very rude. There are so many places like Uchi that is not child friendly and it is not okay! Sure the food may be great but the poor service we received was unwarranted. There are so many great options out there and I'd much rather take my money where it would be appreciated.
,,,,,"The place totally lives up to the hype around it! Food is beyond fantastic. The servers are extremely hospitable and help you with the menu. I have been to the restaurant quite a few times now and it  NEVER disappoints. Staff is excellent , from the person who receives you at the door to the servers. If you enjoy Japanese food, it's a MUST VISIT!"
,,,,,"Favorite restaurant in Houston. 10/10 on all fronts. Service, food, ambiance - stellar."
,,,,,"Uchi has been one of the most unique dining experiences I've ever enjoyed. Each dish was delicious, and the menu is so expansive that you can try something new each time you dine in. The service was impeccable."

,,,,,"First time at Uchi. Definitely not the last time. For the most part, the dishes came out one by one - giving us time to appreciate each one, albeit the small portion sizes. Exquisite presentation made each dish special."
,,,,,My husband and I ordered their take home menu on our anniversary. It was extremely thoughtfully prepared and a fun experience to have together. Every part of it was excellent.
,,,,,"I live in Los Angeles and have been to numerous sushi restaurants.  I am not the hugest fan of sushi but enjoy it from time to time; however, this has got to be one of the tops 10 restaurants I have had the pleasure of dining at.  We ordered the vegetarian and regular 6 course dining options and both blew us away. There was not a course that did not impress us.  Then, to top it off, the cilantro desert was unexpected and amazing.  Definitely give this place a try.  I was only in Houston for an overnight layover, but I will need to come back here soon."
,,,,,"This is my first time been to Uchi. Everything is great, the service, the ambiance, and the food presentation are awesome. Only the taste of the food and the quality of fish didn't live up to the hype. They are good but can be better. The wait time for roll/sashimi/nigiri becomes long (~30 min) around 7 PM."
,,,,,"We had the perfect girls' night on the patio at Uchi. We ordered the chef's recommendations for the table and had a great variety of white wine, rosè, and champagne. We still crave this meal regularly."
,,,,,Roberto & Alberto were so great! We went for a first time and they were so accommodating and fun! We enjoyed ourselves so much I would totally go back
,,,,,"what is there even left to say about love. i vividly remember the first time i tried escolar at uchi during an austin restaurant week in my undergraduate years and consider that the moment i became a genuine fan of sea fare. when i think of the weeks after my fiancé and i made our intentions official, i remember the complementary glass of bubbles and the considered engagement of our server here. this is the first place that i tried a dozen-plus ingredients that i otherwise would have avoided out of ignorance. there is an ineffable value to trust - and, that is the compliment i can offer uchi. i trust them to provide me with an experience no matter how many times i visit, no matter how seemingly insignificant the particular moment, and no matter what i order on the menu. and, whether that visit is in austin, montrose, or denver, i trust that experience to feel a touch like home. "
,,,,,(p.s. their play on short rib nigiri is one of the single most flawless moments i have ever experienced. do yourself the favor.)
,,,,,"Amazing dining experience. For starters this place does not feel like it is in the middle of a busy street in Houston. For my reservation i sat at the bar & I highly recommend this. The servers were helpful, friendly, & very knowledgeable.  This was a tasting experience & every roll, dish, appetizer, we tried was 10/10. The popular items listed are a hit & this place just feels like a hidden getaway in the middle of the city. Highly recommend & plan to return."
,,,,,The most amazing sushi!  Never disappointed.   If you are visiting from out of town... go!  You won't regret it!!
,,,,,"Lots of vegetarian options, and highly recommend the chef's choice makimono roll! The chef makes a custom roll depending on how they feel that day, so every time it's unique!"

,,,,,Terrible experience with a server who tried convincing us to sing for someone's birthday - and wouldn't let it go - interesting meal BUT the cocktails were lovely! Food was underwhelming unfortunately but I'd go back for their gin!
,,,,,"Took my boyfriend here for a birthday dinner and we are both vegan. They were able to create a vegan omakase menu for us pulled from the vegetarian omakase. Had a wonderful time and the flavors were fantastic, so similar to fish! Our favorite was the tomato nigiri, which was so similar to tuna nigiri - taste & texture! Absolutely loved it and will return in the future"
,,,,,Hands down the best sushi I have ever had. Sat at the bar and had the sushi chef just make whatever he thought was great. Couldn't have had a better experience. Will go to this place anytime we are near one.
,,,,,"Expect to blow your budget on this one; however, expect to be equally thankful to be human and alive. Try a cold sake in Bamboo. Thank me later."
,,,,,"The food was great, but the service & experience is what makes Uchi a 5 star place!"
,,,,,"We came here for our anniversary. We had a reservation at 5. Arrived at 4:40, and the line was out the door! They don't open doors officially until 5. Make sure you have a reservation to ensure you have a table. We watched a young woman in front of us throw a fit b/c she could only be seated at the sushi bar as a walk-in. "
,,,,,"We were seated immediately and every employee we encountered wished us a happy anniversary. So sweet! We took a bit to pick from the happy hour menu so our waiter told us he'd pick a few of his favorites for us. They were all amazing! My favorites had to be the social pork, avocado 2 piece, walu walu, and yuca frites. The social pork literally melts in your mouth! Avocado 2 piece had such intricate flavors. "
,,,,,"We also got the sake kiwi, machi cure, and foies candy bar. I enjoyed all these dishes, but wasn't a super fan of the candy bar; I loved the fried milk and it was sincerely well worth it. It has 3 types of chocolate, including the most delicious mousse, and 3 fried balls that cream seriously just pops & melts in your mouth. You need to try this when you're here at least once! "
,,,,,"Everything you eat here is something you can't find elsewhere. Happy hour menu is made to be shared and is really only composed of 2-3 bites, but we ordered 8-9 servings and it filled 2 pretty quickly. "
,,,,,For our anniversary they brought us the cantaloupe  dish and said it was on the house. Such a small gesture but this sincerely made our night. They also gave us a $25 gift card for next time.
,,,,,"Overall, I was highly looking forward to eating here. Had been waiting for months, and surely, they exceeded all expectations and will continue to be the gold standard of fine dining and excellent service moving forward. You need to go!"
,,,,,"Our server, Hudson, had a plethora of knowledge about the origins of the restaurant and food he served. We had the Omakase, 10 course serving. Hudson asked us several questions about our likes and dislikes and the chef put together 10 courses based on what we most delight us. Every course was outstanding and out did the last one. It was a wonderful experience and we will definitely return."
,,,,,"In a pandemic, there is takeout omakase!! It's still divine. It came with dessert and a bottle of wine too. Packaging: Every item perfectly snugged in to safely drive it (all the way back to the suburbs). They even packed it according to temperature, so nothing hot was pressed against anything cold. Omakase items: Still gorgeous. Only one thing was substituted. Unfortunately it was the thing I was most looking forward to; The impetus to try this takeout  --it was scallops. Murphy's Law. There was nothing lesser in quality, plating, or portion. I loved it. And, like the dine-in experience of an Uchi omakase, I still oooo'd and ahhh'd. Price: Their takeout omakase is probably the safest way to experience an omakase --financially. All prix fixe, not a range. No, 'Surprise!' Lol. Dining-in omakase is within a price range. Dessert: At the time mine was to assemble at home with easy directions. Mine wasn't pretty, was exotic in combination of flavors and textures, and wasn't for me. Wine: Admittedly, three months later I have yet to open it. It's just that my pandemic pod has been imbibing cocktails and champagne sometimes the whole duration of my visit. I gotta pace."
,,,,,Five stars for my omakase experience six months ago.
,,,,,"I have a cousin who eats sushi 3-4 week. We made plans for the omakase two months before, because I wanted to make sure my outside financial obligations were securely covered.  In that wait time, we excitedly researched omakase, Uchi, all things sushi, and comparators.  We came to Uchi with great expectations."
,,,,,"Our omakase experience was really amazing. Our great expectations prepared us well, actually. We were ready for our eyes to dance, and our mouth to savor. We ooh'd and aah'd at every presentation and every mouthful. There was lots of wordless communication. Lots of exultation. It was almost like our table was an altar receiving the best things that result from hard, but smart study. There were surprising twists to combinations, and so tastes. The way great live music can unfold and occupy your body, every part of our omakase did too. Omakase is an event here.  Very quickly it became apparent we took relatively long in the pleasures on our palate, that they had to slow the parade for us. We didn't care, and they did let us know they will follow our pace."
,,,,,My omakase experience needs to be on your bucket list.
,,,,,"I say it this way because a few months later my other cousin took his wife here. I only saw their receipt with the descriptions of their sushi parade. To me, it was mostly unexciting and I was turned off that would happen for their experience (and anyone's at Uchi). --Please note that cousin and his wife enjoyed their experience. Also, pls note that their experience stayed well within the generally predicted price range, whereas mine was off by an additional $100 (to the generally predicted price range). Luckily I was prepared, but it was a down note ending to an otherwise paradigm blowing experience of what raw fish plates can aspire to be on earth."
,,,,,"I have mixed feelings about the contrasting experiences. I am glad I had my experience. Going to the trouble of a good reservation at Uchi, and omakase, I want my palate entertained by high creativity, inspiration and aspiration, in addition, of course, to quality. However, even though cousin w wife had a bill that stayed right on the generally predicted price range, I think if I had that experience I would have felt my checklist was done, but not necessarily a full adventure completed."
,,,,,"Cons of my evening: 1. There is no separate line for people with reservations. I was in line with the happy hour people, and people with no reservations 2. Lots of white staff stylized to look Asian, or rather EurAsian. This does not feel good, and it's a bit creepy 3. While I was asking the hostess 3 questions, a guy at the back of the line decided his happy hour was urgent and he needed to interrupt my place in line and dialogue with the hostess. After he finished asking his questions, I very loudly told him, ""You're really rude. I was speaking with her and you interrupted."" While the line bristled, I did refrain from adding, ""So was it your sexism or racism that you decided to interrupt me?"" ...He turned bright red and mumbled an apology. I noticed that the hostess' automatic reaction was to furrow her eyes in my direction. I furrowed mine right back. After a pause, she apologized for that interruption several times. At a point, I decided she seemed genuine in effort of taking onus. Of course, I acknowledged it was not her fault."
,,,,,"The food was fresh and the atmosphere was great! Great place to try new things! As someone who is a sushi lover, the waitress were thrilled to make our experience educational and fun."
,,,,,"Uchi is a vegetarian's holy grail!! Not a huge brussel sprouts girl but theirs are out of the world. I will be ordering these every time I go. Veggie Yokai was a great unique refreshing take for my palette. Nasu Nigiri, Chef's Vegetarian Roll, and Pitchfork in that order with the eggplant being my favorite. Celebrated my friend's birthday and every time a waiter(ess) came by they wished her- so sweet and inviting! The Jasmine Cream dessert was a yummy and magical way to end the night. Perfect place to come to celebrate special occasions with family and friends."
,,,,,Wonderful options. Unfortunately I believe the establishment obtained an extremely confident attitude since recognition of being one of the beat restaurants listed for Houston. 
,,,,,-Amazing pairings
,,,,,-Mediocre but not extremely exotic infusions of flavor
,,,,,-Extremely disappointing proportions
,,,,,-Price point is beyond the combination of proportion & creativity.

,,,,,"Their food was absolutely stunning. Beyond my expectations. Service was great, except the fact that the server entered the wrong amount of bill so we got overcharged. We reached out to the restaurant, but they said they had to submit the investigation to the administration and we still haven't heard back from them."
,,,,,A love letter....
,,,,,Uchi....I have said it before and Im saying it again. You are my #1 always and forever. I have dined here at least 1/month for the last 5 years...Im not even kidding. I bring every friend and family member here to witness the magic of your omakase. I am sad COVID has separated us for the time being but as soon as this pandemic slows down I am coming for you! My favorite is EVERYTHING. I am not even kidding. I dont think I have had one thing that I disliked. I trust you and I love you and you have never led me astray. Thank you for the good times and best times. See you soon....

,,,,,Very interesting flavors! Make sure to reserve because it is reservation only. Ordered their happy hour menu but still wasn't full.
,,,,,Let me start with this: I'm a VERY particular person who  (silently) notices every little flaw in details or taste.  
,,,,,"I've been here 3 times and have 0 complaints about taste, but I do have 1 thing I'd like to bitch about - the fact that I can't eat here every freaking day!! "
,,,,,"Big thanks to the staff for making our experience (my birthday dinner) so enjoyable, especially amidst all of this COVID crap ."
,,,,,one of my favorite restaurants in HTX. happy is great and everything in the menu is worth trying at least once.
,,,,,"WHAT. In. The. World. After years of hearing all kinds of glowing reviews, I finally had my first Uchi experience last night. Since then, I've thought more than once about my meal, and I honestly am at a loss for words to sufficiently convey how amazing everything was. Everything. Start to finish, including the valet guy. "
,,,,,I don't even understand how these people use mostly simple ingredients and marry flavors together in such beautiful ways to make interesting dishes that are somehow also almost universally accessible to any palate or preference. These people are freaking sushi magicians. There's no other explanation. It doesn't even make sense. 
,,,,,"My husband and I traditionally have a knock-down-drag-out-year-end-date-night, which is how we ended up here last night. In classic 2020-COVID fashion, we arrived to this meal mentally and physically exhausted from the week and had zero desire to make any decisions. Thankfully, we had the good fortune of Aziz being our server and he took care of everything. We sat back and he had plate after delicious plate sent out to our table with perfect timing. We had flounder. We had 72 hour short ribs (twice, actually). We had Walu Walu. I don't even know what Walu Walu is, but holy mackerel it was amazing. Even Uchi's basic sushi rolls are unbelievably good. Each delivery to our table had a simple, comprehensive explanation for how to eat each dish to maximize the flavor. ""Pinch this with two fingers and eat with the protein facing your tongue."" ""Be sure to get a slice of orange with each slice of Ahi."" ""The foie gras is on the rich side, so we'll send this one out close to dessert."" I've eaten some good food in my life, but never have I watched a restaurant staff work in such perfect harmony to ensure my entire dining experience was as pleasant and enjoyable as possible. It was truly something special to witness and to experience. "
,,,,,"On the topic of COVID, I was particularly impressed with how Uchi has been able to adapt to a socially-distanced, safe dining experience without it feeling sterile or uncomfortable. The front desk did an incredible job of communicating with us in advance of our reservation to explain the protocol for arrival. There are undoubtedly less tables in the dining room than there were pre-COVID, but it doesn't feel empty or odd inside. It's a warm, intimate dining experience without the anxiety of dining too close to strangers. "
,,,,,"For anyone who has not yet had the pleasure of a visit to Uchi, I can't possibly recommend it enough. You may have to make a reservation well in advance to get in, but you will not be disappointed."
,,,,,Lol I'm from california and this was the best sushi EXPERIENCE of my life. Every bite was amazing
,,,,,Wait is Uchi a cult?  Anyways pretty bussin exept for when it got slimy. anywasy daped it up and still ate it
,,,,,"Great spot in the Montrose area. My friends and I go here. The ambiance is great and the food is amazing. This place is always busy, so you may want to make reservations. The service is fast and the waiters are great at helping you to pick out good items on the menu based on your preferences, so be sure to ask if you have questions."
,,,,,"I would say this place is great for all occasions such as birthdays, friends hanging out, family meals, business meetings, etc. A really nice place and the food is unique."
,,,,,Holy Jesus. If you're a vegetarian this place is a must. They have a vegetarian tasting menu and literally each plate was better than the one before. I want to move in and eat only this for the rest of my life.

,,,,,"How have I never reviewed Uchi!  I love it SO much!!!  We recently had their omakase for 2 & picked it up via curbside pickup.. the pickup experience was very smooth.  You book a pickup time online & they call you to take your order.  When I arrived there was someone in the parking lot checking us in & directing everyone to a parking spot.  I waited maybe 10 min for the food to arrive.  The food itself was amazing, as always!"
,,,,,"Literally the best food I've ever had as well as hands down the best service!! It was an amazing experience overall. We let our waitress pick some of the chefs favorites and got about 10 different plates between my husband and I. There wasn't a single dish we didn't fall in love with, haha! Thanks so much Uchi!!"
,,,,,"I couldn't help but be disappointed by my experience at Uchi. After hearing so much about it from my friends, I have to say that it didn't live up to the expectations."
,,,,,"We lined up at around 4:15 PM for opening time at 5:00 and there was already a line in front of us. The line definitely got pretty long as we waited, so come early to eat. There's decent street parking in the area."
,,,,,"The food was good, but so expensive and the portion sizes were very small. We got the vegetarian omukase (one of our friends was vegetarian), as well as different rolls. It was so pricy, but the bigger issue is that all of us left hungry. We actually went to Velvet Taco across the street afterwards. The service was also exceedingly slow as we sat down at 5, and left at almost 8. The service was very friendly and accommodating but just very slow."
,,,,,"Overall, not impressed. I don't think I'd come to Uchi again (maybe if someone else was paying), but I would probably check out another sushi place in the area rather than here."
,,,,,I love this place. 
,,,,,"Shaggy dog - very different than traditional places, but amazing flavor, crispy exterior. Burst of flavor. "
,,,,,All cooked items on the menu - everyone rated them a 10/10. Especially the fried/cooked chicken that is served in a box. Everyone seemed to enjoy the best. 
,,,,,Fish was fresh and so perfect. Can not complain! Must try!
,,,,,"This is the absolute best place for omakase, the chefs tasting. Their happy hour was a great deal as well so we did both and were very satisfied by the end of the evening. We made a reservation and it was an ease arriving - the service was impeccable. "
,,,,,"Everything they brought was beautifully crafted and delicious. There was a balance of entree type dishes and nigiri. Omakase came out to be $113 each for 10+ tastings. Well worth it. We found a new one to add to our favorite fish list: Sawara (Japanese Spanish mackerel). The otoro lived up to all our standard and even the dessert was outstanding. From the social hour, must get walu walu, eggplant nigiri and oysters. "
,,,,,You really do have to try it for yourself.
,,,,,"If you ever are in town and are searching for a unique Traditional Japanese sushi restaurant, Uchi is your dream spot. Each and every one of their plates were filled with astounding flavors and mouth-watering texture. I can tell the chef takes delicacy and aesthetics on the plate for serious. You will not be disappointed, for sure! "
,,,,,"I completely forgot to let ""my phone eat first"" prior to digging in myself but here are my recommendations:"
,,,,,FISH plates 
,,,,,1. Zero sen roll (salmon and tuna with a sweet soy sauce and a ~smoky~ after-taste)
,,,,,2. Sake Namida (garlicky; tuna and salmon) 
,,,,,"3. Social Veggie Cure (yuca fries with avocado, golden raisins, and almonds)"
,,,,,4. Ocean trout
,,,,,STEAK plates
,,,,,"5. Social Short Short Rib (from someone like myself who does not like ribs, the way these ribs were cooked made them immediately melt in your mouth at the first touch of your taste buds!)"
,,,,,6. Social Pork belly - SO DAYUM DELICIOUS. 
,,,,,EXTRAS
,,,,,"7. For avocado lovers, their 2pc avocado is great. The lemony flavor makes your taste buds fall in love! "
,,,,,"8. Social veggie yoga - these are just so yummy. Yes, they are fried, but the tomato and chimchurra sauce makes the texture go to the MOON."
,,,,,9. Social uchi salad - this is basically like a salad wrap with jicama inside in midst of a green wasabi-avocado sauce.
,,,,,10. Charred Edaname. No more can be said. 
,,,,,"Location is quite nice, especially for Houston. The waiters and waitresses were all super friendly and I can tell they know the menu inside-out. Every time I come, Uchi has never failed me or my family in satisfying our stomachs and taste buds."
,,,,,High end restaurant chains rarely do work and this sushi establishment is no exception. It's like paying for a Beyoncé concert and getting the backup singers. The food was ok and the service was inconsistent (a btl of wine arrived at the end of the meal). Yelpers love it more than teddy bears... so may have to give it another chance.
,,,,,parking was valet only i believe. food was alright -- sushi quality was good but my favorite was the foie gras and fried milk dessert
,,,,,"Came here to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. We had a great time. Our server Matt made excellent suggestions when we asked him for recommendations. Also, it was our first time here and never did any of the staff made us feel ""strange"" (that pretentious vibe workers at upscale restaurants give off sometimes when you dk how something works). On the contrary, every staff member took the time to explain to us what we were eating  and how to eat it. We appreciated that very much! This restaurant is on the pricier side but I didn't even mind the bill in exchange for such a fantastic culinary experience and service. Keep up the great work!"

,,,,,"The best Japanese dining experience I've ever had! What was supposed to be a quick happy hour trip turned into a mini dinner because we just couldn't stop ourselves - a 3-4 course trip ended up including 10! The best part was that we didn't even pick most of our items - that was all on our amazing server Matt. Each of his picks were incredible and are things I would love to eat again. The unique twists on a lot of the dishes, from their pickled wasabi to different elements of crunchy/sweet/sour/etc, were perfect. Each dish added more and more to our experience. It's really hard to pick a favorite, but the Bluefin Flight, Walu Walu, and Hama Chili were notably great. Between Matt's awesome service, the really chill/fun vibes, and the next level food, I can't wait to come back again."
,,,,,"I haven't been to the restaurant in person yet but ordered takeout as a birthday celebration.  I had always had this bias that Uchi was just another overrated sushi place where you're paying more for ""brand"" and ambience than the food. I stand corrected. The food was absolutely amazing. The fish was so soft, the right warmth level, and flavorful. The wasabi they placed on the rice (nigiri) was subtle but added a lot of flavor to the nigiri. The (I'm assuming) yuzu paste they added to the top of the scallop nigiri was so flavorful and really brought out the sweetness of the scallop."
,,,,,It is pricey though considering what your $$ gets in terms of quantity. I was left feeling a little hungry even though we spent $200+ (for 2 people) BUT the flavor of the fish/dishes made worth it. I basically loved every fish/scallop nigiri and/or dish in the attached pictures. 
,,,,,"If it was this good as takeout, I bet it's even better dine in! Would highly recommend this place and I heard the happy hour is more bang for your buck which is definitely something I'll be checking out in a couple months."
,,,,,love their croissant.   cheese stuffed.
,,,,,staff are quick. like to bring my gf here for breakfast . 
,,,,,uchi is Oishi (delicious).
,,,,,"Uchi has always been our go to for those special evenings, birthdays or anniversary. This time, it was for anniversary, where we ordered take out (we would never do that, but for Covid), and to no surprise, we thoroughly enjoyed the food. We are vegetarians and Uchi has always amazed is with their evolving veg menu. Though got take out the selection was limited, which I understand because they don't want to compromise on quality or experience. We could not order some of our favorites but shout out to Jessica, who helped us with the selection and portions, and made sure our experience was amazing. "
,,,,,"Been going to Uchi for 8 years and they just keep surpassing our expectations. Kudos to the team for the food, service and customer satisfaction."
,,,,,"Hot spot in Houston, full at 5:00pm, unbelievable! The service is super, very friendly, very knowledgeable! The food quality and presentation is very clean and cool , food is delicious! Can be one of my favorite restaurant restaurants!"
,,,,,Outstanding food in the most special of places to celebrate anything or nothing at all. Very casual atmosphere (I wore athletic clothes) but food really is off the charts. I was especially impressed by the vegetarian menu that was fairly large and very interesting. I also loved the fish and other items on the main menu. Highly recommend.
,,,,,It was amazing! We did the signature Omakase menu and it was truly one of the best meals of my life. Each dish was an exquisite and the service was fantastic.
,,,,,"Been here a few times now. Food and service are always excellent. Reservations recommended. The menu can be overwhelming as there's a lot to choose from, and if you are not familiar with Japanese cuisine/terms, but still don't worry there is a great knowledgeable staff who will describe to you everything and will help you to order what your there for. What I had there, everything was amazing and will prepared. Environment was clean and I felt so safe while eating there."
,,,,,"Is there a 6star option? I come to Houston every so often to visit family, and coming to Uchi is a must do every time. It's hands down the best sushi I've ever had. Every dish they serve is amazing. This is not a restaurant where you get big portions and it is upscale. But my greatest tip is HAPPY HOUR. It's more reasonably priced, you can try so much more with your table (everything is about one bite/ sharable). You won't regret anything you order (especially if you order the Brussel sprouts). I can't say enough good things about this place. It's an experience that everyone should do at least once."
,,,,,"fire..... don't ever sleep on the best sushi dining experience in Houston, TX quite possible the country..."

,,,,,This is by far the best restaurant I've been to in Houston!  So good I had to go twice during my short trip.  Everything here is fresh and phenomenal and the happy hour menu offers a great way to introduce people to these outstanding dishes in a less expensive price point.  Coming from NY I can say that this is a standout spot that reminds me of many of the places in the big Apple....except we would be paying double or triple the price.  
,,,,,"The staff here is warm, kind and funny...wish I  remembered their names but I would request the same two servers over and over if I could.  They even brought us out a dish on the house as we were celebrating an engagement.  I wish I could make friends with someone here so I can get a reservation whenever I wanted.  I'd book a flight instantly just to eat here and fly back!"
,,,,,Murderpoint oysters (10/10)were so good. So good!! Only $2 during sake social 
,,,,,Yakai berry (10/10): so good. Light and refreshing 
,,,,,"Hama chili (10/10) a classic and must have. Again you should order 2. It's really good. Yellowtail, ponzu, actual Thai chilis (spicccy), orange and purple basil. "
,,,,,Yuca frites (7/10): nice little snack. 
,,,,,"PORK BELLY(10/10): egg jam, atchara, crispy rice. Very filling. I like how the crispy rice is on top of the meat, so the rice doesn't get soaked. "
,,,,,AVOCADO MAKIMONO (10/10): one of the best rolls we had tonight. 
,,,,,Negi Hama futomaki (5/10): just okay. 
,,,,,Spicy sake maki (8/10): I liked this as well
,,,,,"NASU NIGIRI (10/10): eat hot and omg wow. I loved all of the components. Eggplant, lemon curd, Goma shio "
,,,,,FOIE GUNKAN (10/10): candied quinoa. Fish caramel. Shiso. Omg sooo goood!!! 
,,,,,Toyosu selection (7/10): yellowtail was the special tonight. 
,,,,,Brussel spouts: good as always. 
,,,,,Ham and eggs (6/10): my husband liked this. I did not. Too much mayo for me. 
,,,,,Hamachi nigiri (7/10): I liked this one very good
,,,,,Zero sen (10/10): this was so good. The sauce was a sesame paste and oil mix which complimented the sushi roll really well. 
,,,,,Fried milk (10/10): most popular and favorite dessert
,,,,,Coconut Tapioca (7/10): very light and refreshing the hazelnut gives it some crunch.
,,,,,"Happy hour. Amazing. It was so refreshing to see staff members working together as a TEAM and functioning like one big well-oiled machine. Honestly, it was nice to see that everyone's role helped to make the customers experience worthwhile. I was so impressed by this. If I were the owners I would be proud. I wish that more restaurants and hotels had this quality of customer care and service (A+++). "
,,,,,Any makimonos (sushi rolls): 
,,,,,avo maki with wagyu: meh 
,,,,,Spicy crunchy tuna: was good but better at other sushi places 
,,,,,Negi Hama futomaki: good fish. But unremarkable. 
,,,,,This is not a location where you should order sushi rolls. They were.. underwhelming. Don't waste your money on rolls. (0/5) try NOBU for sushi rolls. 
,,,,,HAPPY HOUR SOCIAL MENU BELOW
,,,,,Shiro tora: I liked this. There was a little bit of spice and the first bite had a lot of flavor. The salmon was perfect and the curry tomato and sauce were so so good. 
,,,,,"Machi cure: ORDER THIS. DOES NOT DISAPPOINT.  Fuck it; order 2. And proceed to inhale. Smoked yellowtail, yucca crisp, marcona almonds. Amazing. Life changing.  TAKE MY MONEY"
,,,,,Buta abura kasu: meh. I remember forcing myself to eat this. I felt like I was eating a bunless burger patty. 
,,,,,"Walu walu: the candied citrus, ponzu sauce compliment the oak grilled Escobar. It was perfection. "
,,,,,"Nasu nigiri: Japanese grilled eggplant, with lemon curd and Goma shio (spinach). I really liked this one. "
,,,,,"Ebi diru: served cold. Shrimp, a lot of white sauce and dill. Did not like. "
,,,,,"Gyu kare: omg this was so good. If you are a meats person; you would like this short rib, sunchoke, and curry."
,,,,,DAILY SPECIALS MENU
,,,,,Ham and eggs: I thought this was disgusting. It's a roll. So.. avoid ordering this. 
,,,,,"Koka bito sake: My husband said this was missing flavor. My brain said food meet mouth. Comes with Beet cured salmon, corn, Fresno. "
,,,,,"Buta mekyabetsu: grilled Pork belly, corn, Brussels sprouts. Having the pork belly grilled makes a HUGE difference. It's the best way to Cook pork belly. YUMMMMMMMMMMMMx10 "
,,,,,"Ahiru: duck, Fargo, apricot, cilantro: one of our top dishes. "
,,,,,"Kohitsuji: lamb, bonito, potato, olive. Would not order again. "
,,,,,REGULAR MENU
,,,,,"Hama chili: order 2. Going by yourself? Order 2. Yellowtail, ponzu sauce, Thai chili, orange supreme. So grateful to have this in my city.  "
,,,,,Brussels sprouts: lemon and chili. Delicious. The Brussels sprouts are roasted and there's a wonderful refreshing flavor. 
,,,,,Suggestions-- make a reservation. complimentary valet: do it if it's hot outside or you're at terrible parking. order during happy hour. ORDER DURING HAPPY HOUR. Ask the hostess for Oscar as your server. Don't order more than 12 selections.
,,,,,"This is a review specifically for the curbside pick-up Vegetarian Dinner for Two, which carries a lofty $75 price tag. Excellent value without question, however, as the experience includes 7 small-ish meatless courses, a pint of seasonal sorbet, a bottle of wine, and an extra DIY dessert. "
,,,,,"Overall, the appetizers were tasty and contained some surprises, though only one or two were genuinely memorable. The Veggie Mushi was an absolute flavor bomb of sweet, spicy, and sour in the vein of a Thai Tom Kha soup. The Kinoko Usuzukari (thinly sliced mushrooms) is essentially an interesting vegetarian take on a delicate crudo; the vinegary and umami notes are delivered via fine sheets of spongy fungi topped with shallots. The copious charred and salty edamame were a nice filler course. The Brussel Sprouts with lemon and chili were decent, but the original Uchi sprouts with caramelized fish sauce are leaps and bounds better. The Miso Soup was unremarkable. "
,,,,,"Among the choices for mains, we went for the Pitchfork Maki, a whirlwind of complimentary textures between crunchy shallots, crisp shishito, and buttery avocado, and a welcome zap of citrusy heat from a bright yuzu kosho blend. The Bok Choy was OK, but the cashew butter and lime-tomato salad stole the show. "
,,,,,"At this point, we were content but not stuffed. But our palates were fairly saturated from the onslaught of colorful and savory courses. The simple and refreshing summery strawberry-apricot sorbet with a crunchy butter crumble really hit the spot. The final throw-in was a savory miso-pecan bread pudding, which soaks overnight and goes in the oven for 20 minutes before getting the maple caramel sauce treatment. Crazy decadent and maybe could've used more sweet and less savory, but no complaints otherwise. "
,,,,,"We enjoyed the meal and felt it was appropriately priced, but it fell short of truly wowing us."
,,,,,"Since opening, this outshoot of the beloved Austin restaurant has become a culinary Mecca for locals, celebrities, critics, and everyone in between. Situated in a star-studded stretch of Westheimer, the building is low-key and there's complimentary valet out back. The inside is moody and elegant, from the antechamber made from stacked wooden planks, to the ""bar"" where you can watch master sushi chefs at work, to private and communal seating areas. It is notoriously difficult to get reservations, so either plan ahead or avoid peak hours. For more budget conscious individuals, there is a Sake Social each day from 5:00-6:30 PM where you can sample some of their most popular courses at a smaller scale (and cost) along with cheap beer and sake. There is typically a line, so make sure all members of your party are present as close to 5:00 as possible."
,,,,,"While renowned for incredible sushi and sashimi, Uchi's menu has much more to offer in the form of hot and cool ""tastings"" as well as larger courses. The cuisine is far from traditional Japanese, opting for an avant-garde approach to classic ingredients and preparations. You truly cannot go wrong. The dishes are consistently surprising, beautifully arranged, and incorporate the freshest of ingredients in unique ways.  Here are my recommendations:"
,,,,,"Uchiviche - Arguably my favorite offering on the menu, it's basically Chef Cole's take on ceviche. A refreshing mix of salmon and bass marinated in lime juice, golden cherry tomatoes, and bell pepper topped with cilantro. Sliced chilies give the mouthwatering dish a crisp finish."
,,,,,"Machi Cure - Buttery smoked yellowtail, wavy yucca chips, almonds, and juicy slices of pear. This dish is an explosion of flavor and texture. Use the crisps to get a little bit of everything in each bite. "
,,,,,"Walu Walu - Grilled escolar with a beautiful sweet ginger-soy glaze poured over top. The fish itself has a very distinct taste that is accentuated by the citrus. Funny note: humans can't digest the wax coat of escolar properly, and it can act as a laxative in large quantities. So as tempting as it may be, don't order more than a few of these!"
,,,,,"Bacon Otoshi - I find it hard to resist the seafood dishes, so I often have to remind myself that Uchi has some exceptional meat options as well. Case in point, this astonishing savory mix of fatty pork belly, onions, and jalapeños drizzled in an orange kimchi sauce. Normally kimchi is not my cup of tea, but this version was tart and piquant. Doesn't hurt when the pork melts in your mouth either."
,,,,,"Fried Milk - It's an utter travesty if you dine here and don't order at least one. This is a whimsical re-imaging of breakfast, with little cornflake-crusted pouches filled with milky custard, velvety mousse, and milk sherbet. Definitely in the running for my favorite all-time dessert."
,,,,,"The nigiri and sashimi are to die for. The uni (sea urchin) disintegrates into briny nectar on your tongue, the unagi (eel) is soft and sweet, and the hotate (scallop) is delicate and smooth. I anxiously await the day I can reasonably afford the omakase, the multi-course chef's tasting. The servers are very knowledgeable about the dishes, although they can sometimes come across as hurried and robotic. Uchi definitely runs like a well-oiled machine when it's busy. Take your time and savor every bite!"
,,,,,"Update: Get the avocado nigiri with lemon-miso glaze. Don't ask questions, just trust me. The chef's special nigiri is also the way to go if you want to try a variety of extraordinary sushi. It comes with 5 hand-selected pieces that can include things like sea bream, barracuda, salmon belly, roe (with a shot of quail egg), and more. Make sure to eat with your fingers and turn each bite so the fish hits your tongue first!"
,,,,,"Hands down the best sushi experience and fish. You get what you pay for and this is here. Picture of ""Old Skool"" highly recommend."
,,,,,Everything is stupendous in presentation and flavor.  But you will be hungry after eating so bring a big wallet and order twice as much as you think.
,,,,,"We've been to Uchi 10+ times and we've had a fabulous experience every time! Be sure to make a reservation. I love the ambiance inside and it's a perfect date night spot. Their menu is fantastic and they also offer a happy hour from 4-6:30.  All of the fish is very high quality and tastes amazing. I love the creativity behind their dishes. Also, their wine list in amazing! As a wine nerd, I really appreciate the selections. They also have sake and beer and sake cocktails. It's an incredible place all around. We always have great service!"
,,,,,Great food and the hospitality was michelin-star comparable.
,,,,,"If you appreciate the detail in food, you'll have a fun time here."
,,,,,"My favorite restaurant in the US hands down. The hama chili, otoro, foie gras, alaska king crab... just to name a few... amazing!"
,,,,,"Uchi turns out to be a great place for splurge, or in my case an anniversary dinner with the wife. I was caught of guard with just how busy this little place is. We booked almost a week early for a Tuesday reservation and all we could get was a 4 o'clock seating. Wow!!!"
,,,,,"Free valet parking is available in a new office building across the street. Also, we were contacted several times by the restaurant to make sure we were actually coming and would be on time! (On Tuesdays they open at 4. We and several others were waiting outside a few minutes early. At exactly 4, and not a minute earlier, they opened the doors.)"
,,,,,"Still it turned out great. We ordered the 10 course omakase and Uchi did not disappoint. They gave us a choice of vegetarian (if you want that) and the 10 and 8 course omakase. Of course we took the 10 course. We selected a 50-50 split of raw and cooked selections. Since it was our anniversary, they actually slipped in an 11th item - so thanks for that."
,,,,,I would be hard pressed to chose my favorite course. The quality of the fish and ingredients was faultless. I really appreciated the traditional Japanese style blended with unique and modern seasoning. Brilliant.
,,,,,"The recommended Italian light red wine was an excellent pairing and went well with the meal.  Including the wine, the tab was a bit over $300 plus tip. A great special occasion meal."
,,,,,"Simply some of the best and most creative food I have had in Houston. We ordered about 8-10 items from the menu and were not disappointed in any dish. Our server's recommendations shined. And yes, the fried milk dessert is actually that good."

,,,,,"Although the sushi was exquisite, I wouldn't come here unless it were a very special occasion. Even sake social (happy hour) will leave a huge hole in your wallet, and you'll have to order a lot of items off the menu to satisfy your appetite if you come hungry because the sushi typically comes with only 3-4 per dish. We probably ordered the entire menu on accident lol. I did looove the ambience inside though."
,,,,,"My favorites were the pork belly (not pictured), walu walu, flounder, and fried milk (thank you to the waiter for this recommendation--I had high expectations based on his hype, and they were actually delivered)."
,,,,,This was our first time at Uchi after living in Houston for eight years. So glad we tried it before moving away because the entire dining experience was certainly worth it. The staff were very friendly and generous to celebrate our graduation and even gave us a complimentary item. Make sure to cross this one off the bucket list!!!
,,,,,"This review was for March 23,2021. Came in for our anniversary dinner and we loved Uchi! "
,,,,,Servers were all very attentive and very professional. 
,,,,,Food was fresh and outstanding !! We love the flavor profile and plating technique and seasonal. Definitely will come back for more!
,,,,,"I don't know why it took me so long to try this place but I'm glad I finally had the opportunity! First and foremost the staff were very professional in welcoming us, and our server Hudson was so helpful! He asked if it was our first time at Uchi (which it was) and went through the whole menu with us with such ease. If he didn't do that, I don't think I'd know what I'd be ordering lol. "
,,,,,"We ordered machi cure, Wagyu hot rock, karaage, chef's 5 nigiri selection, gyutoro nigiri, avocado nigiri, and masu nigiri. Machi cure was a great blend of smoky and nutty flavors. The yellowtail was yummy. I was slightly disappointed in the hot rock because the meat wasn't super tender but it was a good experience. Karaage was good fried chicken but I don't think I'll order it again; it wasn't anything special. The nigiri was where it was at!! I've heard a lot of raves about the avocado and masu, and I'm glad I ordered both. My boyfriend hates avocado and any vegetables/fruit but he really enjoyed those items here. They were so soft and melt-in-your-mouth. The gyutoro is described as a 72-hour short rib. Also melted in our mouths, so good! The 5 piece nigiri selection was also very tasty. We ate it up so fast! "
,,,,,"Last but not least, we got fried milk for dessert, which was my favorite part of the dinner. Ugh... it was so delicious!! The fried milk ball was unlike anything I've ever had for dessert. With the chocolate and ice cream, everything went so well together. "
,,,,,Trust that I will be back for more!
,,,,,"Worth every penny. The experience was amazing! My group and I did a little informal omakase that we let our server curate for us. I'm usually a creature of habit but he made some amazing choices! I loved everything. He definitely got us things I would've never even thought of ordering. Everything was so good, I didn't even get any pictures besides this amazing dessert! I can't remember what it was called but it was amazing."
,,,,,"This place was absolutely phenomenal! From the service to the food, everything was just fantastic."
,,,,,We made reservations for a Saturday evening and our waiter (Jon) was just incredible. He did a whole TikTok dance for my family over a Duo call. We had one of every dessert and the food was just delectable in every possible way.
,,,,,"My favorite was the sake namida (which unfortunately I wasn't able to get a picture of - as we devoured it immediately). I ordered the hot rock and the sake salmon sashimi which was phenomenal. The only thing I could possibly say that wasn't all that wonderful, was probably that the hot rock wasn't hot enough to cook my meat, but as soon there was mention of it, it was immediately replaced. So all is well."
,,,,,"Jon suggested that we get one order of every dessert and my favorite would probably have to be the Fried Milk. The concept really baffles me, but man was it good on my tongue. I absolutely enjoyed it so much. Thank you Jon for the recommendation because now I was able to try one of every dessert."
,,,,,"Great restaurant, awful to go boxes. Food and drinks are absolutely amazing, would recommend Brussels sprouts, wagyu, and yuzu fish. If you're taking food to go though, be warned that none of the lids fit on the boxes so things spill everywhere. Had to learn that the hard way..."
,,,,,We made a last minute reservation on a weeknight and they accommodated us perfectly. We arrived 20 minutes early and were surprised with no wait time! 
,,,,,"Menu isn't very expansive, but all of the items are creative and unique. Service was friendly and  informative. We will definitely be back!"
,,,,,"I decided to check out this place and Kata Robata, 'cos I was really missing sushi. Uchi was recommended to me by another Angeleno and he was spot on. This is definitely the best sushi place in Houston. Kata Robata was very, like... I dunno... like maybe somewhere around Wokano quality? This was definitely more like a legit sushi place so it's not for sushi tourists but rather people who genuinely enjoy good quality fish and have a nicely refined palate. 10/10 would absolutely fucking eat here again. I'd eat here every day if the bill wasn't $100 a pop by the time I left lol."
,,,,,This place was top notched. Service was A1.
,,,,,Came in for my birthday and every server greeted me a happy birthday. 
,,,,,Everything I loved except the shag. The shag was only okay and there was nothing special about it. Just really filling. 
,,,,,Food was incredible.. definitely can't wait to go back.
,,,,,"Very limited patio seating, but they do offer in door dining as well. "
,,,,,Menu was a bit overwhelming with the amount of selections.  They do offer a vegetarian and a social hour menu as well.  Food was fun and have a southwest take on sushi. 
,,,,,Service was phenomenal and was very helpful at getting us through the menu. Guiding us through their menu.  
,,,,, had a good variety and the foie gras was terrific. Maybe it's bc I forgot how good foie gras is since they banned it in CA.  One other piece that was excellent is the tannin bune (uni w/smoked roe) those are two best pieces. 
,,,,,"Fish was cut and processed well, rice was season well, but a bit dry. Vegetarian sushi was interesting with eggplant, avocado, tomato cut perfectly in size. It wasn't forced and made into an odd shape piece. Knife skills"

,,,,,"For us regular folks uchi is definitely a treat. My husband brought me here to celebrate my birthday. And let me say, he did good because we loved our dinner. I told him that I definitely considered this meal to be the best meal I've had this year. The food was delicious. Our favorite was definitely the foie gras, not something you'd typically think of for sushi but my mouth went to heaven with this dish. My second favorite was the engawa. It was fatty and had an extra umph of flavor from the searing. The staff was so wonderful and helpful. They even prepared an off the menu dish as a gift for my birthday. We went early so that we were able to order off both the happy hour and regular menu. Will definitely be coming back for our next celebration."
,,,,,Amazing flavors and delightfully looking dishes. Great atmosphere and service. Course Tasting is a must to experience a variety of dishes you would normally not order.  Every dish was delicious.
,,,,,"5 stars for the amazing service of our waitress, Angela, and the food here at Uchi Houston. "
,,,,,"My partner and I came in for an early anniversary celebration. Angela seemed incredibly knowledgeable of the menu and created a welcoming atmosphere for us from beginning to end. We were excited for every dish because Angela had a back story for each and every one. She was friendly and attentive, making sure to check on us at the appropriate times. We were even provided complimentary Uchi salad the candy bar on the house. She really made us feel like we were special on our anniversary even though there were other people dining in that night. "
,,,,,"I recommend avoiding the rolls but to definitely try all their sashimi/sushi options if possible. One that really stood out to me was the unagi. I've had unagi in the US and in Japan but Uchi's preparation of the Unagi was my favorite. It was not too sweet, and it seemed like they had torched the top somehow but it was a little crispy so there was a perfect balance of savory/fatty/sweetness that came with the unagi. For the low price as well, it was one of my favorite items of the night."
,,,,,Angela also suggested we tried the fried milk. It's not something I would normally gravitate towards but I had read reviews of it in previously and took the plunge. My partner and I were instantly in love. The outside crust was fried to perfection and all the textures and flavor of the dessert was perfectly balanced and not too sweet. I could have had two or three more servings of this because it was so good. 
,,,,,This is an anniversary dinner to remember and we really have Angela to thank for it. I really recommend Uchi Houston for your special celebration!
,,,,,"My fiancè and I decided to have our anniversary dinner here and we really enjoyed our experience. We ordered the chef's tasting omakase. We also ordered a lycheese and sastsuka cocktails. It was a 10 course meal and we were so stuffed afterwards. Our favorite was the fatty tuna, the pork katsu, and fried milk for dessert. Highly recommended to get this omakase. We paid roughly $300 but it was worth it! "
,,,,,"However, you also have the choice to choose the type of omakase you want and just fill out a form which was cool. Maybe next time we will do that just to be able to try all the other delicious dishes they have. The service was great and thank you Nora for always making sure our table was clean and your hands were clean before taking our picture or serving our food. I know that is something small to recognize in ""normal times""  but it's almost a big deal especially during this pandemic. "
,,,,,"For parking, there is complimentary valet parking at the back if the restaurant. I recommend this place and will definitely come back!"
,,,,,"My favorite place in the whole world, even though it's a Japanese spot it has soooo many yummy delicious vegan options. They never fails to deliver :)))"
,,,,,"Love the daily happy hour here from 4-6pm which features select items from the regular menu for a few dollars off. My favorite dishes are the bluefin otoro, hama chili, pitchfork roll (such great flavors for a vegetarian item), and any wagyu offering. Service is always top notch, and sometimes complimentary items are given which is a nice gesture. Reservations are recommended during busier times, but I can usually snag a table for an early dinner on the weekend. This is the perfect place to satisfy any sushi craving!"
,,,,,"Came here for my birthday and sat outdoors on their patio which fortunately was shaded and had fans (a must in humid, hot Houston weather). Since it was social hour, we practically ordered the whole menu and left feeling way too stuffed but extremely satisfied."
,,,,,"My favorite dishes were yokai berry (so refreshing and light), pitchfork makimono (who knew vegetarian could taste so good), and tempura walu (perfectly battered). Would skip the yuca frites since there are better fried items available to try. "
,,,,,"Service was excellent without being too intrusive, and my waitress even gifted me a sashimi dish for my birthday which was a nice touch. Would definitely be back to try other regular menu items in the future!"
,,,,,"Uchi never disappoints. We've gone many times for happy hour- their happy hour menu is pretty extensive and very good.  We've gone for dinner, and the food and drinks are just as good. The ambiance is hip and modern. They also play some great music. "
,,,,,"When going, I'd suggest doing the meal family style. You'll want to try a lot of different things on the menu. Also, the waitstaff is very knowledgeable about their food and give great recommendations."
,,,,,"Dusty was our waitress and she made excellent suggestions. This is a place where you must try whatever you think you'd like and not be concerned about the prices. There are no spirits to order, only sake, beer and wine. The white wine from New Zealand was great.  This is a must to visit again."
,,,,,honestly worth the hype. you have to come here at least once. this is your sign to treat yourself !
,,,,,spent ~250 for 2 people
,,,,,not exactly sure all of the names bc we got the tasting but here's what i remember

,,,,,king crab 5/5
,,,,,tuna with watermelon 4.5/5
,,,,,mushroom rice bowl 4.4/5
,,,,,uni 4.4/5

,,,,,fried milk 6/5!!!!!
,,,,,"I came here for a double date and it was amazing. Our waiter was funny and brought me a chair for me to place my purse on (after I asked). The food was absolutely amazing and my boyfriend, who never eats sushi, ate it and loved it. We both have sensitive stomachs, so usually we get sick after sushi, but we were both completely fine with no stomach pain. We got the flounder, the piece of salmon, the tuna sashimi, and a few other dishes. The alcohol was also amazing and our waiter knew exactly what to order for us just from us describing what we wanted. I'll definitely be coming back here with my boyfriend. It was the best sushi I've had and had an amazing time with my friends."

,,,,,Uchi has been on my bucket list for YEARS. My boyfriend surprised me with a dinner here for our anniversary. Reservations are super easy to make on their website! 
,,,,,We ended up parking ourselves because there was an open spot nearby and it was raining. The valet man told us to stay in our car until we were contacted that our table was ready. Ended up waiting about 10-15 minutes. 
,,,,,"Since it was our first time, we ordered the omakase, which was around $125/person. I ordered the kara kyuri cocktail, which tasted like fresh, citrusy cucumber water with a spicy kick. Since the dishes were chef's choice, I don't know the exact name of the dishes but every thing tasted amazing! As for dessert, we received the jasmine cream and coconut tapioca. We also ordered the fried milk and we liked this better than the desserts that were offered on the omakase. "
,,,,,Getting omakase at Uchi is truly a great experience and every one should splurge on it at least once in their lifetime. Hopefully we will be back soon to try their happy hour!
,,,,,I really wanted to like this location more than the one in Denver bc I'm from Houston but it seems like being around for a longer time made the restaurant not put as much care into their food as their new spot.. Service was great and fast so no complaints there. 
,,,,,Our two cold plate starters were the Akami te and a gift of a similar dish with hamachi I believe. Both dishes' fish were very fishy and salty. It was hard to tell if it was cured or just not very good fish.. unpleasant nonetheless.. my favorite shag roll was not as lightly fried and thinly crisped as I enjoyed in Denver..
,,,,,"I'm just sad that I love houston food scene more than Denver yet their Uchi is better.. they have full alcohol menu and great cocktails, fresh fish and great sushi chefs. Idk if I will give houston Uchi another try."
,,,,,"Overall, I still had a nice evening out and the food was good; it just didn't dazzle me as much as I expected. My fault for having such high expectations.."
,,,,,We asked our waiter to pick different dishes for us and he did not disappoint! Everything we tasted was prepared perfectly and I highly recommend the Wagyu Hot Rock and their famous Fried Milk Dessert. They also have Sake Social every day from 4-6pm!
,,,,,"I called and asked if there was room at the bar. The hostess told me there were three spots currently available. Within 5 minutes I was at the valet. The valet asked me if I had a reservation. I told him I didn't and that I had just spoke with the hostess. He called the hostess, who told him there was no seating available for at least 1.5 hours. I tried to explain the conversation I had just had with a hostess but he wouldn't listen or park my car. I left and called the restaurant again, but they didn't care or apologize. "
,,,,,"I have been to Uchi and Uchiko in Austin a few dozen times. If you think this compares, it simply doesn't."
,,,,,This has to be one of the best sushi restaurants in Houston. Everytime we come here we leave feeling good. Almost every dish and sashimi is amazing.
,,,,,On this occasion we called last minute and they were able to seat us in an hour and 15 minutes at the sushi bar. This was also our first time being seated there. Its a fun atmosphere to be seated in front of the chefs and see all if the activity behind the sushi bar.
,,,,,So I went with a friend who is vegetarian but will try the fish if it tastes good. He ate everything I ordered and said he would come back to eat all of the same items again.
,,,,,Also for drinks we got some kara kuri's made extra spicy. Amazing sake cocktail.
,,,,,Then we finished off the meal with the fried milk. Can never go wrong with that dessert.
,,,,,I've included pictures of some of the entrees we ordered.
,,,,,I can go back to Uchi weekly if my bank account could handle it.
,,,,,Many many thanks to providing great tasting food and friendly joyful service on my birthday today! I really appreciate Uchi for making this evening an outstanding experience for us. We enjoyed all of the food here and will be back for more as it has definitely lifted my tastebuds with all these great combinations that I really appreciate. All the descriptions really synchronized with the actual taste! Excellent job! Will definitely love to visit again :)
,,,,,"When you decided to dine @ Uchi, prepare to be broke afterwards loll but it's all worth it! Somehow... imo... don't @ me lol"
,,,,,"Service: top notch!! I went ahead and reserved a table for my group beforehand. I called in and asked if we could book a private room. However, it requires a deposit of $800... so it's a no for me lol "
,,,,,"A day before my reservation, manager called and reminded me about their policy: only 2 hour dine in allowed, everyone has to wear masks when not sitting at their tables, reservation could only be hold for 15mins, and complimentary valet parking offered. That was great!"
,,,,,"The day had come. Valet parking service was great. Hostesses were friendly and walked us to our table. Not a fan of our table location but whatever, we're here for the food. Our server was attentive, helpful and knowledgeable. She recommended us lots of good stuff in the menu."
,,,,,"Every dish was brought out with care, thoughtful introduction and a ""bon appetit!"" Wonderful! "
,,,,,Food: 
,,,,,Hot rock: beef melted in your mouth! Ponzu sauce is standard.
,,,,,"Unagi: soft, rich, you can taste the ocean!!"
,,,,,Hamachi: was complimentary from the kitchen! How lovely of them!! Excellent taste!
,,,,,Foie gras: omg mouthwatering! I could taste the caramelized sauce swept on top as well as the charred too!
,,,,,Uni: I saved the best for last!  And boiii I tried to savor every bite of uni! Well there was only 1 bite but I tried to make it last iykyk lollll 
,,,,,"BEST UNI EVERRR!!! It's SO FRESH!! And rich, but still light somehow! I mean you gotta try Uchi once. I didn't regret dine in here. Tho it's super pricey I'm fully aware but it's still worth it imo. "
,,,,,9.5/10
,,,,,"Every plate a masterpiece. Great mix of flavors. Fish so fresh it melts in your mouth like butter. Great service. Timely delivery of each order. Nice happy hour specials. AND complimentary valet parking across the street in the garage. This place is absolute perfection! Also, they have a phenomenal happy hour--servings are cut in half and prices are too so it's a great opportunity to try more things on the menu without breaking the bank or getting stuffed."
,,,,,"The food is always top-notch, even when getting carry out.  In-restaurant, service is excellent...sometimes slow between courses, but if you have that as your mindset (as opposed to go, go, go, as I sometimes find myself), it is quite nice."
,,,,,"Ugh. So mad that Uchi has been on my list to try since moving to Houston, but I JUST got here after 3 years."
,,,,,Literally the BEST sushi I've had in Houston.
,,,,,"The only thing I don't like is that you have to drive down the street for valet. That defeats the safety purpose of valet for women at night as you have to walk down the dark street to get to your car. They do, however, have security that will escort you upon request which is nice. Uchi also validates parking."
,,,,,"Ambiance, service, food all 5 stars."
,,,,,"We let our awesome server choose most of what we ordered: hurame isuzukuri, Brussels, several orders of nasu, zero sen, madai, the fresh toyoso snapper of the day and the hana tataki."
,,,,,Everything was so wonderful. Also had the bartender make mock tails of his own creation that were fab!
,,,,,Already plotting my return next week with bae!

,,,,,I absolutely love uchi and it's somewhat of a hidden gem for me. The food and service is amazing but if you do get seated at the bar just be cautious of the time it may take to prepare your food. It tends to take a little longer which isn't so much of a problem for me but for others it might.  A tip all add is to make reservations as soon as possible do to the limited amount of seating here. Valet is free down the street and not far of a walk. Do also be mindful of panhandling outside the building.
,,,,,"My very first experience was great; our meal felt worth the price. However, the second time around, I felt like they served very generic dishes and very basic selection of fish that I could get at any other sushi restaurant. I will give 2 stars for their dessert and the server Matt. For the price of 1.5 omakase, I would have expected more. Will not be returning to this establishment soon."
,,,,,I love the food. I love the way it's presented and with the sashimi I love the way it's put together. It was our saving grace during the first year of Covid. Thank you.
,,,,,"Love, love, love the sashimi here, the sushi, the beef, and everything els The sashimi is so fresh and clean tasting. I have never ordered anything I didn't love. The wait staff are all knowledgeable and really nice and helpful. If you haven't been, try their happy hour first."
,,,,,"This is my favorite restaurant hands down for over the past year. The food and service is out of this world! I would honestly say this is the best sushi restaurant in Houston. The happy hour is amazing everyday 4-6 with an amazing selection for vegan/vegetarians!! I come here every week, literally. Evy and Nora are excellent servers!! Super kind and loving staff. I bring all my friends and family here and not one person hasn't liked it! YOU WILL LOVE THIS PLACE."
,,,,,I've been a regular to uchi for a while now pretty much going once a week. The atmosphere and food is amazing and real unique find here in Houston. I love bringing in my friends and family and they always love it too. They have an amazing happy hour (social hour) to check out with lots of food and great drinks on there. Uchi also offers an amazing vegetarian menu that is available on the regular and social hour menu. All of the servers are amazing especially my girl E-vy! She's been so helpful since day one and is very kind and knowledgeable of the menu. Thank you so much for everything!
,,,,,"For a restaurant in this price range, we were a little bit disappointed. We went in as a party of four, and we all ordered the tasting menu. We had made a reservation before we went, and the table that we were put on was right next to the front door. People constantly opened and shut the door and two people in our party were blew by the air and it was quite cold in December. For the tasting menu, this was the first restaurant that I've ever been that grouped up four ppl's order into same plate to serve, which was fine with me but the portion in each plate, which was meant to serve four, was really small. Another thing was that we felt very rushy eating as the plates/courses were coming up one after another almost every other minute, except for the last course dessert, which literally took them forever to bring it up. As for the food, they were decent and mostly fusion-style - I would have expected a few more creations. Their fish was very fresh so the sashimis and nigiris were yum. I would recommend the cold dishes from this place than the hot ones."
,,,,,Hello Yulu H. 
,,,,,"Thank you for taking the time to leave us this feedback. I am very sorry for the table you got sat in. I deeply apologize for that, this is no way to enjoy dinner. Our guest typically enjoy our course pace, our menu is large so at this pace you can enjoy most if not all the menu. However I see that this style is not for you, I totally understand. My name is Jesse Regalado, I am a manager here at Uchi. I would like to leave you my number (832) 797-2199. Please let me make your next reservation so I can tailor a meal for you. I can make sure the pace is slowed down and you have a warm table to sit at! I will also make a few course recommendations that I am sure will be amazing for y'all."
,,,,,"TL;DR: In summary, "
,,,,,"1.) Book an ""omakase"" in advance for a date night."
,,,,,2.) EAT. MOAR. NIGIRI.
,,,,,"3.) Whenever it's available again, eat at the bar."
,,,,,"Uchi will forever remain a part of my memory as it is the first omakase I've ever tried in HTX. Since then, as a couple we've continued coming here and enjoying a grand night out, blessed with the situation that we had almost no clue what we'd be fed--we just knew we were gonna eat GOOD. With omakase their's always one or two dishes you can say ""meh"" to, but in the grand scheme of things, Uchi always delivers quite a show and always knocks it out of the park with their tongue flipping pieces of nigiri. "
,,,,,"Tonight was different and I understand that changes will need to be made due to the pandemic. I mostly miss being able to eat at the bar... There's always something special about being able to see what goes on behind the bar, and anyone else that knows their way around their kitchen can easily appreciate such things--even in silence. "
,,,,,The Pandemic:
,,,,,"We couldn't let one of our favorite spots fizzle out, so before the year ended we wanted to continue supporting Uchi and also redeemed the gift card given out to folks who ordered takeout months ago. Prior to modifications, Uchi was strictly take out only for the first few months following March. Today, tall makeshift plexiglass barriers constructed with wood sit in between booths. Again, no bar seating. The entire bar is plexied to the teeth, as well. "
,,,,,Look & Feel:
,,,,,"The restaurant is quite beautiful using classic architectural elements curiously with a hint of a popular modern/contemporary accents... black Industrial piping with lots of wood. I can't help but stare at the liquid chalk board in the back, and by chance, we always get reservations on the left side away from it, so I'll find my eyes wander towards that direction while waiting on the next dish or if conversation runs dry. "
,,,,,Food:
,,,,,"Their sushi is top notch and their selection is impressive, even in comparison to other high end joints. An experience like this brought me back to a time I tried a Michelin star in New York, but this time each piece has an amazing spin or accent. You know you've stepped into the right restaurant when they don't leave you a bottle of soy sauce at the table. With the omakase you will be met with palette cleansers between dishes and there will be a devised menu in which flavors should build onto each other. For Uchi, I can give a bow to their food. It's nothing short of amazing, but why I can't give it 5-stars is due to some items being inconsistent in quality and sometimes a rather predictable theme for the omakase (fruits and tangerines with everything), and in comparison to other joints, the price tag can be considered quite hefty."
,,,,,"But c'mon dude. I don't care if they're advertising grade 20 wagyu--I probably wouldn't get it again. That hot rock wagyu was a bust, but I admit the novelty factor was a 10-out-of-10; but ponzu sauce for beef...? I guess they were going for something like a 'tataki,' and 4 itsy bitsy pieces that cant fit on a ball of rice...? The cuts felt extremely underwhelming; the wagyu barely had any fat lines and even though we tried very hard to maintain the tenderness & texture while trying to get a good sear, it just didn't deliver.

,,,,,"With the omakase, Uchi aims to please and takes in consideration your critique. If you particularly don't like something, the guys will try to bring you something that will make you happy. "
,,,,,Recommendations:
,,,,,"1.) Tom Kha Gai soup - trust me, I was surprised, too. Who would've thought you'd find the BEST bowl in Houston at a sushi restaurant? Not me. On our second trip back we had to request for it with the omakase and the team accommodated us. That's pretty freakin' cool. "
,,,,,2.) Nigiri sushi - there's just too many to name. I will say they probably have some of the best tuna (of any cut). One of the best bang for buck pieces there is the blue fin akami. 
,,,,,"If you're there for social hour, always get that AND the chef's choice. It sits at $4/pc but the I'm sure the fish rotates based on how much they have in stock or how the chef feels on that particular day, and today they were serving loup de mer--and good God, I had to get another couple pieces after trying it; ontop they accent the fish with a bit of olive oil, a few flakes of kosher salt, and something green (maybe some kind of dill puree?). "
,,,,,I'm always a fan of amberjacks if the restaurant has them. 
,,,,,"Their vegetarian option, eggplant nigiri, I remember was fantastic, but not so amazing this time around. "
,,,,,"3.) Omakase - really, this should be at the top. It's the ultimate foodies' date. Just let the staff take care of you as the chef will often make dishes outside the menu and ask for your honest opinion, so even if you are a regular, you'll still get hit with occasional surprises! Been there three times now for birthdays and anniversaries and they usually kill it. Of course, my favorite part is the nigiri."
,,,,,Hands down the BEST meal I've ever experienced.
,,,,,"Uchi has been on my radar for many years. To be honest, the price point always deterred me from coming as I was afraid of leaving hungry and it just being another overpriced sushi spot. But my first visit proved me soooooo wonderfully wrong. "
,,,,,We made reservations to celebrate my birthday and from the moment I stepped into the restaurant nearly every single person I interacted with made an effort to wish me happy birthday. 
,,,,,"Initially we only wanted to enjoy their Sake Social Happy Hour but our phenomenal server, Sohan, convinced us to go for it and try the 6-course tasting menu. For the price and amount, it seemed incredibly reasonable. BEST DECISION EVER!"
,,,,,"There were some special extra goodies we got to try and I truly shed tears throughout the entire meal. The ambience was warm, cozy, but still maintained the upscale feel that everyone knows and loves to enjoy at Uchi. Almost a biophilic industrial feel. "
,,,,,Fried milk dessert surely impressed as many have told me to try it! My boyfriend thorough enjoyed the WALU WALU and Japanese sea bream nigiri. I loved the kinoko nabe (mushroom crispy rice bowl) and WALU WALU as well! But EVERYTHING TRULY JUST SHINED!!!! Also loved how detailed they were in instructing how to properly enjoy the sushi and allowing you to grab it with your fingers and place fish side down o the tongue and explaining a lot of the thought process of the chefs in building the plates. So dedicated.
,,,,,We have deemed Uchi our anniversary spot because I can't imagine a better experience anywhere else. Sohan you were especially so kind and lovely. 
,,,,,Thank you Uchi Houston! Best birthday dinner ever.
,,,,,Make sure you make reservations 2 to 3 weeks out for this place.  The food and service are always amazing.
,,,,,"Years later and Uchi is still one of my favorite places in Houston. The Ham and Eggs roll is still one of my favorite dishes anywhere. If you go for happy hour, make reservations or come at opening at 4pm to get your name asap on the list."
,,,,,"*1/26/12 UPDATE* - so we went back for a second time this week and with the wonderful Pam as our waitress, everything went perfectly the second time around.  Food came out well-paced and our dinner was under two hours.  Due to space limits, my second review will be more to the point.  For more details on the dishes keep on reading my original review below."
,,,,,Our return meal was as follows:
,,,,,1. machi cure - great light starter again
,,,,,2. bacon tataki = tasty pork belly presentation
,,,,,3. walu walu = tasty again
,,,,,4. pork jowl = yummy again
,,,,,5. sake toro sashimi = I liked the sushi better than sashimi
,,,,,5. BRIE RINGO = YUM YUM AGAIN 
,,,,,6. PITCHFORK ROLL = DELICIOUS I loved the fried leeks and wagyu beef.
,,,,,7. HAM & EGGS ROLL = DELICIOUS AGAIN
,,,,,8. FOIE NIGIRI = DECADENT absolutely to die for
,,,,,9. FRIED MILK = NOM NOM NOM AGAIN
,,,,,Things ran much better the second time around and so Uchi has earned an additional star from me.  Thumbs up!
,,,,,-------------------------------------------
,,,,,*ORIGINAL 1/25 REVIEW (edited for space limits)*
,,,,,We adore Uchi Austin & Uchiko Austin.  So imagine our excitement when we heard Uchi Houston was here.  
,,,,,"Soft opening so the omakase menu was not ready yet. If you are undecided about what you want from the menu, your waiter may suggest you to trust them to provide you with a tasting menu based on your waiter's suggestions."
,,,,,DO NOT DO THIS (unless you like playing Russian Roulette).  
,,,,, 
,,,,,"Why?  A waiter's tasting menu is NOT the same as the chef's tasting menu.  I trust Uchi's chef taste buds, but no offense but I do not trust my newly trained waiter's taste buds.  My coworker came here the night before, let her waitress provide the tasting menu according to her suggestions, and went away hungry and highly disappointed in her experience.  "
,,,,,COOL TASTINGS
,,,,,"uchiviche - salmon, striped bass, tomato bell pepper, garlic cilantro - tasty with a kick... could have been a little colder  "
,,,,,"machi cure - smoked baby yellowtail, yucca crisp, marcona almond, asian pear, garlic brittle - thumbs up - tasty cool dish.  "
,,,,,"yokai berry - atlantic salmon, dinosaur kale, asian pear, yuzu - thumbs up"
,,,,,HOT TASTINGS
,,,,,"walu walu - oak-grilled escolar, candied citrus, yuzupon, myoga - The "
,,,,,caramelization of the toppings on the grilled fish was a delightful blend of flavor and texture
,,,,,"jar jar duck - countryside farms duck, kumquat, endive, rosemary smoke - served in a playful glass jar, but a little underwhelming for the most expensive hot food on the menu."
,,,,,"bacon tataki - pork belly, black lime, coriander, citrus, espresso fish caramel - I wouldn't know.  I ordered this for my end of the table, but it never came out.  (more on this later)"
,,,,,"pork jowl - brussels sprout kimchee, romaine, preserved lemon creme fraiche -   Some found the pork to be too fatty, but I loved it and the explosion of flavor coming from the brussels sprouts."
,,,,,AGEMONO 
,,,,,tempura anago - sea eel served with orange slice - not bad
,,,,,"tempura kabocha - japanese pumpkin served with ponzu sauce - some friends were not big fans of the potato-like texture of the japanese pumpkin, but I liked it."
,,,,,"TEMPURA BRIE RINGO - ORDER THIS!  tempura fried brie, apple chutney, sweet potato crisp - just as delicious as Uchi Austin!"
,,,,,"tempura karaage - fried marinated chicken, sansho pepper, seasonal pickle - If you like Taiwanese/Hong Kong style fried chicken, you'll be disappointed"
,,,,,SUSHI (each order is one piece)
,,,,,"sake toro - salmon belly, ikura - fatty salmon that just simply melts in your mouth in the most divine way."
,,,,,"hotate - spicy scallop, avocado - delicious buttery flavor as well."
,,,,,"boquerones - spanish anchovy - For some, it was an okay dill-flavored piece.  For others, it was not good."
,,,,,"foie nigiri - seared fois gras, quinoa - THEY RAN OUT OF FOIE NIGIRI during the meal =("
,,,,,gold tobiko - flying fish roe - pretty and golden but taste was a little underwhelming
,,,,,MAKIMONO (rolls)
,,,,,"shag - tempura roll, salmon, avocado, sun dried tomato - it was tasty but ordinary."
,,,,,"zero sen - yellowtail, avocado, shallot, cilantro, tobiko, yuzu - refreshingly herbal and citrus in flavor like a fish taco."
,,,,,bond roll w/ salmon - I wouldn't know.  It never came out.
,,,,,"ham & eggs - katsu pork belly, yolk, custard, esplette OMG THIS WAS SO GOOD.  I COULD HAVE EATEN A WHOLE BOWL OF THIS."
,,,,,DESSERT
,,,,,peanut butter semifreddo - apple miso sorbet - definitely interesting.
,,,,,"fried milk - chocolate milk, toasted milk, iced milk, sherbet - TASTY TASTY."
,,,,,OVERALL
,,,,,"Look, I get it that this was a soft opening and that our waiter was still in training.  Despite that, I can't give it 5 stars because of several key flaws:"
,,,,,"1. Orders were missed. Although items were fixed on our bill, our waiter insisted that the food was delivered and possibly eaten by our friends. Uh, what? I'm pretty sure I would have known if an entire roll was delivered. "
,,,,,2. Timing of the food - Our dinner took 3.5 hours. Our waiter put in food orders at such a staggered pace that we found ourselves without food at various points of the night
,,,,,I finally tried this place and I loved it!
,,,,,We made reservation for late night and they were still busy (no wonder!) Our server was Anthony he's honestly one of the best server I've ever met !!
,,,,,he went above and beyond to make our first visit amazing! 
,,,,,I loved all food he picked for us it was truly amazing I can't name and explain everything here but please ask for anthony you'll be happy with him just like us!!!!we'll be regular from now on 
,,,,,Thank you anthony for your awesome service!!!!!!

,,,,,"Houston, TX 77006"
,,,,,This was our first time at Uchi. We were so excited when we saw the extent of the vegetarian menu. 
,,,,,"We went with the vegetarian tasting menu ($60 per person) and were told that it would come with 7 or 8 courses. We were happily surprised when we got 13 different dishes. We got to try more than half of the items of the main vegetarian menu and happy hour menu. Everything was strongly flavored and seasoned to perfection. The -1 star is for the cost of everything. The portion sizes are small, so cost of food quickly adds up. "
,,,,,"For drinks I got the krinzan ""classic"" futsu-shu sake for $13. It was good and had a fruity taste to it, but overpriced. "
,,,,,1. Uchi Salad - The uchi salad is a daikon radish wrapped in greens which you eat by grabbing the daikon radish and dipping it into a delicious green creamy sauce. 
,,,,,2. Tomato nigiri - This consisted of two pieces of flavored tomato made to look like fish with seasonings on top. You eat it upside down to savor the flavor. I didn't like the strong tomato flavor to this one. 
,,,,,3. Avocado nigiri - This is two pieces of avocado dipped in a type of soy sauce. I love anything avocado dipped so enjoyed this one 
,,,,,4. Brussel sprouts - Brussel sprouts when done right are just delicious. This dish was amazing. The flavors fit really well together. 
,,,,,"5. Chef's vegetarian roll (makimono) - This came with 6 pieces of sushi that we split. This was good, but not as flavorful as the pitchfork makimono which I enjoyed a little bit more. "
,,,,,"6. konoko usuzukuri - This was an interesting mushroom dish made up flattened mushroom pieces dipped in a type of vinegar sauce. The flavors were very strong on this one. I wish this dish was a little bit warmer, but it tasted very cold like it came straight out of a fridge. The crisps that were on top were delicious "
,,,,,"7. Bok choy salad - this was our first actual warm dish. It is a bok choy salad that you eat with cashew butter. It has a hint of a spicy flavor to it. The cashew butter was delicious, creamy and warm. I didn't enjoy this salad as much as our first uchi salad. "
,,,,,8. Pitchfork makimono - This came with 8 pieces that we split. I liked this makimono dish more than chef's vegetarian roll makimono 
,,,,,"9. Nasu sushi - This came with 2 pieces of suchi topped with an eggplant. This was a very unique creamy dish. This was another warm dish. The flavors burst in your mouth when you take a bite, so be careful if it's hot. Very delicious! "
,,,,,10.  Kinoko suhi - This was 2 pieces of a mushroom sushi. The mushroom is made to look like a type of meat dipped in a flavored butter sauce. This was my least favorite item. The butter flavor was overpowering. 
,,,,,"11. Veggie mushi - This is a delicious warm, flavored soup with different vegetables inside. The soup has a slight sweet and tangy taste to it with a cream flavor. Very well done!  "
,,,,,"12. Veggie nabe - This is a unique dish. They bring out a rice dish with seasonal vegetables inside, break an egg over it, and mix it together in front of you. This causes the rice to crisp. I liked the unique flavor to it. At this point, we were full and couldn't finish this one. We took this one to go for lunch the next day. "
,,,,,"13. Fried Milk Dessert - The last course was dessert. The fried milk was unique and delicious! It consists of three fried milk balls that are warm and burst milky liquid into your mouth when you take a bite, with crisp fudge crisps, creamy vanilla ice cream, and delicious pieces of what tastes like a type of graham cracker. I wish they gave more fried milk balls in this one. "
,,,,,"Our favorites: pitchfork makimono, veggie mushi, veggie nabe, nasu sushi, fried milk "
,,,,,Overall a great experience! Service was great. The waiters were always watching to bring out the next dish for us. The total cost of all these dishes individually would have been $106 so not sure if the tasting menu which added up to $120 for two people was really worth it.
,,,,,"This place is a whole culinary experience. I came here for a birthday during a weekday and I was definitely not prepared for how amazing this place is. Our waiter Nick guided us through the process and recommended plates as we went and he did not miss! I did not try anything that I didn't like. I wish I could remember everything I tried but it was too much. I have to say the lychee natsu drink, uchi salad and the foi gras are a must try!!! The foi gras is literally an explosion of flavor in your mouth. I cannot recommend it enough. "
,,,,,"I would say after drinks and dessert we averaged about $100 per person but we left completely satisfied. It is pricey but 100% worth it. Amazing service, and ever better food!"
,,,,,Uchi is obviously an absolute must for happy hours or dinner! The ambiance fits the experience & the staff is on top of their game at all times! Parking is tough & a reservation with plenty of time in advance is advised! Strongly recommend their happy hour if you are new to sushi!
,,,,,"We made a reservation here and it was my first time! I don't know if I would come again, but it was definitely an experience. The people here are so nice and so attentive. Our server, Muk, especially treated us very well. She's so nice and knows the menu well and what she likes to recommend. I can't remember what we ate, but the small dishes had such unique flavors. I loved the pear and fish one with these somewhat white crackers. All of the fish was so fresh. My favorite piece was the uni, probably the best uni I've had! My bf really enjoyed the king trumpet mushroom nigiri. I wasn't really a fan of it, but he really enjoyed the texture! It is pricey, but I really love the atmosphere. Such a cool interior design and clean bathrooms!!"
,,,,,"The best food experience I've ever had. It was so great, the food, the staff, it's a full experience. Our waiter and server were top notch and very attentive. We tried multiple sake's until we found one we liked. And then we basically did a run through the entire menu. Almost everything was amazing and if it wasn't they took it off our tab. When in Houston Uchi is a must!"
,,,,,"I come here pretty often and my expectations are always exceeded. However, I came during the day and the food was so lackluster... everything's temperature was off. Hot foods weren't hot enough. The pistachio desert was awful,  sorbet tasted like straight vinegar and the cake was dry.. first desert I've had here that I did not like. This is my favorite restaurant but the food was just off.. not sure if it's because it's morning shift and the chefs aren't as knowledgeable or what ‍"
,,,,,(I will say that the severs were excellent & pleasant)
,,,,,I ordered a lot of dishes and most were delicious. My only complain were the scallops. They were not fresh and it should not have been served. I was first introduced to Uchi many many years ago and the Houston location was the first location. Dallas now has better quality.
,,,,,WoW WoW WoW ... 
,,,,,I mean WoW... it was one of the absolute most amazing place I have had sushi at... 
,,,,,We decided to let our chef go to work for us and create the menu... 
,,,,,WOW  I kept telling myself that I would take a pic cause the platting was amazing and simply Beautiful... but as soon as we saw the plate we just couple resist and kept eating... 
,,,,,6 course meal became 8 and Chef was very nice and generous... We even got two plates remade just cause we couldn't stop eating... 
,,,,,Anyone and Everyone who is in Houston must must go to this place... it's phenomenal yummy yummy yummy...
,,,,,"Literally the best sushi ever!! This place is absolutely amazing! This is by far the best sushi we have ever had. It lives up to it's hype, and I'm so happy it did. Our waiter Jay helped us and picked out a 10 course meal for us based on our likes and dislikes. He did amazing! The staff is exceptional they all work together so well. Can't wait to go again sometime! The fried milk dessert was amazing! The only picture I have is of the beef tartar because I was so excited to eat the food I forgot to take pictures! Try this place you will not be disappointed. Exceptional food and service is always at the top our list. The flavors are well balanced, the chef knows how to combine all of the flavors so well."
,,,,,"Having been a native Houstonian, it is a little surprising that the first time I've heard about Uchi was maybe 3 years ago and dined there for the first time tonight. Uchi is only open for dinner and we had a reservation for Friday night."
,,,,,It's located on Westheimer and has no parking; there was a parking garage with valet that we parked at and that Uchi will validate. 
,,,,,"Our server Linda was very knowledgeable and informative; I'd like to think we got the best of Uchi considering how much food we got. We started with drinks, hot/cold apps, rolls, sashimi/ Nigiri and then we tried one of each dessert. "
,,,,,Can't remember the name of every dish but here's the summary
,,,,,Great: 
,,,,,Hamachi cold dish with peppercorns (agreed best dish there)
,,,,,Foie Gras Nigiri 
,,,,,Makimono's with fish
,,,,,Below average:
,,,,,Tuna with the watermelon and basil? This was the only dish that did not taste good. No one at our table liked it. 
,,,,,"Did it live up to the hype? Kinda. The food is fantastic, and the price reflects it. Expected a little more from the ambiance but it was more casual than expected. Having been to Kata and Tobiuo and other high end sushi joints; this is definitely up there with them and probably beats them out in some aspects. Overall, a good date night place for those wanting to try non fusion Japanese cuisine. Maybe see when their happy hour is?"

,,,,,"Houston, TX 77006"
,,,,,I would like to preface this review with - I've been to this location as well as the Uchi and Uchiko in Austin. 
,,,,,"However, our latest visit to the Houston location was perhaps the best meal I've ever had - sushi or otherwise!!  We decided to splurge and ordered whatever sounded good and get seconds/thirds if desired. "
,,,,,"Food was AMAZING!!  Great variety of fish...all perfectly dressed!  No need to deal with soy sauce and wasabi!  We ordered a variety of nigiri, rolls and appetizers...perfection!!  Although if I had to choose 3-4, I would go for the A5, uni, otoro and foie gras."
,,,,,Service and atmosphere were great!
,,,,,Shout out to Nick our waiter who made all the suggestions - the BEST!!
,,,,,Such a fun dining experience and the happy hour is an incredible deal! Can't wait to go back again.
,,,,,"Valentines night and oh man was it delicious. The yellow tail was yummy yummy the jasmine cream was delicious. And the orange supreme gave extra freshness to each bite.  saketoro gosh dang dissolved in my mouth. Definitely need to go try if you're a seafood person. The veggie roll though is a pass for me, wasn't enough oomp."
,,,,,"My first experience here was for our anniversary a few months back, and it has changed the way I view sushi! Everything was impeccable!"
,,,,,We ordered the omakase with a primarily raw preference. Our server was very knowledgeable and was very attentive to our needs.
,,,,,Each course included high-quality and fresh ingredients that were tailored to our tastebuds! One of my favorites was the wagyu beef - literally will melt in your mouth. We extremely enjoyed our time here and can't wait to visit again!
,,,,,There's a reason why Uchi has so many good reviews and why you need to make reservations ahead of time. It definitely isn't cheap but I would say go at least once to go try! 
,,,,,The must orders are the uni and the foie gras! These will melt in your mouth! Honestly anything you order will be yummy but those two are a must. Make sure to try their selected sushi from the menu! Got to try some that I've never had before. 
,,,,,Make sure to leave room for dessert!
,,,,,Went for my birthday and as always the service and the food is exceptionally good and creative.
,,,,,"If you want omakase but are tired of the traditional way of just slices of fish and want something different, go try Uchi. "
,,,,,I love how each dish is something new for you to as they combine different ingredients to create a unique flavor. 
,,,,,"The quality of fish could improve, but then it would increase the price. I love how affordable it is compared to other joints that charge about 120-180 bucks in Houston and over 200+ on other places for omakase (chefs tasting menu). "
,,,,,Dessert is also really great. 
,,,,,"TIp: Go during happy hour so you can order some of the other ones that you like. I recommend the Wagyu that is super affordable as a happy hour menu. I remember paying $144 for 4oz of Wagyu at Nobu. At Uchi, you can enjoy wagyu without crying when paying for the bill."
,,,,,Follow me on Instagram @willeatfood
,,,,,"I love this place normally but our waiter, Eric, was not friendly or communicative and we felt neglected. He messsed up our order and was rude. On top of that we were celebrating my sisters' bday and didnt wish her a hapoy bday. Another waiter came by to give us the bday cake. Rude"
,,,,,"Our favorite spot to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries or something very special. We always go at 4pm and have a great time. We order the majority of items on the happy hour menu and of course anything the waiter recommends. My personal favorites are Brussels sprouts, ham & egg roll & gyutoro sushi. The gyutoro, 72 hour short rib is absolutely, hands down, the best item. I ordered 6 the last time I was there. We also got the Waygu Tataki and that was cooked to perfection. All the dishes were incredible, including the king crab sushi. "
,,,,,Get the milk dessert to conclude your evening. A wonderful atmosphere & delicious food!
,,,,,"Man Uchi does some things that are to die for, and some are ok, but I have my favorites.  The ambiance and dining experience is always pleasing.  It took me several visits to try the entire menu, and I'd say I love about 30% of the items that are impressive."
,,,,,"I can see Ushi may not delight everyone, some may see this as pretentious, overpriced and overly decorated or ""chefy"", but like I said, some of the items have impressed me by their creativity in combination of ingredients and skilled execution."
,,,,,"Some places love decorating with flowers and micro greens but the food itself is just plane Jane.   I feel Uchi ingredients have purpose, there's subtle hints of flavors for the trained palette.   I also feel there's a good balance and direction with their dishes, where add-ons enhance and do not take over."
,,,,,"Bites are small, expect to spend $$$$"
,,,,,"Yum yum! My boyfriend and I heard a lot of good things about Uchi, so we decided to give it a try."
,,,,,"We were seated at the sushi bar, which was an excellent location for having a course (omakase) menu. "
,,,,,I would recommend the omakase option to those who are trying at Uchi for the first time. 
,,,,,The food definitely lived up to our expectations. 
,,,,,The staff were also very friendly.
,,,,,"The sake we ordered (Sake hakkaisan kijohshu) was very reasonably priced, and was very tasty (I am usually very picky with sake but this one was great! I would recommend this sake even to those who do not really like sake in general)"
,,,,,Would definitely love to come again to Uchi!

,,,,,"Houston, TX 77006"
,,,,,"Excellent meal from start to finish! We had a reservation for 2 at 4:30 and were promptly seated at a comfortable booth. The interior is contemporary with lots of warm wood accents. Our server, Sohan, was prompt and friendly. We each started with a Kara Kyuri cocktail, which happened to be on the happy hour menu. It was very light and refreshing, though the Thai chili gave it a very spicy kick. It is not for the faint of heart, so if you would prefer something less spicy, the Satsuma and Lychee Natsu are also great. The lychee cocktail was actually our favorite and is dangerously easy to drink. They also have an excellent and extensive list of sake. "
,,,,,"We started with the Yokai Berry, the Walu Walu, the Hama Chili,  and the Pitchfork. All were on the happy hour menu and all were excellent. We actually ended up ordering another Yokai Berry later in the meal because it was so delicious. The flavors were all delicately balanced and interesting. "
,,,,,"We then moved on to the Wagyu Hot Rock, Bluefin Maki, and Pork Belly. The Wagyu was unsurprisingly melt-in-your-mouth amazing and the pork belly was cooked to perfection. The bluefin maki was such a nice surprise. The orange really sent the roll in an unexpected, but delightful direction. We finished with the Sake Namida, some Hokkaido Uni, and the Fried Milk for desert. "
,,,,,"Everything we had was excellent and I would definitely order anything we ate again. Because most of our visit was during happy hour, our bill was very reasonable for the number of dishes we ordered."
,,,,,Here we are again and this visit was to only have desserts as we had no room in our past visits. 
,,,,,Jasmine cream was still impressive but the fried milk was meh. Three small pastries of fried milk sitting on chocolate mousse. I wasn't a fan at all. 
,,,,,Decided to get a couple of HH cold dishes and they were good. Server was friendly and told us Uchi Ku (sister restaurant) opens in next Spring. Hence they are training all these staffs.
,,,,,"I've been to Uchi twice and both experiences were great. I decided to take my husband for our anniversary dinner. I'd like to say that we have been doing several omakase like MF, Hidden, Soto, etc this past couple of months. "
,,,,,"Uchi is very popular and we were only able to make a 5 pm reservation. It's earlier than our preference but hey, that's happy hour time! So this review isn't for omakase as it's too early to have a full (12+ courses) meal. "
,,,,,"Needless to say, we got several items off the happy hour menu and a couple off the regular one. The bluefin flight was alright as there was connective tissue in it where I don't expect it. The hama chili and walu walu were both great that we even had seconds. Don't really care for the rolls as the seaweeds were too chewy. Pork belly was a bit too dry as well. The jasmine cream dessert was wonderful! "
,,,,,There was a mix-up in our food towards the end but was rectified immediately. Aisha was our server and she gave us a gift card for future use. Service was impeccable as our water glasses were ALWAYS full. It was packed on a weekday afternoon but valet parking in the garage near the corner (3 mins walk).
,,,,,I love Uchi so much! I came here with two others and we shared 16 dishes. There wasn't a dish I didn't like but a few of my favorites included: 
,,,,,*Brussels Sprouts - a classic appetizer
,,,,,*Hirame Usuzukuri - this was light and fresh
,,,,,*Karaage - fried chicken
,,,,,*Hana - fried cauliflower
,,,,,*Hama Chili - this fish tasted like butter
,,,,,*Ham & Egg - a classic roll
,,,,,"*Spicy Crunchy Tuna, Zero Sen, and Sake Namida - these were also great rolls! "
,,,,,*Fried Milk - a classic dessert
,,,,,"This is my favorite happy hour! This place does not disappoint. I always order the ham and egg roll and the brussel sprouts. The ham and egg roll is my favorite! I could eat 5. :) I always eat at the sushi bar and the chefs are always super nice and attentive. Both times I have gone, the sushi chefs have given me free dessert! I have tried the pistachio ice cream and the fried milk. Both are incredible! I love this place! The parking is valet only so I usually park on the street or valet my car if I am carrying cash."
,,,,,"My first experience here was for our anniversary a few months back, and it has changed the way I view sushi! Everything was impeccable!"
,,,,,We ordered the omakase with a primarily raw preference. Our server was very knowledgeable and was very attentive to our needs. 
,,,,,Each course included high-quality and fresh ingredients that were tailored to our tastebuds! One of my favorites was the wagyu beef - literally will melt in your mouth. We extremely enjoyed our time here and can't wait to visit again!
,,,,,"Tried the vegetarian omakase and it might have been the best meal I've ever had. It was my first time trying sushi, so i didn't know what to expect, but I was blown away. Every single item the chef prepared was delicious with unique flavor combinations and unlike anything i've tasted. The servers were very attentive, promptly filling water glasses, bringing out new plates, and explaining what each dish is. The ambiance is also very beautiful and has an expensive feel to it."
,,,,,"I'd recommend making a reservation before you come. Also, parking can be a bit difficult since there's a lot of construction around the area. I ended up street parking a few streets behind the restaurant, but they also have valet. overall, a bit pricey but absolutely worth it for a special night out! i"
,,,,,"Came here for a work event, and the food was spectacular. Service was great, and lots of fun dishes to try. The dessert was out of this world."
,,,,,I just don't get the hype of this place. Even during happy hour the food was outrageously expensive. 
,,,,,We spent about $50 per person including a cheap beer and one saki shot each. 
,,,,,"The food tasted very good if I remember correctly, but there was so little of it in each portion that I couldn't adequately take in all the flavors as my stomach growled ferociously. "
,,,,,I left hungry enough to pick up food down the street an hour later. 
,,,,,Thank god I didn't get caught with a check during regular hours. My buddy told me his parents took him and his girlfriend out to Uchi on a weekend and spent $800 FOR FOUR PEOPLE! He left only somewhat full. 
,,,,,"I'm not above paying for good food, even in Houston where cheap options abound. But the purpose of food is to be enjoyed AND to fill your stomach. If you charge a lot, I better not leave hungry."
,,,,,Second time at Uchi and both times were great! Fave sushi spot in Houston! 
,,,,,"Foie gras (5/5) must try! Succulent, melt in your mouth with the perfect rice ratio some highlights: "
,,,,,King crab (5/5) also a must try! This was an eye-opening experience. The butter coats the crab and rice perfectly! 
,,,,,The Hama Chile was delicate and light (5/5)
,,,,,Walu walu (4.5/5) delicious but not as delicate 
,,,,,Bluefin maki (4/5) the herb in the roll is a bit intense for my taste but still delicious 
,,,,,Bluefin chutoro(4.5/5) Much better than the salmon or bluefin maki in my o
,,,,,"Salmon belly (3.5/5) pretty disappointing, have definitely had better"
,,,,,Pork belly (4.5/5) they melt in your mouth and doesn't have a greasy taste that a lot of places have but the flavor is just okay 
,,,,,The uni dishes are amazing! The uni is fresh and doesn't have that fishy taste that many other places have 
,,,,,Would also recommend chef's choice with preference for sashimi. You won't be disappointed!
,,,,,It has been years since I've been back to this restaurant and Ofcourse they do not ever disappoint. I went during their daily happy hour from 4-6. We ordered both vegetarian and regular happy hour menu. Each piece was full of flavor and packed with amazing texture to boost the taste. The service was great! I did not make a reservation but I was able to be seated right away by the bar. Place was packed so I recommend to make a reservation. I must go back again and try their regular menu.
,,,,,"Wow! My group of 8 made reservations on a Saturday night and our table was immediately ready. Enjoyed the atmosphere, the wait staff, and the food was SO GOOD. We sampled a lot of dishes. My favorite was the Nigiri sushi that night. It was so fresh it tasted like butter. I also really enjoyed the foie gras sushi - 2 of my favorite things in one! I never had anything like that before and it was delicious!"

,,,,,I made a reservation through Yelp for this restaurant because of the high ratings. I dined with 3 people on an early Friday evening. We started with pork belly poutine and pig candy. Pig candy was very good. Pork belly poutine was just okay compared to pig candy. I had the spicy crab pasta as my entree and it was underwhelming. It was a tad bit spicy but mostly flat in other flavor. Our server was very nice but they did mess up my brother in law's order because they forgot the egg on his sandwich.
,,,,,"My fiance is a huge bourbon fan, so I knew he'd be interested in checking out the whiskey scene outside of Kentucky. His opinion of their drinks was ""good,"" so he was not disappointed or very impressed."
,,,,,Overall I expected more because of the high ratings and the superb location.
,,,,,So boom I moved to Houston in Aug of 2019 and haven't really domwuch exploring . My best friend who lives here has done her best to introduce me to new places when ever we hang out but this time I got to pick . Ended up doing takeout and I im not gonna lie I was super excited plus I was hungry I didn't even take any pictures but needles to say it was a great pick and next time I visit def using it as a date location
,,,,,"Came in and got a table of four. Ordered some happy hour items. Very tasty & drinks were good. Had a 5th friend show up, and they refused to pull a chair up to the table despite there being several tables open and chairs unused. Our 5th guest stood until we left. They asked if we could move to the 6 top. The staff said no. Soon after, seated 3 people at the 6 top. We were very displeased. "
,,,,,"When we tried to get our check, the waiter walked away as we were trying to tell him how to split our check. "
,,,,,"Good food, but will not return."
,,,,,"Met my sister and a group here for brunch, and this place was popping!  Even around 11am on a Sunday when Bosscat opened for the day, things were bustling, and for good reason-- with a quaint atmosphere of southern hospitality, super nice service, and huge portions of mouth watering food, BCK is a great choice for brunch, lunch, or anything your tummy desires :)"
,,,,,"Our server did a great job helping us out, and our waters were always refilled. Everyone was happy with their food. I had the protein flapjacks-- two thick and heart my pancakes with walnut and sugar free syrup on the side accompanied by two very peppery chicken sausage patties. Just what I needed after a big workout!  The veggie omelet was studded with colorful veggies and showcased its ooey gooey cheesiness when people inadvertently displayed nice cheese pulls with each bite :)  And the chicken fried steak was an enormous plate of thick fried meat covered with savory brown gravy.  In case that wasn't enough to clog your arteries, there is a mountain of scrambled eggs on top.  The friends said it was tasty, and they finished the massive 10inch piece of meat!  "
,,,,,"I would totally come back again, especially to dine outside when it gets warmer again. BCK's seating is good for groups, couples, and even has a bar area too. If you're looking for a new place to brunch or just nom, check out Bosscat's :D"
,,,,,Bosscat once again! 
,,,,,Love this place! Drinks are always a hit and you can't forget about their amazing happy hour! Ask for Dan !!
,,,,,"This place is amazing  quick service , 2hr minimum per table. Saturday was busy, definitely recommend calling ahead!! Shops near by and galleria is near by too so you know we going to walk off our food (;"
,,,,,Pig candy was great. Rest of food was ok. Dry burger and the darkest fries I've ever seen. Atmosphere makes the place .
,,,,,5 stars for three reasons: 1-some of the best cocktails I have had in Houston 2- incredible customer service and 3- Dr. Pepper chicken wings. 
,,,,,"I came here for a spontaneous outing with friends and was definitely pleasantly surprised with the experience! We were served by Terry and Omar who were so friendly and energetic. Honestly, they made the experience! "
,,,,,"I saw the Dr. Pepper wings on another Yelp review and was so excited to indulge but when I asked for them, I was told they were not available. However, Terry was so kind to ask the chef to prepare them special for me (which I greatly appreciated!). "
,,,,,We also tried the fried mushrooms which were great. I look forward to coming back to taste more of the menu items.
,,,,,"I had my birthday brunch here! It was actually recommended by my sister who thought the vibe was very cute for my birthday and I agree. I was able to make a brunch reservation for 10 people with no problem. Just like majority of the restaurants, the party won't get seated unless majority of the party is present. The only thing I did not like was the check splitting system, so they only allow eight forms of payment to be used, I guess I understand but it was just annoying and kind of an inconvenience. There is also a one dollar charge per slice of cake that is cut by the waiter or waitress."
,,,,,"But other than those nuances, the food was amazing. I'm ordered the fruity pebble's French toast which was sweet and had pieces of bacon. So it was sweet and salty at the same time. There was also fresh fruit on the plate as well. My friends had ordered a short rib dish that was also amazing (I can't remember the name). My really good friend ordered the ""breakfast in bed"" shot which was surprisingly good! I really like this place for brunch, I will need to come back and try their happy hour and/or dinner."
,,,,,"We tried the brunch today - everything was spectacular! The ambience is nice, service by Jerry was superb, and the food was delicious. We tried the Chilaquiles, Smokehouse egg benedict, shrimp and grits, and the apple cheesecake waffle. We will be back to do whiskey tasting."

The fried oysters were a bit bland, but with the sauce that it came with, it was okay. This is a place where you can go on a date or get a quick bite. The scenery of this place was nice. Would've definitely sat outside if it weren't for the rain."
,,,,,I had the BBQ salmon and it was so good. Definitely recommend it. 
,,,,,The place in itself is awesome. Really outgoing atmosphere and the customer service was great. 
,,,,,Will definitely come again!
,,,,,Excellent place for food and drinks! I went with a bunch of girlfriends and we had so much fun. Food is excellent! We liked everything we ordered!
,,,,,I had the best lunch of my life here today!!!
,,,,,The pork chop was so tasty and tender I could slice through it like butter! I want to order it every day this week for lunch! 
,,,,,The flatbread was delicious and had this tasty sauce to it that I need the recipe for!!
,,,,,"Very nice and spacious restaurant inside a plaza. They hold late hours. A fight broke out while we were there and the cops were called. In fact, the drunk guy that instigated the fight with another person there, happen to land on our rental car when he got punched (thankfully no damage was done to the car). The drunk guy was yelling out offensive stuff to multiple people. Although there was much commotion and attention on the fight, I was tipsy and starving so I asked the hostess at the front how much the box of mini donuts (from some other company?) at the front cost, and she gave me two for free because she felt bad about the fight. They actually ended up being dry, but I didn't care, I was hungry. Aside from that, I'd order everything we got again: candied pork belly, broccolini, pork chop, and short rib. I was bummed that they were out of the whiskey okra (I think that's what it was), hopefully I'll get a chance to return and try it."
,,,,,"Ok this place is fun and Gavin started the party.  Mimosas, brunch and a great place make this a must.  Just made the go to when in town."

,,,,,I'm so sorry to leave this review. I know it happens every now and again but I got food poisoning and I'm literally afraid to look in the direction of this place. This is why it's taken me damn near a year to write this review. 
,,,,,I love the ambiance. The drinks. I don't even remember what I had but I believe that I found it tasty though I did realize that something was off. It wasn't until things were coming out of the top and the bottom of me that I realized that something was WAAAAAY off. God help me!!!
,,,,,I wanted to love this place. Unfortunately I can never go back. I even missed my flight because of this (pre-covid). Sux. Truly.
,,,,,Started off on the wrong foot but the staff really turned it around for us :)
,,,,,"Great experience for me and my wife. Made reservations since every time we go it's always packed. Our waiter was fantastic, made sure to always check on us. My wife had the fruity pebbles French toast and I had the simple breakfast. Food was all good, it is pricey so it's a once in a while visit but overall it was worth it, I will be back."

,,,,,So not cool calling your patrons Karen. We went across the street to Eloise Nichols and found it a much better atmosphere and better pricing on their drinks.
,,,,,"John,"
,,,,,I never asked you for an apology nor do I want one. The negative connotation of Karen is becoming more of a racist statement than just someone who complains. If you wouldn't use a term to describe other races or groups in a negative way then you should rethink using that one.
,,,,,Let me clarify for you. I did go in with 4 people. It was an older crowd and they weren't up to date on the terminology. We were seated and I asked the host about the sign to make sure it wasn't a mistake because surely in this culture and COVID a restaurant owner or manager would not possibly be making such a statement to further alienate his business but you're clarification is all I needed to understand you're ignorance of the current situation we're in.
,,,,,"So here is more in the review. Music was loud, the service was very slow and the waiter was inattentive. Not many people in the place at the time and I still had to look around for him then we decided to leave. The drink was on the pricey side for what we received. Anvil is much better for the price and atmosphere as well. Really sad because I love bourbon and the bartender couldn't even do that right. Your establishment just doesn't offer anything special. Several establishments have a large bourbon selection. Try Whiskey Cake. Happy hour $5 old fashion made to perfection. "
,,,,,Your poor answer is exactly why people should stay away from your establishment.
,,,,,"Hey Glenn,"
,,,,,I had to stew over my response to your poor review. As the owner I take responsibility for everything that happens at any of my restaurants. I also read and respond to every single review either publicly or privately. Just as you have a right to post a poor review without having had an experience inside my restaurant I to have a right to add some levity to a toxic situation that’s happening all around us. The fact that you took great offense to that reaffirms why the sign was there in the first place. I do hope you enjoyed your meal next-door as I too love that restaurant. The sign will remain and I hope you can be lighthearted in the midst of all of this chaos. That’s what we’re trying to do and I will not apologize.

,,,,,Yum. Yum. Yum. We had burgers and chips! Always a good time here. Nice vibes. Cool atmosphere. Great local.
,,,,,Drinks are absolutely  presentations of every drink we had was beautiful too. 
,,,,,We had the spicy chicken and cheese dip for starter and it was pretty good.
,,,,,But ONE WORD....well two SHORT RIB. 
,,,,,It was amazing. So tender. So flavorful. 10/10
,,,,,"Excellent service and food! Drinks are always fast and fabulous. From the greeter to the waitstaff to the bartenders and chefs, this is a regular place for us!"
,,,,,"We stopped for lunch, and I wasn't impressed. We ordered the chicken sandwich; the chicken was overcooked. The potato logs were overcooked. I ordered the pork filled hushpuppies; they were tasteless. The mac and cheese lacked flavor. It was rather disappointing. The best items were the  whiskey scorched okra and the fried oysters. "
,,,,,"The staff checked on us a lot, but didn't listen very well. She asked if everything was okay, and I said, ""no"". She said, ""great"" and walked away."
,,,,,"Came for steak night on Monday. A lot of food for $24.99. Small salad, a roll, green beans, spicy Mac, and a NY strip steak. Spicy Mac was SPICY. Food wasn't bad for the price we were paying. The cornbread as an appetizer was alright (wouldn't order again). But the fried apple pie desert was the best part!!!"
,,,,,My friend and I was looking for a spot to grab a bite to eat before heading home.. she knows that I am the Yelp queen! Luckily this place came up and we decided to give it a try and boy we are happy that we did! I love quaint hidden gems with quality food and drinks . This place is it.. and the Monday night steak special is to die for... seasoned to perfection and nice and hot (fresh)! I order the BC tea which was different than what J expected but not bad... I will definitely be returning!
,,,,,"First time visiting and I will definitely be back! The joined the waiting list at 12:12pm and was seated at 1:11pm. Totally worth the wait! The food was delicious, staff was so friendly, one of the kitchen staff took our order which was super nice because I was able to order his recommended which was the fruity pebbles French toast with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It wasn't too sweet either!!!"
,,,,,"Went to Bosscat last night with my boyfriend. Had a reservation for 8:45. We arrived around 15 minutes early so there was a wait....no big deal but we should have taken that as a sign. We were finally seated 10 to 15 minutes after our reservation time. Our waitress was Marissa. She was lack luster to say the least. More concerned with her large table than making sure we had what we needed. We got water with no straws and had to ask twice before receiving them, although she brought them out immediately for her other tables (I watched). After the food arrived she only came back once to check on us which was when we were almost done eat the unseasoned food. We had to ask the person filling our water for the tab. I guess she told Marissa who eventually brought it without asking how our dinner was. She just dropped the ticket and walked away. Usually a great tipper, well over 20% standard but on this occasion she definitely was getting the same tip as the service she provided. I highly doubt I will ever be back!"
,,,,,"Bosscat did not disappoint. This is my 2nd visit here and I am equally as pleased as I was the 1st time. Today, I had a couple mimosas, the Breakfast in bed shot, the Bosscat fries and the Donut Burger. I thoroughly enjoyed everything, including the shot which contained maple bourbon, orange juice on the side and a slice of bacon. The maple bourbon was extremely thick and sweet and tasted like drinking syrup. Aside from that, all together it was pretty good. Although a very unique drink, I probably would not order that again. "
,,,,,"My donut burger was DELICIOUS and the fries were pretty good, too. The mimosa was just a mimosa. "
,,,,,"My friends seemed to really enjoy their meals, as well. "

,,,,,"Waitress was great! Hostess was so incredibly rude this past Friday night. Talked to me & my party like we were dumb. We waited almost an hour just to get in just to be sat at 1 of 2 tables that were open when we first came in. I asked if it was because someone was a no show that's why we were finally able to get the vacant table & she replied ""clearly yes someone didn't show up so we could seat you now, that's how it works"". The 2nd vacant table was also open the from the moment we walked in until we left as well."
,,,,,We all ordered steaks & an app of fries. None of us were very impressed.
,,,,,"I have been twice now, sitting at the bar both times.  The cocktails are excellent and the bartenders very friendly.  My food was excellent and I appreciated the suggestions from bartenders.  I will be back next time I'm in town."
,,,,,"I love every time I come to Bosscat! The customer service is impeccable and I always feel welcomed. The staff is so informative about their menu items and seem to know the perfect items to recommend! Jackie, one of the waitresses, is always on her A-game! Highly recommend!!"
,,,,,"Bosscat is the place to be!!! They have amazing food options for brunch, lunch & dinner as well as phenomenal cocktails. (Ask for the Bosscat) "
,,,,,The staff is always so friendly and very knowledgeable. Highly recommend swinging by and indulging. You will not be disappointed! 
,,,,,"P.S. shoutout to PJ for always making everyone feel so welcomed! I will be back ASAP. Aka tomorrow... Same time, same place? :)"
,,,,,When arriving at Bosscat kitchen we had called to see if there was any openings available and they said that it wasn't we still went and as lucky as we found there was more than enough tables open for now the service was tremendous he did everything that he could for us and that was great the food it was delicious that burrito I would highly recommend it. Now when we received all my mimosas we have blue specs in it and they was happily to refresh our drinks and make us a new one. Well I was thinking we was gonna be compensated for having mimosas with blue specs in it and we had already drunk on it that could've got us sick but no it was not taken off Our checks.  But other than that the place was nice the food was delicious I was just hoping for a better service.
,,,,,What a great place for brunch! We came here to celebrate a friends new job and as a going away brunch before she leaves the city. 
,,,,,"The restaurant was decorated for Christmas and we loved how decorations fit in with the whisky bar decor. The staff was attentive, friendly, and was always wearing masks for covid protection. The tables were spaced out and I felt very safe coming here during covid. "
,,,,,"We started with a strong cup of coffee which I loved! I ordered the breakfast burrito and my boyfriend got the Smokehouse Benedict which were both amazing! The breakfast burrito had a nice crisp on the outside and a great combination of egg, cheese, and sausage inside! The spicy chicken sauce on the side was a great bonus and added the perfect amount of flavor to your burrito. The Benedict was also very tasty and came with a hearty serving of potatoes which were perfectly cooked and crispy! "
,,,,,Overall the food and service was great! Will have to come back to try their whisky list and dinner menu!
,,,,,"Great food, drinks and atmosphere! Went to celebrate my friends birthday and they had a birthday shot for him!! Will definitely be back!!"
,,,,,"Giving 3 stars because of MY experience but I feel like they could def be better. We ordered the steak special they had- the waiter then comes back and says they are out of steak so offered us another option for the ""same price"" - at the end they ended up charging us more for the other option they had. The food was pretty good though. Willing to give this place another try."
,,,,,Food is good but not amazing. Short rib and appetizers are pretty good. But the salmon and shrimp and grits weren't my favorite but not bad. The vibe is great for date night or drinks with friends. Great bar and drink selection. I also really liked the desserts!

,,,,,"Bosscat review update.  First visit was underwhelming, but manger followed up and asked us to try again.  That was before Covid.  Went back this weekend primarily due to scotch selection for friend.  Great experience.  Appetizers (fried oysters and pulled pork hush puppies) were great.   Wife had catfish with sweet chili sauce and risotto, best dish of the evening.  Friends had pork chop and short ribs.  Pork chop second best dish.  All great.  I had chop salad, very good.  Service was outstanding.  Buddy was enjoying scotch selection (you need to request the whiskey bible to see items in the whiskey room).  The first one he picked was almost gone and Bosscat decided it should be on house.  Still on the noisy side. We did request quiet spot with reservation.  They did a nice job of selecting table."
,,,,,"Not sure why Bosscat has been rated so highly.  It is a trendy night spot with very good drinks.  But the food was not great. I had shrimp and grits, very little flavor.  Wife and daughter had short ribs, ok.  Very noisy."

,,,,,"I came here recently (during covid) around lunch time and it wasn't super packed, but thankfully other patrons were still there giving their business! On a beautiful day, this space is stunning as the natural light comes into the building in droves. I sat at the bar, and was able to sit down and order immediately from the bartender (full menu). He was kind, quick, and the bar (entire space really) was super clean - a plus during the pandemic."
,,,,,"I ordered a beer and an order of the pig candy, which was delicious! I don't think I saw it on the menu, but I know they'd had it before (and truth be told, it was the reason I returned) so I asked if they still had it - and they thankfully did. If you're looking for some deliciously sticky sweet pork belly, this is the dish you want. It comes with kimchi, but is delicious all on its own. Definitely recommend!"
,,,,,"Didn't get the opportunity to try anything.  Tried calling before I drove over half an hour just to make it here 30 minutes before closing.... however NO ANSWER.  So I just took the chance.  Upon arrival it appears to be closed, chairs and stools stacked.  But I viewed a couple inside.  Went in.  Was inform the bar open till 1:45am. But kitchen closed at 11pm. "
,,,,,"Host was great, and made suggestions on late hours places in the area, like Katz and a tex Mexican grill,  Ruthies I believe... I guess I may visit back for their unique brunch.... but until then I'll call it a Katz kinda night."
,,,,,"I hate that I made a blank trip, could have been avoided from one answer of the phone call... theirs literally NO ONE in here for them to miss any calls."
,,,,,"Food was just ok.. Corn bread was cold and the rib was soooo fatty.. Brussels sprouts were GROSS. plus service was HORRIBLE, starting at the door. No one seemed to really care whether we were enjoying the food or not.. definitely not coming back."
,,,,,Stopped here for dinner while we were on vacation. The service was pretty good and the aesthetic was amazing.
,,,,,The BIG disappointment was the food...
,,,,,"We paid quite a lot for the 12 hour short ribs, Spicy Chicken Sandwich, and the pulled pork Hush puppies. They sounded great on paper. But when we got the food there was an odd taste to everything and the short ribs were more of a tasting than an actual entree (very small portion). I think they were trying to hard to be fancy or something. It did not work out..."
,,,,,"So glad we came for dinner here! The ambiance was beautiful, staff was delightful (I forgot our great server's name... Jacky maybe?) Everything we had ordered was scrumptious. The short rib, the salmon, the fries (even though at first I thought they were burnt) I'm so glad Newport Beach has a location because we will definitely be going there in the meantime while we come back to Houston. Thank you guys!!"
,,,,,"Hate to say ... But, I wasn't that impressed. "
,,,,,I was excited on arrival! Neat building and location. Everything looked very pretty at first glance. 
,,,,,One I went to the ladies room my mind began to change. It could use a scrub down an dusting. I could only get one sink to function and that one was barley putting any water out. 
,,,,,Our server was fantastic... Andrew. I give you a 95%
,,,,,"Thanks for doing such a wonderful job. Buy then your shift was well over and we were handed off. Andrew set the bar.... Sorry next waiter, I don't recall your name. Be more confident. I didn't really feel like you even wanted to be there. I mean, but really does; unless your own the other end. "
,,,,,My friend and I enjoyed the meat an cheese selections. Why so much bread though!? And not even good bread. (My opinion) 
,,,,,Great olive selection. 
,,,,,The rest of the food I could take it of leave it really. 
,,,,,Steak was ok... and the tuna was taken over with the pepper crust. Small portion.

,,,,,YUM! Our server was super sweet we sat outside and he moved the umbrellas around so that we would have shade. 40 min wait on Sunday morning at 11am (typical) without a reservation. Super good food!
,,,,,"Went to bosscat yesterday for my boyfriends birthday. We sat outside which was nice - however, the music was SO loud. I could barely hear my boyfriend across the table and felt like I had to scream. I didn't mind the music but don't think there's a need to blare it. "
,,,,,"On to the food...we started out with the chicken and cheese dip which was very good and a bit spicy. My boyfriend got the 12 hr short rib - which was fabulous - I wish I had gotten that! I got the brick chicken and I wasn't a fan. The chicken was fatty in my opinion and the rice was not my favorite. If I were to return, I'd get the short rib but I don't know if I would come back given the loud music."
,,,,,Ahi tuna wraps and short rib grilled cheese were so good.  Great happy hour menu Mon-Friday 3-6pm
,,,,,"Bosscat's premise as a restaurant/bar is good, but it fails on other ends. The food is mediocre AT BEST and lacks flavor and creativity. Hubby and I ordered the Brussel sprouts, salmon, pulled pork sandwich and chopped salad. "
,,,,,Brussel Sprouts - Flavor was okay but the sprouts were super greasy and overly cheesy
,,,,,Salmon - Very small piece that was served almost cold and was overcooked.
,,,,,"Chopped salad - nothing out of the ordinary, a regular salad you could easily make at home."
,,,,,Pulled pork sandwich was dry and the bread wasn't strong enough to hold in all the meat and toppings. Sandwich fell apart pretty quickly.
,,,,,"And can we talk about how loud the music is?! I'm all for music at a restaurant, what is not okay is music so loud you can't hear yourself speak. Music so loud, you feel like you're at Vegas club. I literally couldn't wait to get out of the restaurant! A 2nd visit to Bosscat is highly unlikely.0"
,,,,,"Good food, great atmosphere and very inviting staff. Portions were smaller than I would have expected for the price, but times are tough so I understand. Lastly, the bacon used in the Bloody Mary drinks and with the ""breakfast in bed"" shot sits out freely on the counter just waiting for Covid to jump on it . Yuck."
,,,,,Good location and vibe.  The weather this evening was great and they had the restaurant opened up which made it very nice.
,,,,,"Good service, sat at the bar.  Tasty cocktails, saw a lot of good food at other tables/bar.  I had the chicken sandwich and French fries.  The chicken sandwich was just ok, should have gone with the burger or pork sandwich as they looked really good.  I'm a French fry snob so these are not for me.  These were more like potato wedges, thick cut, large chunks.  Not for me."
,,,,,Worth a second trip back to try other menu items.
,,,,,"This place was VERY good. Everything we ordered was amazing. We got the chicken and sausage pasta, BBQ salmon, short ribs, picked veggies and OMG the fried apple pie. Chef Anthony even came out to talk to us what a great touch. Try this place you WILL NOT regret it! OH yeah the drinks and service was also on point!"
,,,,,All the food is phenomenal with a great location and atmosphere! With over 300 whiskey options to choose from this spot is a one of a kind!
,,,,,I've been here more than 3x lol it's the Tatars y'all and the environment. My sister ordered the shrimp and grits I had the fruity pebble french toast and my cousin had the chicken friend steak

,,,,,"First time here, as we were visiting from Atlanta. From start to finish, everyone was friendly and service was immaculate. We had the gulf shrimp & grits and corn crusted catfish with the mushroom risotto. Both dishes were amazing, it was a lot of food so they boxed it up for us to go. Update: it almost tasted better the next day! "
,,,,,The drinks were as good as they looked! 
,,,,,"The actual restaurant aesthetic: amazing, and restrooms were extremely clean. When we're in Houston again we will be visiting and ASK FOR RIGO! He was so attentive and gave great recommendations."
,,,,,"We went one Saturday for brunch with out a reservation and unfortunately we were turned away. We made a reservation for the following Saturday, and when we came back, we were able to be seated. The kitchen manager came out and told us that there was a note on our reservation, that we were there the previous week, and that we had travelled from Hockley, and he brought out the most delicious waffle, saying thank you for coming back. This place is awesome. The food is great and we had a great brunch"
,,,,,"So, I'm not a real vegan but this has to be the best vegan anything I have ever had. The mushroom that's used as the protein is packed with a lot of flavored and the texture is still meaty. The bun is soft and has a nice outside crisp to it. I'd take this over a real burger any day. "
,,,,,"I normally sit at the bar and the bar tenders are always kind, attentive, and they make sure you're satisfied! "
,,,,,The music and the lighting of the restaurant provides you with a nice chill but fun ambiance.
,,,,,"Came here 30 minutes before closing time and was worried that the service would be lacking. Thankfully I was completely wrong. Our server was attentive and provided great suggestions. This hit the spot tonight. We just came for drinks and appetizers, but everything was fresh and tasty. Would highly recommend. Can't wait to try it during daylight hours too!"
,,,,,"First time here visiting from Las Vegas! Sam the bartender was great and gave me a great recommendation. Spicy chicken sandwich hit the spot, I'm gonna come back for brunch."
,,,,,This was not a good visit.  They have 4 main courses and they run out of one.  3 people in the party order it.  Server was arrogant and unprofessional.  Manager did her best to make it right but the lack of professionalism from the server along with the running out of food far outweighed the response.  
,,,,,Work needs to be done in the preparation stages of this restaurant seems as if they are completely reactive and are not communicating with each other.  How could the server not know when ordering that 25% of the main courses were not available?  
,,,,,In addition when your out on a double date with your friend last thing you want or need is an arrogant unapologetic server.  
,,,,,"Cool decor, bad service and food."
,,,,,"Brunch menu dull, with the exception of the tater tots which are almost worth going back for by themselves"

,,,,,"This restaurant is still operating during COVID, allowing both dine in and takeout options. Dine-in capacity has been significantly reduced to comply with physical distancing, and they have no-touch menus now. Also all of the staff members wear masks, which I was happy to see. It's very nice inside and has an urban yet upscale vibe."
,,,,,"Food wise, the experience was mixed. I ordered the short rib chilaquiles at first. However the dish I received looked very different from the pictures on Yelp. The meat looked more like ground beef than short rib. And the dish as a whole looked like nachos. Since I was expecting brisket and a better presentation, I opted to go with the shrimp and grits instead. It was very unique and came with a tomato-based sauce. Shrimp was flavorful, and the grits were well-cooked. I enjoyed it! I'm glad I spoke up and ended up with an entree I was happy with. "
,,,,,I also got some orange and cranberry mimosas which were delightful and came with an ample amount of champagne. Highly recommend those!
,,,,,It was an OK experience. The spicy chicken sandwich and fries were good but nothing special. If you go on a weekend the restaurant is very loud with parties and loud music.
,,,,,"I like the atmosphere, various types of seating arrangements, music , food and the service. Parking is free and a short walk away."
,,,,,First time in Houston and picked this as the first restaurant to check out. Everything was absolutely amazing. Food perfection and drinks were done exactly right
,,,,,"I've been here a few times over the last year and I've figured that your experience really depends on when you go. Brunch is fun, the setting is great and they'll open up the garage-style doors when it's nice. Brunch also has good selection of dishes, though their ""signature"" (waiter's word) dishes like the chilaquiles were not very flavorful (and soggy) and the fruity pebble french toast was much sweeter than anticipated (and we definitely anticipated it). But I think the brunch cocktails are great! During the week, availability is not so crazy and the happy hour specials seem great. However each time we've gone to happy hour, and early enough, we're told that at least two items from the food and drink menu aren't available (we've gone to try the short rib grilled cheese three times and still haven't been able to). So far, there isn't an appetizer we've tried and haven't liked - during both brunch and weekly menus. As someone who doesn't really like fries, I always order theirs (crunchy outside, soft inside). But as someone who always order Brussels sprouts, I don't order them here (way too much crumbled bacon, not-melted-enough cheese, and soggy sprouts). The kale salad is delicious and the shaved pork chop sandwich is different but tasty. Overall, I think ambience beats the food, but you can find really good dishes to stick with that'll keep you returning."
,,,,,This place is awesome!!! The hostess was super friendly when we arrived. Our awesome waiter Sam was very knowledgeable about the menu and helped us make some very good decisions for our brunch. All the food was delicious but the totchos are worth coming back to Houston for. Thank you Sam for the great experience.
,,,,,"Food was great. We didn't have a reservation but we're seated pretty quickly. However, we weren't big fans of the drinks. I believe it's because  we're not big whiskey drinkers. I would wish for a variety of drinks like one or two. Other than that, we still enjoyed our food. Service was also great!"
,,,,,Very nice location. Were still seated even though we were 10minutes late. The greeting desk and our server was a delight. Our food didn't take long to come out. It was a good vibe
,,,,,"Now this is a place to go to for brunch. Everything was absolutely amazing. There was a long wait, even with Covid. I waited about 45 mins to get a table but so worth the wait! What attracted me to this place was seeing pictures of the fruity pebbles french toast and wow it's a must get item! They put condensed milk on it and it's definitely a game changer. All the food we ordered was great and the service as well. Our server was amazing, she was so nice and checked up on my table frequently even when the restaurant was so busy"
,,,,,"Went to Bosscat a few years back and had a lackluster experience but, decided to go with the flow when a friend picked this place for their birthday. "
,,,,,"Love the indoor outdoor option that opens their ""garage"" doors and lets you sit near there instead of all the way inside.  Definitely helped to curb my covid anxiety. "
,,,,,"The drinks were okay, not anything to write home about. The appetizers were pretty good including the Buffalo chicken dip and the pig candy, which was their play on cracklins. I ended up getting the short rib as my main entree. Well, honestly we all did because it seemed to be the best option on the menu. It didn't disappoint, it was tender flavorful and a pretty generous portion."
,,,,,"Overall, Bosscat is pretty good. I wish their whiskey beverages were better considering they boast on being a whiskey bar but otherwise, I'd go back - for the short rib anyway."

,,,,,"The food was probably really good but it was too rich for my taste. Very heavy meat and potatoes style. Everything we tried was bursting with flavor. Unfortunately, the pork chop was very dry. If you decide to eat here you better be very hungry. 12 Hour Beef Short Rib, Red Velvet Churros, Fried Apple Pie!  "
,,,,,"Service was great, but I have to take this place down a notch because I was expecting more of a fine dining kind of experience. It was more like a fancy sports bar. Lots of screens playing. It was so dark we couldn't read the menu. Not kid friendly.  Music was too loud. Saw the high rating and thought it was worth a try. It was but probably won't be back any time soon."
,,,,,Uuummmmm idk.. maybe it was because I only ordered sides. I wasn't necessarily impressed. Right now yall have me giving a strong side eye. Im not sure about the rest of the menu but if your sides arent stand alone THROW THE WHOLE MENU AWAY!!!!!!! Fix it Bosscat Fix it!!!!! I will update my review once I have a main dish but right now 3/5 is all I can muster.
,,,,,"Excellent service and food! Whiskey Okra a must!!! Very friendly staff, good atmosphere and location. Must try it if near the area."
,,,,,"Solid go-to brunch or whiskey lover spot. Their most popular food items are the fruity pebbles french toast and the donut burger! I'm not much of an Instagram foodie anymore, so we ordered the not as cute options: short rib chilaquiles (pictured in front), shrimp and grits (not pictured) and smokehouse Benedict (pictured in back). "
,,,,,Drinks are bomb. They have a whiskey wall/room with so many options. We got a few rounds of mimosa carafes for the table and a wake up call.
,,,,,"One thing to note: they can be very pushy about the 1.5-2hr time limit (which is allowed and totally understandable!! However, they reminded us several times - on the phone during reservation, on the phone to confirm day of, when seated, and 10 minutes after ordering). We were well under the time but felt rushed, so 1 star off for that."
,,,,,"I'll definitely be back for brunch, and hopefully I won't feel as rushed next time bc the food and ambiance is great!"
,,,,,"Been here twice and this place has delivered each time. Brunch was excellent and dinner service delivers as well. The only thing meh was the fries. Everything else, the chicken, pasta, risotto was on point. Will be back."
,,,,,"I so love the location and the set up of the Resturant. Very rustic and yet it gives you an upscale vibe. Huge on the inside and have whiskey/beer tasting as well. I have no complaints about my order except for my cup of lemons had lipstick on the rim of the glass definitely not ideal especially with COVID. One of the apps I ordered was very dry and was missing something inside the pulled pork hush puppies, the dipping sauce that paired with it was not well. I ordered scalloped potatoes and seems like I received a fried has brown. The taste was amazing but the look I was expecting didn't come. "
,,,,,On the flip side the fried oysters were amazing it reminded me of homemade fried food the crust on the outside was flavorful. My short ribs was definitely delicious soft tender and flavorful. The risotto was the bestselling thing in my opinion. Then for desert the fried apple pie made my eyes roll because it was sooooooo amazing. I had an amazing brunch experience.
,,,,,"Drink: The Bosslady wild turkey bourbon, citrus, seasonal berries, flowers. It was delicious and refreshing especially since I am a whiskey novice. "
,,,,,"Appetizer: fried oysters with comeback sauce. The oysters were amazing, fried to perfection and the comeback sauce was excellent. "
,,,,,Crispy fried chicken sandwich and Mac and cheese. I loved the chicken. It was flavorful and seasoned well. The Mac and cheese was very cheesy and creamy. 
,,,,,Very good first experience! I'll be back for happy hour soon.
,,,,,So I came back as John Reed requested and the manager EJ. These mimosas was the truth Lord  me and my sister is feeling real good. The food was awesome and we really enjoyed ourselves. I would recommend this place and will be back.
,,,,,"The food wasn't good at all... $9.00 for two eggs, craft mimosas $30 oh no. The eggs wasn't even shell eggs, the server was dry as hell. The experience wasn't pleasant at all the only thing was valet parking. I paid $60 for brunch never again"
,,,,,This place was so good! I came here with my girls on a Sunday for brunch. We got a carafe that easily serves enough for 4 people to have 2 rounds. 
,,,,,"We got the mushroom chillaquille, which were to die for. But not only that the totchos were "
,,,,,"If you go, you have to get the fruit pebbles French toast with ice cream! All the portion sizes were big as well and easily shareable. "

,,,,,You know what I love better than good food? Great customer service. Last evening I went back to one of my favorite spots Bosscat for a quick bite and drinks before I hit the town. I ordered the 12 hour short rib meal. In short there was way more cheese in those scallop potatoes than necessary. The manager came over after the meal and asked about it. I shared my feedback. He shared from the looks the food wasn't prepared to their standards. He took care of it for me. I have had many great meals here and the service is always excellent. We also continued to drink and drink some more. Here are a few recommendations of libations from last night we had to get your evening started:
,,,,,the bosscat * the bosslady * the good life * wouldn't you
,,,,,"Scene: Saturday night. I'm looking for a new place. Up pops Bosscat. The ambiance is pretty jumpin' this place is doing it all for really reasonable price. As soon as you walk in there's a DJ who is spinning a really good mix playlist through the decades. If you're a fan of good music you'll love it. It's probably best to make a reservation unless it's you and a friend then you may grab a seat at the bar. If it's more about the scene, this is pretty upscale casual. Good enough to bring a date, fun enough for a large crowd, relaxed enough to be in a t-shirt and grab a drink with your friends. The food is really good. I recommend the shaved pork chop"
,,,,,Sandwich pairs with a side. It's more than enough food. Grab a cocktail and let the good times roll.
,,,,,The Good:
,,,,,"We self parked on the street for free and walked less than five minutes to the door. We had a reservation I booked last minute for 8:45 as the earliest they had available. But we showed up at 8 and were seated immediately. My husband LOVES bourbon and we were seated along the Whiskey Room wall so we were able to gawk at the collection they have. We wanted to have some Pappy 10 yr, but they were out. So he went with an Old Fashioned and it was good. We had the ahi tuna lettuce wraps as a starter and they were DELICIOUS!!! I made a note to self that I will make a meal of those next visit. My husband had the catfish and subbed the risotto for a plank of potatoes that he thoroughly enjoyed....very yummy. "
,,,,,The bad:
,,,,,"When we arrived I stepped up to the hostess stand where three employees were standing and talking amongst themselves and there was a very awkward moment where they stopped talking and turned to me silently until one them finally and very flatly asked ""can I help you?"" I won't take  time explaining how the exchange went but it wasn't good by any means. But I think the overly loud music and very dim lighting may have contributed to the uneasy exchange, because the entire time we were there the only way to communicate was to low-yell everything you had to say or lean in very close so you can hear. Once seated we were given free water that was SO Houston... very bleachy."
,,,,,The ugly:
,,,,,"I ordered the shaved pork sandwich and the Bosscat fries. The stuff on the sandwich was a crunchy, dry and flavorless mystery. I gave up on the sandwich because it was just gross. I filled up on the fries which were not like any fries I've ever had before. They were huge wedges with a greasy crispy outer crust that I didn't enjoy at all. I was very sad sitting there with my meal watching my husband go nom nom nom on his catfish. "
,,,,,We skipped dessert because I was bummed. But we will visit again. Those lettuce wraps are calling my name. And we're always on the hunt for some Pappy!! 
,,,,,Apologies for not taking piks...next time
,,,,,"I low this restaurant is amazing! The food, my bartender Omar.....all the best! Ask for him the next time you stop in! He makes the best everything.  We had the short rib chilaquiles and the breakfast burrito AMAZING!!! Come and try and make sure to ask for Omar!"
,,,,,"The food was amazing. Very nice restaurant. Loved it. Very organized,  2 hour limit. That seasoning was the best I've tasted since covid.  I will definitely go back. Make sure you request sitting area."
,,,,,"Top spot for quality American food. Great location to chill, eat some good food. . Ample seating inside and out. Friendly, knowledgeable staff is accommodating and ready with suggestions should you request. The food is absolutely spectacular. "
,,,,,"The food is fresh! We had a burger ""the chef's way"" and let me tell you. It wax a mix of flavors that all come together as a sparkling symbiosis. "
,,,,,"The staff is very helpful, attentive and at the service of their clients. They have a special policy to help you if you feel unsafe."
,,,,,There is so much more to say! I will be back and I highly recommend this restaurant!!
,,,,,This is a really cool place to hang out indeed
,,,,,"Aside from Octavio the angry bartender, dinner and drinks (with the other bartender Brandon) were awesome. We had the fried oysters (da bomb!!), ahi tuna wraps (mmmm), friend chicken sammich' and the sugar glazed steak. All the food was excellent. Essentially if you don't get Octavio, 10 outa 10."
,,,,,"I came back to provide an update of photos. My rating remains the same, I will always recommend Bosscat for brunch in Houston. The photos I added for are from the two recent times that I went. The short rib chilaquiles were just OK, nothing really wow about them. They just weren't flavorful to me. But the star of the show is the vegetable omelette. I know it sounds super simple but it was so good. From the goat cheese, to the toast, to the micro greens it was excellent. I always appreciate when restaurants do simple items so well. Again, if you're visiting Houston or just looking for a new brunch spot make sure to give Bosscat a try!"
,,,,,"Visited around 8:30PM on a Friday night. We had a 45-1 hour wait for a table for 4. Very nice aesthetic. Music was too loud, even our waiters had a tough time hearing our orders. Drinks were very strong and prices are on the expensive side. We has the Boss Lady, Whiskey Sour and Southsider. We also tried the B&B burger and Bosscat fries. Both were delicious and had big portions. Staff was nice and waiters were very knowledgeable about the menu."
,,,,,Yet again another amazing dinning experience at Bosscat. The wife and i don't get to come out often with the three toddlers at home but today is our anniversary so we came to our ho to play tonight. The food was amazing the drinks were on point and they even went above and beyond and gave us two glasses of champagne to celebrate our night. Thank you to the whole team for a Making our night so special
,,,,,Came here for the first time tonight and i will definitely be coming back and recommending this place. Terry was amazing and we loved the ambiance.....  not to mention they have 260 different types of whiskey #SassyMesero
,,,,,This place is a complete and total hidden gem. I love the staff and management. I even love the sister companies they have! I would definitely recommend this place for any occasion.
,,,,,"Great service, great drinks, great atmosphere and very good and unique menu. I can't imagine striking out here unless management changes. This is a must go to."

,,,,,"I like the food here. I have been recently for brunch and lunch. I do prefer brunch because the food choices are a bit healthier. For brunch, I had avocado toast, egg whites, and turkey sausage. It was all spectacular. I do wish they had coffee drinks, but they do serve Katz Coffee. It is good, but it was $5.00, which we thought was pretty expensive, especially since I had only one cup. It is a bar scene so it's casual and always noisy. Don't come here expecting a nice place for quiet conversation. Service is ok, but because it is a busy and crowded restaurant, service is spotty. There is valet parking and the parking lot is a bit small and busy. The valets are actually very nice and polite. It has a nice vibe and it is a fun place to go."
,,,,,"As I'm in the middle of eating my 12 hour slow cooked short rib with scalloped potatoes, fried onions and roasted green beans -- I thought to myself: ""damn! I  miss this place already"" "
,,,,,"Originally from New York and decided to disappear for a while and explore the grounds of Houston. Bosscat did not disappoint. Our waitress was very nice! I forgot her name but she's pretty, skinny brown skinned lady with locs.  "
,,,,,My sis got their shrimp and grits and couldn't done raving about how flavorful it was. We missed brunch by 30 mins but we can't wait to come back!
,,,,,"Im torn but in all fairness i think its me. This place is nice, i love the atmosphere. Its laid back and relax. Looks like an really family friendly place to go and enjoy. I ordered a boss lady cocktail, my friend and i shared the short ribs and we both had a desset. The cocktail was good i would definitely come back during happy hour to try some other drinks.  The short ribs were a tad salty for me. The desserts were also not my cup of tea.  The manderian cake tasted like s pancake and the red velvet churros were dry. Again,  my personal preference so it may taste different to someone else. I would cone back for the drinks but i would pass on the food."
,,,,,"So I went this past Saturday , and I believe brunch was already over that's what I really wanted . So we decided to still give it a try , The location is nice if you love whiskey this is the place to come too , they have gorgeous private rooms full of whiskey bottles For special occasions . My friend had a burger with homemade fries , I had Cajun brick chicken but I wasn't really feeling the dirty rice it was super mushy to me it was ehh . But I sent it back and just got a burger instead it was delicious. We also had a few drinks I believe it was called the good life !! oh yeah we also had a appetizer dip it was okay I believe it's a twist of Buffalo chicken dip . I will definitely be back to try the brunch I've heard so much about !"
,,,,,"Excellent. We chose Bosscat for a dinner for 49-50 people as part of a wedding celebration. Comments from the attendees were uniformly positive - food, service, liquor selection. As the host, I very much appreciated the attention to detail and deliciousness of the appetizer, salads, pasta, fish, and beef ribs. The desserts - chocolate churros, s'mores bars, and hot chocolate with add ins were yummy. "
,,,,,"Management and server attention to guest needs were great. If I ever have another event in Houston, this would be my first choice for a meal venue. "
,,,,,Thanks PJ and crew for a great evening.
,,,,,"This place is amazing. Got the shrimp & grits and apple cheese cake waffle. I don't even like cheese cake but the graham crackers and apples made it amazing. The shrimp and grits is different, using tomato based sauce, but it was very good as well."
,,,,,"The service was really great here! I enjoyed the fruity pebble French toast, sausage, and eggs. I sat outside and they provided a umbrella. I have nothing bad to say about the place or service. Thank you all!"
,,,,,"The food , staff, prices, everything  just top notch !!"
,,,,,Couldn't recommend enough.  Menu had just about something for everyone.  Even the Happy hour menu had more than several choices for our party of 5.  After we got half way through our food... we wanted to try even more food of the menu.  Drinks were great !!
,,,,,Who'd of thought Moscow Mules on tap ?  Bosscat set the bar pretty high for what you can expect in the area.
,,,,,Do NOT get the hush puppies. They are bland and the sauce is nasty! The atmosphere is amazing and the drinks are delicious!
,,,,,"Bosscat knocked it out of the park again. Tried the portobello fries, 12 hour rib and red velvet churros. All were amazing! I loved the portobello fries with the spicy jalapeño dip. The 12 hour short rib was amazinggggg. So tender and went really well with the mashed potatoes. The churros were really good too, but I ate them after they had already gotten cold. I bet hot, they are the bomb! Also had the boss lady with the meal and it was refreshing and such a cute drink. Can't wait to come back and try more :)"
,,,,,Love Bosscat! What a great brunch spot. The interior is so cute and they have an awesome whiskey room you can rent out. I was worried about parking but there's a free garage right next to it so it was really easy to get there.
,,,,,The donut burger is delicious! The sweet goes so well with the savory. The burger with a regular bun would have been delicious. I ate the whole thing lol
,,,,,My friend had the smokehouse Benedict and it was so good! It was a ton of food! 
,,,,,Everything was delicious and I'd love to go back to try more of the brunch menu. They had so many great options! The vibe and atmosphere is just awesome.

,,,,,Huge shout out to Marissa for taking care of us 
,,,,,Find me a better place and I'll go there!!!
,,,,,This place out in Houston was alright! The vibes were nice and chill. We got to sit outside on the patio. It has a bar inside and there's this cute floral wall at the entrance! The menu is simple but didn't have many options or anything that really stood out that would make me want to try it. 
,,,,,I'm a fan of Brussels sprouts ever since I had some in slc at white horse so I try to try them everywhere I go! 
,,,,,The Brussels sprouts were okay don't think I'd get them again. They did have Parmesan cheese on them which gave them a bit more flavor but if there wasn't any cheese on them they were whatever's. 
,,,,,The burger was good! Nice and juicy! Can never go wrong with a burger! 
,,,,,Our server was great! For how busy it was we did not have bad service! 
,,,,,Overall it was okay. Don't think I'd come for food. Maybe for the atmosphere.
,,,,,"Great food. Our server was very accommodating & was very patient with our large group! Hostess could have been a little nicer, but I understand when large groups make last minute changes things can get hectic. Will be back again!"
,,,,,"So many great things about Bosscat!!! The service was absolutely perfect! Our server, Maylet, was so great with her ability to answer my menu questions and communicate with the chef my dietary concerns and he came out with the perfect meal for me. (And he came to our table to make sure it was right). All four of us LOVED our food choices. Portions were also great for the price. Our drinks were always attended to and dirty dishes were quickly removed.  Tables were far enough apart to feel comfortable during Covid or just to have conversational privacy. The outdoor area is really nice, too.  We will be back often for sure."
,,,,,"Absolutely awesome spot. Came into town on a tour (I do music) and this was the cap to my Texas run. Bosscat was exactly what I was looking for. Awesome food, great whiskey, knowledgeable service, clean bathrooms, GOOD HOT SAUCE, etc etc etc. Fries are phenomenal and I can highly recommend the chicken dip app and the chicken sandwich. Great casual spot in Galleria. Will definitely be back. Thanks Matt for the fantastic hospitality!"
,,,,,"Went to Bosscat with a few friends to catch up. The atmosphere on a Friday night was rather lively and my drink at the bar was pretty good (Kentucky Orange Blossom - buffalo trace, orange, elderflower, bitters)! "
,,,,,"We ordered the Porkbelly Poutine to start (which was pretty good, especially the bits of porkbelly)! Then I had an order of the 12 hour beef short rib and the meat was so silky soft with a peppery sauce. It was great!"
,,,,,Visited during covid. Quite busy but they manage to distance tables and all servers are properly masked. Enjoyed my entree immensely. Had the smokehouse Benedict and swapped the pork for chicken. Yum yum. Perfectly cooked.
,,,,,This is more a bar than restaurant. The food choices are limited and the music is pretty loud. I wouldn't recommend it unless you're there for the drinks. They seemed to have a pretty wide variety.  What we ordered was pricey but tasty. Parking was easy as it's a strip. Maybe there are more weekday food options.
,,,,,The bad: 
,,,,,"The hostess. Walking up to the restaurant, I had some casual conversation with someone who turned out to be the hostess while she was sweeping away water due to the recent downpour of rain. I walked in and waited for someone to approach the hostess desk to be seated. Hostess comes inside and decides to take care of the folks who walked in behind me. Some advice: pay attention to your patrons. Fool me once, shame on you. "
,,,,,More bad:
,,,,,"The hostess BSing. When I asked her for details on the whisky library, she replied with ""it's for private party only."" I find out from one of the bartenders that it's okay to walk in to check it out. Fool me twice, still shame on you. "
,,,,,Still bad: 
,,,,,"The water. Sat at the bar and asked for water to go with my choice of bourbon. It tasted like chlorine. Not sure if this is a Houston thing but don't drink tap, especially from here. I told one of the bartenders about how it tastes bad and he just blankly stares at me. And every time I try to chat them up, they gave robotic responses and seemed mentally checked out. It wasn't busy either.  Fool me thrice...y'all are seriously slacking."
,,,,,"Lastly, the good: "
,,,,,"The HRW food options. Well, some of them. The presentation for all 3 dishes were top notch. "
,,,,,Course 1 - Tuna Wonton: solid. 
,,,,,Course 2 - Honey Barrel Korean BBQ Ribs - delicious. A bit too much on the egg noodles but that's more on me since I'm a leave-nothing-on-the-plate kind of guy. Momma raised me well. 
,,,,,Course 3 - Boba Bomb. It's not your typical boba as it's tapioca pudding so it's really false advertising. The pudding and fruits made me want to lick the plate clean but the cream puff was a bit dry and seemed stale. 
,,,,,"Overall, I would go back to try more of their food options but the people needs to step up their game if they want to stand out in the Houston food  scene. Instead, I'll go check out Reserve 101 and Permission for whiskey and support other establishments on the HRW list."
,,,,,"Definitely good service and ambience if you like a younger trendy crowd. Not sure how the food here has rave reviews?! It's pretty mediocre at best. (Maybe those that find seasoning other than black pepper ""spicy"" think otherwise... ) We found the food to be bland and underwhelming.  The portions are also not congruent with pricing. I guess it depends on how high your standards are. The bar does offer a nice variety of specialty cocktails so it's a great place for drinks. With somewhat pricey offerings, their happy hour selections aren't very robust. If you're a foodie I suggest you plan for bites elsewhere."

,,,,,Very cool place to eat and drink.  Highly recommend taking family here for Brunch.  Two hour table limit which means you will not have a ridiculous wait time.
,,,,,I came here for the first time and I would totally come back again. Henry was our server and he was very attentive and overall great service!
,,,,,I always see this place on Yelp but pass it up & today I decided to stop in. I started off with The Good Life cocktail & it was pretty tasty! I know this is a whiskey bar but I'm a vodka girl so this was perfect! I also decided on the burger to eat & was not disappointed it was cooked & season to perfection! Unfortunately fries don't come with this so I ordered a side of fries yummmm!! Sooo good! The hostess & wait staff were all super friendly & welcoming. I think I'd give them another shot :)
,,,,,From the moment I walked in I was completely blown away. The hospitality was beyond amazing! Service was outstanding from several employees who attended us. I knew I wanted to come back before I had even tried the food. Once I did I was even more impressed! I highly recommend brunch here!
,,,,,There's a long wait for Sunday brunch so make sure you have a reservation. 
,,,,,Service is friendly and within appropriate time but the food was neither here nor there. Went with a bunch of friends and we ordered a number of items but the best was the tater tots appetizer.
,,,,,Get to this place early it gets packed. It was a roomy place spacious and large bar. They also have an outside 
,,,,,I sat at the bar. They have a nice variety of drink and a happy from 3-5. Although you really need a drink after 5 but I guess for the retired crowd near River Oaks?
,,,,," I had the Dream, it is a fruity bubbly drink, is was delish. The coffee was burnt and tasted bitter even with cream and sugar. Perhaps someone left it on the pot to long. I love love coffee, I drink it black. So this was a shame for me."
,,,,,We had the Smoked Hash Benedict. The sauce was great and the eggs were perfect. Touch of spice and the potatoes were crispy. That dish needed a bit more sauce and the smoked meat and potatoes were dry with no season. It needed a touch more salt and pepper.
,,,,,"The pork chilequiles were good, chips were crispy, enough sauce and the egg was cooked perfectly.  I would go back to explore what else is on the menu."
,,,,,Placed a reservation over the phone 5 days in advance. Called 2hrs before the reservation to confirm . Showed up at my reservation time and was told that there was no record of my calling and that I must have called the wrong business. After showing them the records of my calls on my phone they were about to move a chair to a six top for my party of seven. But it was maid very clear that they don't move chairs normally. Unfortunately our reservation time was right at the end of their brunch shift. And we went without a waiter checking on us for almost 30 minutes. There was no communication that we would be getting a new waiter or even that our waiter was leaving. 
,,,,,The drinks were good. The appetizers were great. The food was alright. Might try it again for evening cocktails but the experience put a bad taste in my mouth
,,,,,Hands down the best brunch experience I've ever had. 
,,,,,"We ordered food: shrimp and grits, pancake breakfast and chicken fried steak & libations: bosscat Bloody Mary,"
,,,,,"breakfast shot, the wake up call, and the bubbles cocktail. "
,,,,,"Our experience guide, Jerry, provided a transformative experience. His service is now the standard by which i will measure my experiences henceforth. "
,,,,,4310 Westheimer Rd
,,,,,The manager greeted us and made sure everyone's experience was pleasant. The space was very well thought out and created the ultimate vibe. It is evident that every singe aspect of this culinary treasure is both curated and cultivated. 
,,,,,Thank you for such an amazing birthday brunch
,,,,,Great atmosphere! Light bites were great as was desert. Need to come back again! Wait staff were wonderful.
,,,,,"Go here for the drinks. . . . not the food.  We went here for dinner for the first time the other night and was not impressed with the food or the service.  We started off with drinks . . . The Panama Prescription and The Boss lady.  Drinks were good.  For an appetizer we got the Pork Belly Poutine which was French Fries, Pork Belly, Cheese Curds and Andouille Gravy. . . It just didn't work for us.  Not sure why they put Cheese Curds in this concoction.  Entrees we got the Carolina BBQ Salmon which was Salmon with BBQ Sauce on top of a butterbean Succotash.  I ate the Salmon which was ok and completely laid off of the Succotash . . . . here again it just did not work for me.  The Wife got the 12 Hour beef short ribs. Dessert - I got the Blueberry Buttermilk Pie.  The crust was hard and dry. . . . we just got the feeling the food was not the focal point of this establishment.  Service was subpar . . . we were always looking for the waitress who for the most part was nowhere to be seen.  What might have been the problem is that they had a huge party going on in the back.  Could be they were just overwhelmed?  I would go back to the bar to have a few drinks after work but would order a hamburger instead of there entree's."

,,,,,"Great ambiance, the general decor and vibe was great overall. Went on a Saturday and it was a little busy, though we had reservations and were sat pretty quick though. The brunch menu is great and alot of the other items I saw looked good. Overall the service was good but sometimes it took a bit to get someone's attention, other than that staff was friendly."
,,,,,"The music is Loud, very loud.  I was looking forward to having several things on the menu but they weren't offered on the limited  lunch menu. Disappointing. Won't go there again."
,,,,,I really enjoyed my time here! Right from the very beginning the hostess was so nice ! I had my baby with me and they sat me where other ppl had children too which I appreciated as a new mom I don't want to disturb others but a girl gots to get out too! I ordered the fruity pebble French toast and it was amazing! Topped with ice cream! I wasn't drinking so they suggested the prickly pear and this mock tail was so good I had multiple! 
,,,,,Then to top it off the jams! The music was bumping! I wanted to come to this place for years and I'm so glad I finally got to come
,,,,,Casual spot to watch sport and whiskey tastings. Dishes are deep rich flavorful. I enjoyed a late night craving
,,,,,"Everything was top notch! Great staff, and the food was immaculate."
,,,,,Thinking about an appetizer? Get the pig candy. Don't even think further about it. 
,,,,,"Also, the rib was super tender and delicious, but the cornmeal crusted catfish was absolutely fire!"
,,,,,Great place for a drink after work. Grilled cheese brisket sandwich which is a must. Also their burger chefs eat and mushroom fries are delicious
,,,,,"Great service, delicious food and amazing whiskey selections. PJ, Gavin, Will, Daniel, and all the rest will make you feel at home on your visit!"
,,,,,"Came to Bosscat for brunch. I'm from DC so this was my first time at the establishment. We were taken care of so well! Flor was a great server; she was very attentive and personable. Next time I come into town, I'll definitely come back to visit!"
,,,,,"Again, this is our first time coming here from out of state. The atmosphere in Bosscat is very romantic and relaxing even though there were plenty of people inside eating! It's a great place to eat for date night or dinner with friends. My boyfriend and I sat very close to the kitchen at a high top table and were given complimentary extra chips by the chef to go with our chicken dip appetizer (very good). My boyfriend ordered the steak and I got the catfish. My catfish was AMAZING, the risotto was creamy, fish was crispy and everything went well with the sweet/spicy sauce that came on top. I would give this place 5 stars without a thought if my boyfriends steak came out well the FIRST time. He had to send it back initially because it was verryyy overcooked and tough even though he ordered it medium well. They quickly remade his food, which was moist and flavorful the second time around. My only complaint was the waitress we had made it seem like it was his fault his steak was overcooked. She never apologized for his food being chewy and dried out which we did not appreciate! Otherwise, the food and service was great. I would still return here or recommend to a friend!"
,,,,,Happened upon this little gem when I was in Houston this past weekend. Shrimp and Grits were the best I've ever had. A+

,,,,,"A mixed bag of feelings about this place. Overall ok, but not somewhere I'd come again."
,,,,,"We got there when they first opened and asked for a table, saying the rest of our party was about 10min away. The hostess was a little snotty imo saying she could seat us but that she would start a timer on us and if we used up the time, they'd ask us to leave. We were a little taken back and said oh we better wait to which she replied well if another party of 5 comes, then you can't have a table until another opens up. This while their tables were all literally empty. I get that you have reservations, but have some level of tact. Our party arrived a few min later and we asked for a table and the hostess literally didn't believe our party was here and then repeated that while she could give us a high top, they had a time limit and that they would ask us to leave if we exceeded it. I can not roll my eyes more. They never filled up the entire time we were there."
,,,,,"The food was mostly ok, but some of it didn't work."
,,,,,"The avacado toast was visually appealing, but had no taste. They literally slathered the avocado on, cut some cherry tomatoes on it and sprinkled some greens. The egg I added on for 2.5 was good and had some salt and pepper on it though. Definitely disappointing."
,,,,,The tatchos were pretty good. Whatever cheese chorizo mix they had on it was a good mixture Warning that this dish is very salty though. I asked for some chow chow ketchup having read about it on the menu and they silently charged 50 cents for it. 
,,,,,"The donut burger didn't work for me. The donut itself was sweet and tasted fine, but there is the salty wetness underneath from the burger portion that made it really unpleasant."
,,,,,"The red velvet chorizo were softer than expected, but overall decent. The dip was good too. My family and friends across the board didn't like the rest of the dishes ordered: the roasted chilaquiles, the pancake breakfast, the chicken fried steak. They found the pancake dish too watery from the eggs and didn't like the dryness of meat and the way the breading slid off. "
,,,,,Then came the nasty part. My friend was drinking water and discovered her napkin had some chewed gum embedded in it. They comped her meal and brought an apple cheesecake waffle as an apology. 
,,,,,The apple cheesecake waffle was easily the best dish we had. The whipped cream was so light and sweet!
,,,,,"Aside from the initial encounter with the hostess, everyone else was so friendly and polite. In retrospect, it's not really her fault this place has a timer policy and has more reservations than people who actually show."
,,,,,I'll be writing about my experiences for both brunch and regular lunch/dinner + drinks here.
,,,,,"I made reservations (highly recommended as this place does get busy and is packed! Especially for brunch). Though I made reservations for the lunch/dinner service during a week day and it was not that busy at the time my girlfriends and I stopped by, but it did steadily get busier as time went on.  When we were seated, our waiter was polite and friendly and made some great recommendations on drinks. I prefer a more sweet cocktail without much of the taste of alcohol; the alcohol that creeps on you. Anyway, I ordered for appetizers the pork belly poutine, mac and cheese, fried broccolini, spicy chicken + cheese dip, and whiskey okra (this was of course shared amongst my girlfriends and I). The pork belly poutine was okay. The pork belly was deliciously flavorful and tender, but the steak fries were what turned me off some to the entirety of the dish. It was still good, but it wasn't my favorite app. The whiskey okra and the fried broccolini were pretty good. The flavoring/sauce drenched over the vegetables were good and made the plain tasting vegetables pop in flavor. My favorite app though, would have had to been the spicy chicken + cheese dip. It reminded me of a buffalo chicken cheese dip, but better. It was so warm and gooey, and the homemade potato chips went perfectly with each bite. This app is probably now my go-to whenever I visit this place again."
,,,,,"For the main meal, I ordered the steak. I love me a good, juicy steak. The steak was large and cooked medium rare - how any steak should be eaten in my opinion. The fatty pieces of the steak were succulent and I did enjoy every bite, but I only ate so much just because I had a plethora of appetizers. A mistake on my end, but that's okay. I still enjoyed it regardless and had plenty of left overs to take home for my boyfriend to try. Though I did enjoy the steak, I believe I'll be trying another entree next time around."
,,,,,"The second time that I came here was for the brunch service. This place is usually booked up two weeks in advance, so I was lucky enough to catch an open reservation time a week in advance. I've been wanting to try the fruity pebbles French toast (which is their iconic brunch item). But they also had other delicious options as well. The great thing about having a S/O is that they can order something that you like, and you can order something different, and share, so you essentially get the best of both worlds when going out to eat because you can try a bit of everything. So my boyfriend actually ordered the fruity pebble French toast and I ordered the chilaquiles. It was absolutely divine. The fruity pebbles satisfied my sweet tooth (though it was incredibly sweet, so drink that water!) and the chilaquiles was savory to balance out the sweetness of the French toast. Both meals were equally appetizing and aesthetically pleasing, but the French toast was of course more colorful. I couldn't be able to decide between the two of which I liked more; they were both just wonderfully yummy. "
,,,,,"I definitely plan on coming back here to try out more of their drink menu and order other entrees. I definitely recommend this for either brunch or dinner. The ambience is trendy and a lot of young people come. The staff is pleasant and polite. And the food is just amazing. So overall, both my experiences here were fantastic."
,,,,,Wonderful! Service was great. Food was impeccable. Definitely plan on making many more trips here. Drinks were just strong enough and ambience was A1. Nothing but good things to say!
,,,,,"This was a great choice from start to finish! Upon arriving the doors opened exactly at 11am with the manager welcoming everyone in with a smile, warmth and love. We were seated right away and the waiter Ava was amazing from the first hello; she made great recommendations and boy was she right about the cold but warming to the soul BC ice tea! (Yummy) and not to mention the breakfast shot; yes it's a shot of bourbon, oj and bacon on the side! (I know it's a must see and taste to believe) I was seated with a party of 7 and we ordered most of the menu (haha); (the menu is limited.. yup you guessed it due to Covid) anyway; the options available were amazing. We had the pancakes, chicken sausage, burrito, veggie omelette, fruity pebbles French toast, burger and fried chicken and some other stuff... I'm still full and probably won't eat for another day. LoL "
,,,,,"Anyway, everything was great, unique flavors, served hot, presented well and hearty. It was Valentine's Day so it was fairly packed. I have to add that I'm visiting from out of town but felt so at home at this restaurant, the manager and his wife were so friendly, funny and welcoming. He checked on our table and ensured service was amazing and it definitely was. ( thanks Ava) I will come back here again and can't wait until the entire menu is available. This is definitely a new favorite for me! Can't wait for my next visit!! Make sure to visit this spot, it's a must. Ohhhh and the atmosphere is so chic, rustic and trendy. Perfect for couples, family, friends and private events."
,,,,,2020 was a crazy awful year but at least my Thanksgiving dinner was amazing. We had great service from a wonderful young lady named Christina. We had a little chat with her while waiting for our fabulous dinner to arrive. Found out she's Cuban and came from Miami like me. 
,,,,,I also met another young Cuban guy who was very nice as well. Ok back to our bomb AF food. Check out the pics and menu of what they served. 
,,,,,Since the pandemic didn't let us get together with the family we decided to do our own thing for once in 24 years. No Regrets at all. I'm looking forward to my next holiday dinner.
,,,,,Went here for my husbands birthday.  The food was good but more of just ok.  Nothing to recommend to others.  Drinks were good but may not be back for a while
,,,,,"I've been to Bosscat a handful of times and it's always enjoyable. The servers and bartenders are friendly and the place has a chill fun energy, but with a sense of classiness. It's the type of place you want to go with friends for drinks after work, a date or for brunch (my favorite). The staff wear their masks properly which is much appreciated during this time."
,,,,,"Their cocktail menu has a variety of options that you can't go wrong with. They specialize in whiskey drinks for my fellow whiskey lovers. My favorite drink is the Boss Lady, or something like that. As far as food, I have only had their brunch, which is pretty delicious and filling!"
,,,,,"Also, they do have a small patio on the side and surprisingly, it's dog friendly!"
,,,,,Horrible service horrible food.  Literally watched a fight between the kitchen staff and the bar. So unprofessional and honestly was scared of the bearded chef.  Horrible experience can't wait for ownership to recognize the complete disrespect of their staff.
,,,,,"I don't know why it took us so long to come here! Rich flavors, cool vibe, and great service. Their cocktails are flavorful but not too sweet and they actually have a decent selection of wine for a whiskey bar! All the appetizers looked good so it was hard to choose but I can recommend the pig candy. Do yourself a favor and get the bosscat burger chef's way. Our waiter recommended the sweet chili sauce on the side of the catfish and I would agree. He was also super honest about the desserts and wouldn't let us order the ones that were overrated. Honesty goes a long way for me and he made our experience memorable. "
,,,,,I wanted to give it 4 stars because some sandwiches don't come with sides and none of the desserts really seemed worth our while BUT I'd be lying if I said we wouldn't be back.
,,,,,"This is a great spot for chilling with your friends. The people are extremely customer service, but super Cool. The drinks are on point...And the food is what it should be, delish. I tasted the catfish & grits, the pork with polenta and the short rib and I loved them all equally.  The portions were plenty, we could not finish them and I forgot we had the cornbread appetizer, which were extremely lite for cornbread, delicious but different. This a great spot to really unwind on a Friday after work..."

,,,,,"Went here for brunch Sunday. Nice ambience and very clean! Our waiter ""Jerry"" was super helpful and friendly. I ordered the red velvet churros as an appetizer and I loved them! For my entree I ordered the shrimp and grits...I was not a fan. The tomato based creole sauce was too much! It saturated the grits. Maybe next time just a dollop of this wild be better. The grits themselves what little I could taste on their own were ok. I've  had better. The eggs were good and the shrimp were as well. I ate the shrimp and eggs basically. Will try them again to taste more of their menu."
,,,,,"Came here for my birthday dinner and was severely disappointed. We had reservations and when we arrived we were seated promptly. Appx 15 mins later we had our order taken. It took over an hour for the food to even come out. I'm assuming it had to do something with the large party that was happening in the back, but that's still no excuse for the long wait. The food wasn't anything special either, it's nothing I'd come back for. This is more like a come after work and grab a couple drinks type of place vs a sit down dining option"
,,,,,"The service was great, parking was easy, and the restaurant has a really cool vibe and is probably great for larger groups. I didn't think any of the brunch items were anything special. "
,,,,,Fruity Pebbles French Toast (3/5) - Bagel-like bread with condensed milk and cereal sprinkled on top that looks good on Instagram. It's not too sweet but also isn't as good as regular french toast.
,,,,,Smokehouse Benedict (3/5) - Another decent but kind of bland menu option that didn't blow us away. It's missing something. 
,,,,,"Totchos (4/5) - These were the best thing we got, I definitely recommend getting them."
,,,,,The waiter didn't recommend some of the items we initially wanted so maybe I'll come back and give those a shot.
,,,,,In town for the SeaHawks game. The wife and I jumped in the Uber and what a great choice we made the staff are friendly and knowledgeable about there menus. The martini and old fashioned I got were right on point. The pig candy was full of flavors very impressive. Not just your normal flavors. Wil the bartender was awesome. His suggestion for drinks and food were spot on!
,,,,,"I liked my dish, brick chicken, but wouldn't visit again for dinner unless for somethinglikenedto it. I appreciate the kick of the jambalaya rice. I do want to go back for the brunch items. I've heard great things and have seen some yummy looking pics."
,,,,,"I must say I was shocked by our experience here. We went for my husband's 30th birthday dinner on a Tuesday night which was not busy at all. The waiter took about 15 minutes just to greet us. And then another 10 just to bring us water....Never were we asked if it was our first time here or anything. The food was okay but nothing too crazy and the same for the drinks we ordered. We were told that our fries would take a while because they were made but the cook did not like how they came out. Which we appreciated but they didn't even come out until after we were already basically don't with our meals. Although I would possibly try it again here for brunch as the reviews for brunch seem better than dinner here. They had a whiskey room which was cool to check out, but I guess we were expecting more. I would've loved to try a special drink made with whiskey or hear about a popular item on their menu something to have made our experience a little better."
,,,,,"Upscale ambiance, delectable dishes and drinks, professional and friendly staff. This is one of my new favorite restaurants."
,,,,,"I want to start by saying the only reason why I gave it a 5 star is because our server Jacklyn went above and beyond to make my experience better, I just lives off her energy. Food wise it was a 3/5 and I'll tell you why. I've never in my life ordered something and return it. I also don't like giving servers a hard time, but I gave her my feedback after she asked me how was it; my response was the Shrimp & Grits I ordered was not good at all. Usually if I don't like it, I'll probably just take it to go & probably never eat it or have them trash it. "
,,,,,"Okay, so when I tasted my shrimp & grits; my first reaction was like why is this tomato sauce so acidic & salty? And then when I took a few more bites I started to get a heartburn. At the same time the grits were thick and I'm not a fan of that, I like mine to be a bit creamy. In addition, my shrimps were small & for a $24 dish I expected the shrimp to be bigger. My server came to check on us and she can see the dissatisfaction on my face, so she asked me if I wanted something else. I told her no because I'm not one of those hard to please customers, she responded by saying ""I want to make your experience worth coming back"" that right there is the reason why I am giving this place a 5 star, so y'all thank her for that. "
,,,,,"I went ahead and ordered the Carolina BBQ salmon, the fish was cooked perfectly, pink & glistening in the inside. My spinach complemented the salmon; I didn't really enjoy the BBQ sauce, so next time I'll just ask them not to put it on. I will say that I enjoyed my salmon 10 times more than the shrimp & grits. I'm not a chef but my advice is whoever is the chef needs to reevaluate that tomato sauce because it was out of line. It literally overpowered the entire dish. "
,,,,,"Overall AMAZING service, I enjoyed the salmon but not the shrimp & grits. At the end, Jacklyn was so sweet & brought us out a couple of complementary mini donuts to make up for the food, that was such a nice gesture. Will I come back? Yes."
,,,,,"After my first visit to Bosscat on a weekday, John, the owner, reached out to me to come try out their brunch. He was kind enough to make a reservation and the meal was on the house. After this visit, I definitely would come back for brunch on a weekend. "
,,,,,"I got a mimosa, the mushroom chilaquiles, and of course, the infamous fruity pebbles French toast to split with my boyfriend. Mimosa was good, when is not good? Haha the chilaquiles was good, but not something I would come back for again and again. The showstopper was definitely the French toast. We were able to get the bacon on the side since I'm a vegetarian, but damn, it was so good. Definitely recommend the ice cream on top if you get it! I would definitely come back for that yummyness. "
,,,,,"All in all, it was a great experience from food, to service, and ambiance. I definitely would come back for brunch on weekends. Wish they could serve the French toast on weekdays!"
,,,,,"Was excited to try this place mainly for the fruity pebbles French toast, but then I got there, and they said they don't do brunch on weekdays. Was pretty disappointed. As a vegetarian, the options were kind of slim. I ended up getting the mushroom and Brussels sprout flatbread. It was really mediocre, wouldn't got back for it. The crust was basically pita bread, there was minimal cheese, and the veggies were minced giving it a really weird flavor and texture. All in all, not sure I'd go back - unless it was to try the brunch menu. The only highlight was how nice the service was and the trendy ambiance."
,,,,,"I don't know how on earth this place had so many good reviews. If it's ambiance and you're just brunching, to be brunching, then I get it. The cocktails were okay. Burger was dry af, I almost wanted to put water on my beef patty to wetten it up. The short ribs was okay, every restaurant in the south has decided to go all in on these short rib entrees, it's getting old fast. Especially when. It isn't cooked right, low and slow please. Shirt rib shouldn't be this dry. It may have been prepared beginning of day and still served later. Anyway, the girls loved it so I'm happy, the guys however just had to drink it up and smile."

,,,,,"Awesome place for weekend boozy brunch in the city! Fun vibes, great service/staff, and & well presented food all around. We got the short rib chilaquiles (very flavorful sauce) & donut burger (very filling) which both good. The red velvet churros are a MUST HAVE (ours came out nice & warm, the dip was delicious) ! Highly recommend making reservations"
,,,,,"Excellent food. Showed up and was seated quickly for lunch. Asked server for a recommendation, whe recommended the 12 hour spare ribs, outstanding. Service was great, glass was always full. Will surely be back."
,,,,,It was a pleasure to visit Bosscat because good food without reservations became hard to find while in Houston. My friends and myself decided to visit and Bosscat did not disappoint. 
,,,,,"The drinks were pretty good, we all ordered ""The Good Life""  which was very good, sweet but not too sweet. I first ordered the ""so fresh and so clean"" and it was very strong and bitter so if you like that then you'll enjoy this drink. "
,,,,,"We started with the Spicy Chicken & Cheese dip, Pulled pork hush puppies, and fried oysters. Unfortunately we could not find any chicken in our Spicy Chicken dip which I would skip if I came here again. The Pulled pork hush puppies were kind of dry but that's about normal for a hush puppy. Now these magical fried oysters.... OMG it was amazing. Very good we wanted to order more they were delicious. "
,,,,,"For Entrees we ordered the Crispy Fried Chicken sandwich, 12 hour beef short rib, and the Cornmeal Crusted Catfish. We also ordered a side of the Mac & Cheese and the Bosscat fries. Let me say this food was amazing.... Literally everything! The Chicken sandwich was fresh, crispy, the coleslaw was pretty good. The Mac & Cheese was very gooey... a very gooey stringy cheese was used. It complemented the Short rib very well. And the Catfish was crispy, well flavored, and real fish... not that frozen stuff. You can tell this is fresh Catfish because it is not slimy! "
,,,,,The food here is extremely good and flavorful and fresh. When I'm Houston be sure to give this place a try!
,,,,,Wow! New to Houston but I'll be back.
,,,,,"The service was great, so friendly and helpful."
,,,,,"The drinks are top notch...had the Spicy Trader, nice balance."
,,,,,The short ribs...OMG! I can't even tell you how amazing these are.
,,,,,"My wife wasn't supper hungry but the ""french fries"" were NEXT LEVEL! Again I can't explain."
,,,,,Her beef stew was like eating moms food!
,,,,,Get here!
,,,,,We came for lunch on a weekday with a large group.
,,,,,Parking is spotty in the plaza. We had to resort to streetside parking because the lots were all full. Location is near River Oaks so it figures that going out is all the rage
,,,,,The ambiance was like a bar-ish setting. Music was VERY loud and we had multiple people mention it. Hard to carry a conversation when music is blasting in the background.
,,,,,"Service was not great. The server wasn't very attentive and it took forever to order, get refills, and get our check. Not great"
,,,,,"The food was average. We ordered a bunch of appetizers, some hit and miss. Poutine was good, bacon candy was much overcooked, hush puppies were good, and the spicy dip was not great. Entrees were not great. I got the brick chicken and it was not tasty; I left half the plate. Similarly, I noticed pretty much no one finished their food and didn't get Togo boxes..  yikes."
,,,,,"Overall, it's a decent place as a bar setting, would not recommend if you're coming for food only."
,,,,,"We had great service, great food, and great atmosphere! I definitely recommend coming here if you have a large party and want to rent out the whiskey room. It's pretty cool!"
,,,,,"So we think there must be a wizard or magician working in the back making the food- it can't be normal humans. My pork chop was so tender and mind-blowing that we are convinced its sorcery. It melted in my mouth. When I first saw that it was $26 on the menu, I was like ""eeek that's a little pricey for pork"" and I was hesitant but then I ate a bite and I immediately said ""ok, I get it"". Worth every penny. "
,,,,,My partner had a pulled pork sandwich and fries that were also delicious but he concedes that mine was superior. Our whiskey cocktails were also divine. And what a lovely atmosphere it is too! We definitely recommend. I hope you get to meet the wizard when you go check it out!
,,,,,This place was cool. Nice drinks. Decent service. It's been about 2 months since I was there so I can't really remember many specifics. Nothing overly positive or negative sticks out. It was a nice flow of business throughout the entire time there. I remember my burrito tasting good as well as the French toast.
,,,,,"Good food, bar atmosphere, rules on amount of time to be seated even if open tables, valet makes sense, primary space only has tall tables. Overall enjoyed the place!"

,,,,,"It looks like I'm in the minority here, but frankly I was not particularly impressed."
,,,,,"We visited Bosscat for brunch, and please understand that reservations are strongly recommended for brunch. Don't say I didn't warn you if you show up without a reservation and they're unable to seat you.  That's on you, not them."
,,,,,"The music is so overpowering that you will not be able to carry on a conversation with your tablemates. I just don't understand why management would want to create such an unpleasant dining experience. Sure, I love Jimi Hendrix, but when I go out for brunch, I want to hear my friends and not Jimi's astounding cover of ""All Along the Watchtower"" (for the millionth time). Keep the music low and ambient.  "
,,,,,"I ordered the roasted mushroom chilaquiles, which if I had to do it again, I'd spring for including the sunny egg. The presentation was excellent. I quite liked the first few bites, but it was one of those dishes where with each successive bite I grew more disinterested. By the time I reached the two-thirds mark, I wasn't full... I just couldn't face finishing it. I ordered a side of bacon that needed to be patted down - just too greasy. My partner ordered the vegetable omelette, but thought something was a bit off about the taste, and similarly did not finish it. In fairness, one of my friends had the apple cheesecake waffle and plowed right through it with a look of enjoyment."
,,,,,"The service was friendly, and water glasses were regularly topped off, which I appreciate."
,,,,,"I might return for a dinner service. Vegetarians, heads-up! Your options on the dinner menu are very limited. In fact, between the mains and sandwiches, you'll only have one choice (which in 2021 is kind of surprising, isn't it?!)."
,,,,,"I had read great reviews for this place so I was excited to try it. I arrived and they told me I could sit and eat at the bar or wait 45min for a table. I decided to go to the bar but there was no space available, so I went and added my name to the wait list. 45 minutes go by and I am still waiting for a table, I went in to ask for an update and they told me they had said 45min to 1 hour. They said I needed to wait from 15-30 minutes and my table would be ready. 30 more minutes went by, I go in again, and they say I'm up next. Finally after 1 hour and 15 min. of waiting, it's my turn!!"
,,,,,"Now onto the food: I ordered the breakfast burrito, which was very bland and dry, it did not taste like a lot even with the chipotle sauce on the side. Not very big either."
,,,,,"My friend ordered the pulled pork benedicts and she was happy with them. The pork was very tasty and juicy, and it was a good portion."
,,,,,"Lastly, we ordered the red velvet churros, and like the burrito, they were not very flavorful. Overall, I would say it is not worth it."
,,,,,"This bar is a must visit if you're in the Houston Galleria area. Don't let the dimly lit interior fool you, the atmosphere is lively, and the staff and service is top notch. And you definitely won't want to miss out on the world class cocktails."
,,,,,"First off, shout out to my man Gavin. When we sat at the bar, Gavin immediately greeted our party helped us decide on what drinks to order. Let me tell you, this man knows his drinks. We ordered the nighthawk, the old fashion, and the bosscat. Probably the best three drinks on their menu. If you're a fan of espresso coffee, you have to, HAVE TO order the nighthawk. "
,,,,,"After our drinks, Gavin made us what I can best describe as a fruity shot. You could barely taste the alcohol, but it did the job. "
,,,,,"I won't lie, as much as we enjoyed the environment and scene, Gavin made our experience memorable. If the owner of Bosscat is reading this, please tell Gavin that he's a world class bartender. Hopefully when we visit again, he'll be there!"
,,,,,"Not only do I love the food, but the establishment as a whole. The people from the bartender to the manager on staff (dark hair 5'5"" maybe Hispanic) we came in to try something new. It was a great choice! The Okra which I would never normally order was spectacular to my tastebuds. It was sweet from the sauce and savory with bits of sausage. It was everything I wanted for my palate. I could have went home satisfied at that point. I continued on with the Brocollini and crispy onions and a fried egg on top. It was great but a little under cooked. (That didn't stop my from demolishing it) now for the show stopping spicy chicken sandwich. It was prob one of those dishes you save half for later. Great sized portions all around! Yet again it was just so good I couldn't stop feeding my soul... Thank you Bosscat! I can't wait to come back!"
,,,,,Absolutely delicious. Definitely go during their happy hour to try some appetizers. We had the pulled pork tacos and then the steak entree.
,,,,,"Mmmm comfort food at its best. The food here is so good and the service was awesome as well. Came here for lunch with a friend. We were planning on coming in on a Sunday around 2:30PM but were alerted they close from 2:30-3:00 to clean the kitchen and change the menus from brunch to lunch/dinner. This was fine but random haha. Show up at 3 and are seated immediately. This was awesome because the place was packed- but they have an ample amount of indoor or outdoor seating. We started off with the spicy chicken and cheese dip which was amazing. So freaking good. The chicken in the dip had Nashville hot chicken spices, and was served warm with homemade potato chips. YUUUUMYY! For my entree I ordered the chicken sausage pasta. This was so good but so very heavy. I would recommend sharing! It was a tomato pesto sauce  with chicken sausage, veggies and pappardelle pasta. Soooo good but could not finish my plate. Made for awesome take out though! "
,,,,,I definitely want to come back and check out how their brunch is!!
,,,,,"This place is amazing! Indoor and outdoor seating options, we opted to sit outside. Our waiter Jerry was extremely knowledgeable, personable and attentive. We didn't wait long on anything the throes time. The bed and breakfast shot comes with bacon and is absolutely smooth and delicious. The chicken fried steak was perfectly made and extremely filling (can definitely be for 2 people). The shrimp and grits was yummy with just enough kick and fill of flavor. When I'm Houston, this will forever be a go-to place from"
,,,,,Now on.
,,,,,"I've come here twice now and I have never been disappointed! The menu is very interesting and quite unique. However, they have a great, knowledgeable staff who are super helpful when it comes to this. My friends and I usually struggle to pick something, but the food tastes MUCH better than it sounds. My entire table has left satisfied every time. Both times, I came during Houston Restaurant Week where they have limited edition menu offerings. One time I went and was able to get the Crawfish Empanadas. If you see this on your menu, get it!!! You will not regret it. I definitely want to return for brunch to try that side of the menu!"
,,,,,I visited Bosscat Kitchen & Libations along with my husband for an afternoon date night. It's located in RiverOaks. We visited on a weekend so we didn't have a issue with parking. 
,,,,,We were greeted upon us entering the restaurant by the hostess who was very pleasant and friendly. The restaurant has a modern field and nicely decorated with a pink roses wall outside the entrance. 
,,,,,"We were seated immediately. Our waiter came to our table in a adequate time and informed us of their happy hour specials, which includes appetizers and cocktails. "
,,,,,"We started drinks and a appetizer!  We ordered the  Boss lady and Boss cat  cocktails and Bosscat fries, neither was not included on the happy hour menu. The fries were thick, fresh and came with a spicy ketchup on the side. We both were pleased with our drinks and appetizer."
,,,,, 
,,,,,"For our entree, I ordered the cornmeal crusted fried fish which came with a mushroom sauce rice and drizzle with a tobacco red sauce. Surprisingly, my dish was very good. My husband ordered his usually, pasta. The pasta wasn't to my liking due to it being tomato base however, hubby was satisfied with his meal."
,,,,,Overall this restaurant establishment was very nice. It's a great place to converse and catch up. The food and cocktails were good.
,,,,,They also have a patio area and serve brunch on weekends.
,,,,,I definitely would return and recommend this establishment to others.
,,,,,"Yea this place is one of my new favorite brunch spots in Houston now. A little crowded on this inside, but that is to be expected with the number of people who wish to dine here. Everything on the menu is good and worth giving a try. We got the tater tot with egg appetizer (not sure the name), and personally, I got the fruity pebble french toast which I don't think could have been executed better. Alongside that, I got the protein pancakes and they were actually really good, don't let the description deceive you. Would 100% recommend if you need a brunch spot."

,,,,,Wasn't bad I give it a 7/10. Food came out super fast. The customer service was pretty good. Nice ambience. Very good music. Good date night spot. Good vibes overall.
,,,,,"I was really excited about this place because I've been try to visit for some time. However, the service was very disappointing. The waitress came to the table after getting our drinks, asked if we were ready, and then walked off. "
,,,,,We ordered drinks and then waited a total of 20 minutes before I went and asked the hostess by the door if she could take our order or find our waitress. 
,,,,,Our waitress returned shortly after and took our order. The food was absolutely amazing! Everything was really good. Don't recommend the cornbread madeleines. (Underwhelming; very cold and grainy texture) 
,,,,,If the service was better this place would be a gem!
,,,,,"Tried this restaurant during my birthday trip. Disappointed!! The drinks were not good. The menu does not have a lot of options. Ordered a chicken flatbread, it came with cold tomatoes on top. The bread was more doughy than crispy.  I ordered fried fish for my entree and it left a lot to be desired. The waitress saw that we barely touched or food but didn't even ask if everything was okay."
,,,,,Overall we were drawn here as a good lunch stop in walking distance to our hotel (and the liquor store). 
,,,,,Service is on 10000% here. I do wish I remember our servers name but literally everyone there was checking in on us and just super helpful and hospitable
,,,,,The ambiance was dope. Drinks were weak but my friend thoroughly enjoyed his old fashioned it was one of the best he had. 
,,,,,The sauce for the portobello mushroom fries was similar to a blooming onion which is one of my favorites. The mushrooms had a big too much batter for me where the flour started to infringe on the flavor / texture of the mushroom. I'd prefer more light tempura style for these. 
,,,,,We both felt our pork sandwich and fried chicken was superb thus you can't go wrong with either.
,,,,,"Tried to come here for brunch on one of the weekdays we were here but due to the storm, they were closed so we got lucky and tried again before our flight on Wednesday. Was hoping they had their brunch menu but they only serve brunch on the weekends (Saturday and Sunday). Cute upscale decor. Theres cute elegant decor with florals, wooden barrels and a large glass room with all of their whiskey."
,,,,,I ordered their catfish with risotto and my significant other ordered their BC press which is a pulled pork sandwhich and we both shared a side of mac & cheese. I also ordered their good life cocktail which I really enjoyed. It was refreshing with a vodka base. My sister got their BC sweet tea which had a bourbon base and it was strong. Their catfish was good. Fried perfectly that the crust had a good crunch. The sweet and spicy sauce complemented every bite with the mushroom risotto which was thick and creamy. Every bite was curated so perfectly. Their mac & cheese was okay. I thought it was going to be amazing due to the cheese pull but it was kind of bland. The crusted bread crumbs that was sprinkled on top was not good. It caused the mac and cheese to have a stale taste rather than a good crunch on top.
,,,,,"Overall, it was a good experience. I believe our server was Dominic but he was nice and attentive. We were the only table seated when we arrived at 11:30am but it slowly filled up. Dominic was friendly and got all of our orders correctly."
,,,,,"Visited the Houston area during the holidays and decided to check this spot out. If you're looking for a moderately quiet dinner with family, this is not your spot! The music can come across as too loud for some. However, it's perfect for date night, getting drinks, and catching up with friends. The steak was AMAZING and I regret not ordering it for myself. The salmon barbecue was good. Needed a little rice/mashed potato on the side, but it was flavorful. For dessert, save your money and don't buy the churros. The apple pie was the saving grace for the night ! Shoutout to Henry for holding down our table with his wonderful customer service !!"
,,,,,"Delicious brunch, and great cocktails! The hot Cheetos Bloody Mary is a winner for anyone with a spicy craving!"
,,,,,"It was a very trendy place (Pinterest worthy wall of flowers, outside seating, etc). The food was on par with other trendier places ( you're paying for the experience also) in terms of aesthetics. It was very flavorful ."
,,,,,The staff was very nice. We did come during brunch time on Sunday so they were very busy.
,,,,,"Great place for a casual lunch! I ordered the 12 hour Beef Short Rib, and it was mouthwateringly good. The short rib was so tender and melted in my mouth, and I especially loved how they cut the scalloped potatoes into thin rectangles. The barbecue sauce they used for the beef was sweet and delicious, and I liked how the sauce seeped through to the potatoes underneath the short ribs as well Service was just average; the waitress just came by to take our order and give us the bill. If you are willing to go spend the money, I would recommend giving the short ribs a try!"
,,,,,"Wanted to get a quick brunch with my mom before getting on my flight. Nice atmosphere, very open and airy on a Sunday, and all the games are playing on the TVs. The Bathrooms were cute and most importantly, clean! "
,,,,,"The food was very tasty, nothing was too salty. My mom loved her Doughnut burger, and she doesn't like a runny egg at all.  I really liked the hollandaise sauce on my Benedict, eggs poached perfectly and the biscuit kind tasted like a ""fry"" bread in texture. Great Portions for the price and good service. Definitely a good idea."

,,,,,I came here for the first time the other day and it was really nice. This place has a nice ambiance and the service was top notch. 
,,,,,"I had the pineapple elixir cocktail and the salmon plate and I substituted the succotash for green beans. I enjoyed everything I tried, but I wouldn't say it was really anything out of the ordinary. "
,,,,,I would recommend a reservation as they can get pretty packed.
,,,,,So I messed up big time. I did not look at the reviews before coming here! This place was on my list of places to go to. 
,,,,,I got the shrimp and grits. To my surprise it was made with a red sauce.  Yuck! I hated it. Shrimp and grits should be creamy. I'm not sure but the shrimp did not seem fresh rather it seemed frozen. 
,,,,,"The fries, with their signature recipe, was super ""crunchy"" with the ends being close to burnt. Also nothing to wow about with the chow chow ketchup."
,,,,,There was no dairy free milk available for coffee. 
,,,,,Be sure to request high vs low tables. 
,,,,,"Now the look of the place, Beautiful! I definitely  wouldn't mind sitting at the bar and having a few drinks. But I'm good on the eats."
,,,,,"I've been to this restaurant twice for business meetings, every time that I've gone, the staff is professional, knowledgeable, and friendly. The food is delicious! My favorite appetizer is the pork belly bites. I've tried several dishes even though I've only been there twice as my friends and I try each other's plates. The saints have been tasty as well. I really enjoyed their Old Fashioned. The ambiance is laid back and mellow, the noise level isn't too loud, we have been able to speak comfortably without having to whisper or yell. I highly recommend this place for any occasion from reseving a business meetings to date night."
,,,,,Brunch was absolutely amazing! The fruity pebbles French toast is so unique and the eggs benedict was one of the best I've ever had! The red velvet churros were everyone's favorite!
,,,,,"My whiskey-loving buddy invited us for dinner and drinks at this urban restaurant slash whiskey room. It was virtually empty on a Tuesday night, but the décor was nice: lots of leather and wood."
,,,,,"First off, let's talk ""libations."" I've been on an aperol kick lately, so I sampled the 38 Special 14, a blend of bourbon, amero, aperol, and citrus. I got plenty of the sweet woody bourbon and nutty amaro, but the characteristic bitterness of the aperol was missing and the orange was a bit overpowering. The Old Fashioned was great, no complains whatsoever. We also shared a whiskey flight after our meal which was decent, but we were a little disappointed in the overly judicious half-shot pours (3 varieties for $24)."
,,,,,"The menu covers mainly American territory, with perhaps a Southern bent. The Portabello Mushroom 'Fries' were decent. The light crispy batter was solid and the smoked jalapeno sauce was excellent, but the inside was chewy and could've been cooked longer, plus it was under-salted. The Pork Belly Poutine showcased some fantastic soft, sticky meat, but there wasn't enough cheese curds and fries were yet again lacking in salt (though they were wonderfully crunchy). The Mushroom Quinoa burger was actually delicious, and I enjoyed it. The bun was perfectly soft, the juicy patty held its form, and the favors worked well. Finally, the Red Velvet Churros boasted ideal texture with a crackly outside and gooey interior, but I honestly didn't get too much red velvet flavor."
,,,,,"It's a cool place, the service was passable, and the drinks and food were fairly good. I'm sure things liven up over the weekend as well."
,,,,,Hi Guys!! I hope all is well with you today. 
,,,,,"So this restaurant/ bar is an awesome place to meet with your friends. Their isn't a lot of parking so be prepared to pay for valet or drive around a bit to find parking. But once you get in there the inside is very spacious. They also have two small patio areas that you can enjoy right outside the front of the building. They bar area is large and probably sits around 25 people. They offer tall tables, booths, private rooms, and single small tables. The brunch is something to look forward to because its so yummy. I like to come here with the girls because its such a beautiful place, the food is yummy, and the liberations are set at a great price."
,,,,,This place is awesome. My boyfriend and I came here for happy hour and to watch the Texas Tech game. We order food and drinks and it was amazing. Bryce and Benji were THEE BEST bartenders I've met. They made sure our drinks were to perfection!! I had the Rośe Bellini pitcher drink and my bf had a beer and magical orange tequila drink that Benji made for him! I would totally recommend this place for Sunday fun day!!! 
,,,,,Bryce and Benji made our experience exceptional!! I'm
,,,,,Came here for brunch around 10:20 without a reservation. There were very few tables taken and we were asked about a reservation which we did not have. They said they could still seat us as long as we knew we had to leave in an hour and a half (not sure why it would take that long to eat brunch but we agreed). 
,,,,,"The short rib chilaquiles was mediocre, the smokehouse Benedict was actually tasty, and the fruity people French toast will give anyone a sugar rush). If you are looking for a ""wow"" meal and great service, you may want to continue your search. We did not order anything from the bar although most tables did have multiple drinks on them. So, that might be the secret to why it has so many stars from other yelpers."
,,,,,"Really enjoyed the food, drinks and the atmosphere! The Bartender was extremely helpful, answered all questions and I never felt rushed because the restaurant was completely packed. I think the Bartender's name was Dar and I'll be visiting again... I forgot that I had the shrimp and grits mmmm!"

,,,,,"When in Texas, gotta eat their BBQ. And this made it to my top list of places to try. There was no line but they were packed, luckily I did find seating to sit on the inside and not outside because it was cold. I ordered the 2 meat plate which came with 2 sides and texas toast."
,,,,,"I got the brisket, jalapeno sausage, baked beans, and mac & cheese. There's a condiment station with free unlimited pickled veggies and sauces. So had my helping of that (really liked the pickled onions). The brisket was to be honest a little on the dry side. My cut of brisket was tender but it wasn't really moist. I should've asked for a more fattier cut of meat. However, I still liked the meat because that smokiness is so unique to Houston. It's very different from any of the bbq places I've tried outside of Texas so I gotta give them credit for that. That's the real smoky flavor that you want when you're eating bbq. You can also see a nice smoke ring on the outside of the brisket. The sausage were very juicy and spicy. The sides can speak for themselves, it's baked beans and mac & cheese you cant mess that up. So they would've gotten a 5 star if my brisket was more moist."
,,,,,"Thank you for the great review, Cindy. We fill up quick and the line can be long but, our staff does a great job at moving the line along quickly. Also, don't forget that we have extended seating next door at the Patio at the Pit Room. Plenty of both outdoor and indoor seating for cooler months."
,,,,,Brisket - Fairly tender and decently seasoned. Some slices were great. Some were on the dry side (end pieces).
,,,,,Pork Ribs - These were pretty tender/fatty with some chew! The rub had a nice pepperyness but otherwise quite average. Would definitely recommend these.
,,,,,Pork Sausage (Jalapeno Cheddar) - Good flavor but a tad bit overcooked and dry. 
,,,,,Coleslaw - Quite average. Not creamy. The vinergaryness was nice though.
,,,,,Potato Salad - Nice soft texture but quite underwhelming.
,,,,,Ran out of brisket at the beginning of lunch; pulled pork reminds me of the stuff in a can you get at elementary school lunch; coleslaw was underseasoned; saving grace was the beans and free water
,,,,,"Decided to try this place out since it was close to my hotel and also because of the large number of reviews. My expectation was a bit too high, which might be the reason why I didn't think it was amazing. It was ok nothing memorable. "
,,,,,"When I arrived the place was somewhat empty, so I was able to order pretty quick. The food is pretty much all ready to just be served, so I was able to eat right away. "
,,,,,I ordered the brisket with two sides. The mustard potato salad and the mac n cheese. It also came with a slice of bread and bbq sauce. 
,,,,,"The brisket was pretty good. The mac n cheese was ok and the potato salad taste was pure mustard pretty much, so I didn't like much. The bread was soft and good and the bbq sauce which is served warm tasted very different than what I am used to, so I ended up not eating it."
,,,,,This place has some really good barbecue. I don't really get to each much beef barbecue so I was looking forward to my visit to the Pit Room. 
,,,,,"I got a whole smorgasbord worth of meet. I had a beef rib, a few slices of brisket, beef sausage, street corn, and Mac & cheese. The sausage has a nice little kick to it. It wasn't spicy but it did have some heat."
,,,,,The brisket was very juicy. It also has a smoky flavor too it. I also like the beef rib. It was a little fatty but still very good. This was one of the best meals I had while in Texas. You know the BBQ is good when you don't have to put sauce on it!
,,,,,Wow. The beef ribs and beef brisket were amazing. Both had a nice pepper bark. Meat was tender so really no need to use sauce. Love the bread a cross between a slice of Texas toast and sourdough. The charred green bean side was out of this world. Indoor seating was tight (chose to sit inside over very accommodating outdoor patio). I will be  eating there before I leave town.
,,,,,"Continuing my mission for sampling BBQ in Texas, there were 2 places in Houston that I had to try. One was The Pit Room. This place did not disappoint. There was the expected line outside the door and surprisingly everyone had face masks and was social distancing. It was very orderly and limited entry in the establishment. The ordering process is cafeteria style, the first station is the meat guy who cuts to order your selection, the next is the sides guy who dished up your side dishes, then the drinks person and the condiments, plasticware, napkin station, then you pay. Very efficient. These guys do a good job with the process. "
,,,,,"I had the 3 meat dinner which came with 2 sides. I had the Pork Ribs, Brisket and the Beef Sausage (Czech style and homemade). For sides I had the mac n cheese and the mustard potato salad).  My wife had the brisket and the Elote (roasted corn, covered with a creamy topping, spices, fresh lime, and plenty of cheese ) as a side dish. Each dish was served with the obligatory white bread slice, white onions and dill pickle chips."
,,,,,The food was awesome and plentiful. I loved all of it and highly recommend this place whenever you're in Houston.

I joke you not... we were bidding on buying a 6 plex multi fam property... and decided to make our counter bid based on the fact it was near this restaurant and we would have a reason to come out this way and eat here hahhaa.

,,,,,"Very good barbecue! We had the pork ribs, brisket and the brisket tacos. Chips and queso were delicious. The line was a bit long but did move pretty quickly. It was worth the wait!"
,,,,,"Honestly I was unimpressed with this place. I got the 2 meat plate and added a 1/4 pound of pulled pork in the side. My 2 meats for the entree were ribs and sliced brisket. They even put a feed burnt ends on the plate and those even lacked flavor. The pulled pork was moist and somewhat good. What was good though was the okra, I'm NOT and okra fan at all but I enjoyed it the most. What was good though was the okra, I'm NOT and okra fan at all but I enjoyed it the most."
,,,,,The expectation for a place with this many stars should be a little higher than what you would have for a normal BBQ joint. The food looked the part but lacked in flavor.
,,,,,(Review based on 3.5 stars)
,,,,,The Pit Room is located in Montrose with parking available and also outdoor seating that is dog friendly. But there is more outdoor seating available at the bar next door in which you are allowed to sit and eat your food there (there is a sign that directs patrons if they desire to eat next door in or outside). 
,,,,,"We decided to try this barbecue because I was highly recommended by a local that I must try pit barbecue because there is a difference from other types of barbecue, like Rudy's that my husband and I had a few days before. "
,,,,,"Pit barbecue refers to a method in which the meat is cooked underground. So a hole is dug in the ground and lined with stones (could also be brick, sand and could also be leaves or a combination), which is the same style used in Hawaii when you see a pig being dug out at a luau. This barbecue method allows the heat to be retained, which results in a very tender and fall off the bone meat (the method is similar to use of a smoker). "
,,,,,"My husband, our little girl and I decided to order the following, after looking over the menu (we came in after 3:30 pm and there was only 2 people ahead of us): "
,,,,,"Brisket, 1/2 lb, $9.95 prior to tax- This brisket was moist but I didn't like the heavy smoke taste. So this ended up being my least favorite barbecue place for brisket (we ended up having barbecue at 3 different places during our visit). My husband liked the brisket. "
,,,,,"Pork Ribs 1/4 lb, $4.75 prior to tax- The ribs were definitely fall of the bone tender, just as the one local had said to me and insisting that I try pit barbecue. But again, felt that the smoke taste was too much for me so I didn't enjoy the ribs as much as my husband did. "
,,,,,"Venison Sausage, $4.50 prior to tax- This was disappointing, as it was dry and would not recommend ordering this. "
,,,,,Complementary White Bread- We were only given 2 pieces with our tray but was able to ask for 2 more slices (figured it would be nice to have a little extra for the 3 of us).
,,,,,-----------------------
,,,,,(Total= $20.78 after tax)
,,,,,"Overall, I thought this place was just okay and wouldn't come back. But who knows, maybe this place would be best suited for your palette. "
,,,,,"Please note that if you do sit outside, you may have some smokers that may ruin your meal, like the group of smokers that did for our meal (please also note that there are heat lamps outside by the bar side if you dine here during the colder months)."
,,,,,"Food was great. Plenty of outdoor seating. The line moved pretty quickly. It can be easy, so be prepared to wait, or wait and go during the non-rush hours."
,,,,,I dont really get the long lines outside this place. The meat was overly peppered when i ate here i did not enjoy it at all. Expensive price point for the quality of the food.
,,,,,Brisket was great. Got a slice off the point and a slice off the flat with my two meat dinner. Point was candy so tender and juicy. Honestly the fat was great as well. Good bark too!  Jalapeño cheddar sausage was great. Sauce is very good too but I used it more for my bread and Mac an cheese which was very creamy and moist. Saw a beef rib on table next to use that looked great as well!  Definitely will be back.
,,,,,"The best BBQ spot I've found in this part of Houston! I've got to say, brisket is difficult to perfect and they set the bar high; however, the venison sausage is absolutely AMAZING! "
,,,,,I highly recommend it. I literally had a flashback to a time as a kid after having a bite. 
,,,,,A modern Houston staple. 
,,,,,"Controversially, even better than rodeo BBQ."
,,,,,"Excellent BBQ. Wish there was more seating space, but the vibe feels very homestyle mom & pop, which I like. The sauce is amazing and I'm a strong critique about sauces."
,,,,,"This place was delicious!! We thought it was going to be so so crowded but they have another room on the back with a full bar, good music, and excellent company! A must go in the Houston area"

,,,,,"Texas BBQ!  For those that don't truly BBQ or smoke meats perhaps you don't realize how difficult or how much effort is needed to perfect good BBQ.  As for The Pit Room, it is Central Texas style BBQ (for those like me that are not from Texas, there are East, West, South and Central styles).  "
,,,,,"Top notch quality and for me, the value in what you are getting and paying for is easily 5 stars.  Based on the founders, the heart and soul of the pit room are two, custom-made, barrel-style offset smokers with a vertical sausage cooker sitting adjacent to one of the pits. As for the meats going into the pit, they'll be of high quality. All beef will be U.S.D.A. Prime and all pork will be a heritage, Berkshire-Duroc breed from California."
,,,,,"The sausages are amazing, the brisket and ribs amazing.  Dinners are served with your choice of two sides and one slice of white bread.  I have always gotten the two meat variety for $15.95 and can barely finish that.  And for the sides, I've had the Charro beans, Cole slaw and mustard potato salad. I can't complain about any of those sides.  Sauces?  Try them all as there is a dispenser to get your sauce on."
,,,,,"This last visit, we sat in the outdoor/open bar, enjoyed beers from around Texas and then ordered our food and sat outside. "
,,,,,"If you don't believe what I am writing, well, The Pit Room made the Texas Monthly Top 50 BBQ Joints in Texas.  Again, me not from the great state of TX, that's got to be a tough list to make.  Thanks Michael Sambrooks and Pit Master, Bramwell Tripp for this culinary experience when I visit Houston."
,,,,,Thanks you for the amazingly detailed review and photos! Come back to see us soon!!!

,,,,,"Honestly, the Pit Room is the reason I live in Texas. It was first introduced to me over a meal as I debated the move and then I tasted their brisket and it sealed my deal. Absolutely the best."
,,,,,"Everything was delicious, even the vinegar cucumber. You can see that they are not afraid to season their food. I love the black peppers. This order is a 1meat dinner plate, and it came with two sides; I got orka and green bean."
,,,,,My brother and I had some friends in from out of town and they wanted to get some good ole Texas BBQ. This was our first time here. 
,,,,,"Line was just about at the entrance when we arrived but eventually died down. In line we asked one of the workers if we can sub out pork times from one of the family platters and they said yes. When we got to the front of the line it was another story. Nonetheless, no worries we had back up options. "
,,,,,"Simply ordered beef ribs and the 3 brisket tacos and 2 sides...expected a bill of 42-45 bucks or so. Instead got slammed with a 63 dollar bill. With the massive line behind us, we definitely felt rushed and pressured into paying quickly. Surely my fault for not sorting it out then. "
,,,,,"After a few minutes I was so confused and went back to the register, they said we got the premium beef ribs instead of the regulars. And I told them that's not what I ordered and I'm not a regular to know the difference. They was 0 attempt to fix the situation or anything. They just stared at me like I was an alien lol. "
,,,,,"Anyways...food was good, not going to lie. Haven't had too much authentic texas BBQ, but generally speaking food was good, not great. Was the ""premium"" beef rib worth it? Absolutely not. Mac n cheese was watery. Tacos were probably the best part. "
,,,,,Parking around the back but somewhat limited. Street parking around the area.
,,,,,"VERY YUMMY and fun southern comfort food joint in Houston. The pulled pork and brisket tacos were amazing, and the meat was so juicy and flavorful. One of my favorite parts of the restaurant was the help yourself pickled bar station, which was full of pickles, pickled onions, pickled carrots and much more! This is an amazing place to come with family and friends, as there is lots of outdoor seating with lights and a lovely patio."
,,,,,"The best BBQ I've had in my lifeeeeee. The brisket is amazing. It's so flavorful, moist and tender. I usually get their breakfast tacos and they're really good. Seems like their tortillas are homemade but I'm not entirely sure. They're thin and good as well! Also had their pulled pork and sausages which were ok but the star was the brisket"
,,,,,"Best bbq in town. Fatty brisket is my go to with a side of Mac n cheese, beans and the jalapeño chorizo WOW WOW WOW."
,,,,,Why 5 stars? Because this is BBQ heaven.
,,,,,   ---   ---   ---
,,,,,"I really appreciate that The Pit Room offers a couple of different ""Feast"" options on the menu, which basically just consist of all the meat options. We went with Feast #1, the smallest of the two feasts. Feast #2 has the same items, but more of them."
,,,,,"The brisket was definitely the standout for me, followed by both kinds of ribs as kind of a close second. But really, I enjoyed everything, though I'm not really a fan of turkey in general. "
,,,,,"The elote was my favorite side, but the others didn't really stand out much. "
,,,,,"I appreciated the self-serve bar with some various goodies, highlighted by the delicious pickles, which we took many of. "
,,,,,"And lastly, we really enjoyed sitting outside on the patio which seemed to belong more to the sister restaurant, but is a shared space. It gave us a bit more room to stretch out - something we desperately needed after eating all of this food!"
,,,,,Thank you for your awesome review and photos!
,,,,,We do also own the Patio (at the Pit Room). You are always welcome to bring your food over to the Patio and enjoy a beverage from the full bar. 
,,,,,Thanks again! Have a great week.
,,,,,"Room temperature Tasteless and very greasy charred green beans, dehydrated greasy (not butter) corn, and the worst pc of fatty meat. It was smoked well I will give them that. But My money and my appetite could have been better tended to in a McDonalds drive-thru with a 42$ donation to Charity to boot. And I don't even like McD. I am still upset at almost midnight now and hungry too. "
,,,,,Just sickening to feel so ripped off in broad daylight. 
,,,,," ... after telling the man behind the counter I could not eat such fatty meat, they still handed me a gross pc of meat that I had to leave behind unfit for normal consumption. Maybe someone who was severely malnourished could benefit from forks full of fat. "
,,,,,As bad as Killens. I feel ripped off totally.
,,,,,"Arrived at 1 on a weekday and while the place was certainly busy, it was not packed. The line was just a few people deep, and there was plenty of seating. I was solo so unfortunately didn't get to order the beef rib. Tried the brisket and venison sausage. "
,,,,,"Venison sausage was ok, but I don't recommend ordering it. The spicy taste was kind of strong, so I could barely taste the meat. "
,,,,,"Brisket was good, although not one of the best places that I've been to in Texas. There was too much pepper seasoning on the bark. But the meat quality itself was fine, and I liked the degree of smoky flavor. I felt that the price was quite reasonable too at $20 a lb."
,,,,,Thank you the great review Angelo! The Beef Rib does move quickly and we are so sorry to hear you didn't get to experience it. 
,,,,,"Just a tip; anytime you come see us at the Pit Room, feel free to call ahead to check on any of our limited or specialty items. We also take call ahead orders!"
,,,,,Thanks again for sharing the love. We hope to see you again soon.
,,,,,"This place is by far the best bbq that I've eaten in a restaurant.  The beef brisket was crusted and seasoned to perfection. Beef sausage and pork ribs were equally tasty.  They have a coffee based sauce that is different and super tasty! I decided to try the charred okra and I'm glad I did, it was soooo delish!  I can't wait to go back!"
,,,,,"Parking is kind of a small, which could make parking a challenge, if you go on a busy day."
,,,,,"Thank you for sharing the love! Don't forget that our parking extends into the lot next door, at our sister concept, The Patio at the Pit Room. "
,,,,,"Also, there is a lot across the street on Richmond where our guests are free to park every day after 5 pm!"

,,,,,We've had great experiences in the past but today everything we ordered was dry and really unsatisfying we didn't even take the time to finish the ribs we are keeping them to give to the dogs
,,,,,Pretty good bbq don't come late they tend to run out of certain meats. They get pretty busy but the line goes fast.
,,,,,I recommend brisket for meats and the Mac and cheese for sides I will definitely need to come again to try out the beef ribs and pulled pork. They have good beer and lots of drink choices. Prices are average $.
,,,,,Had high hopes but it didn't live up to it. Pricey place for small servings. Had the 3 meat and the 3 taco dinners and some more sides. All 3 meats were dry. Like no moisture .  Barely any meat for the dinner. Got a side of corn for my little boy and it was $4. Like a cup worth of plain corn. The sides servings are little small. Killens is killin them
,,,,,"Delicious!!!  We did have to wait in line for about 20 minutes, but it was a nice day out so we didn't mind.  The employees were all fantastic, the atmosphere was great and the brisket and green beans were to die for!"
,,,,,4.5 stars
,,,,,"Wow, can't believe it took me so long to come here considering how much closer this place is, and this whole time I would travel to Killens BBQ for my Texas BBQ fix. Don't get me wrong, I think Killens is still my favorite, but this place is a close second, and since the drive time is less than half, I will definitely be coming back here more."
,,,,,"I came on a Thursday mid afternoon and there was no line at all. A few patrons were dining in but plenty of seating. I got a two meat combo (pork ribs + turkey) with two sides (Mac and cheese + coleslaw). I enjoyed both my meats and turkey wasn't dry (yay!), but still think Killens turkey is even juicier. Mac and cheese was yummy and cole slaw was a surprise with the unexpected heat. Probably would try another side next time. Was a bit disappointed to find no desserts since the super heavy desserts are another thing I look forward at Killens, but no biggie. This isn't Killens and they serve what they want to serve, so I will stop trying to impose Killens on them. "
,,,,,Overall a great place with great food!
,,,,,"Spectacular restaurant. The food is to die for. Also not to mention great service - someone always picks up on the first ring when ordering for carry out, are incredibly friendly, and make sure that pickup time is quick. Can't say enough good things about it"
,,,,,We were coming back from a cruise & had to have BBQ from Houston & decided to give this place a shot after reading their amazing reviews!
,,,,,"We came on a Saturday morning right when they opened so it was not too hectic, but do beware that they do get busy, & they do not take reservations."
,,,,,Brisket:  Incredibly tender.  But very too.
,,,,,"Pork Sausage:  Flavorful, but very dry too"
,,,,,"Brisket Taco:  A must order!  Love the sauce the brisket is drenched in & omg, their flour tortilla is so yum, I went back to order just tortillas!"
,,,,,I used to drive to Austin for the best bbq in the business. Gone are those days. The Pit room is where it's at!
,,,,,"Today is my 32nd birthday, so whatever the birthday boy wants the birthday boy gets. So I decided to come here because I was craving for some ribs baddddddddd. We came here during the lunch rush but surprisingly it wasn't too busy plus it's a Tuesday so I didn't expect for it to be fully packed. I ordered the two meat combo, I got the pork ribs, brisket & my sides were Mac & cheese and pinto beans. The ribs & brisket were seasoned to perfection, as for the ribs it was a little dry & I was expecting for it to fall off the bone but it didn't, still good & big af though. Same for the brisket, it was a little dry but taste wise it was excellent, I also love the fatty part of it because it had the right amount of salt to give the meaty part some flavor. Mac and cheese were above average, I love cheese but got damn did y'all pour the entire cow in there. I am not a fan of pinto beans but these were fantastic, it had a nice kick of spice. Overall, I enjoyed my birthday lunch and I'll definitely come back next time."
,,,,,"You don't need my review to know that this place is amazing. The barbecue is simply top notch. Everything is clearly home made and done in a unique way that will have you comparing it with the best barbecue you've had around the country. I came on a day they had the wagyu beef rib special and it was a unique and delicious eating experience I will never forget (but be prepared for the HIGH cost of the ribs. I recommend sharing).  The sausage was delicious and the brisket was tender and tasty. The grilled okra special was also fantastic! A complex, tasty sauce little bit of kick to it. Don't skip the pickled veggies!! You cannot go wrong eating here."

,,,,,"This is a belated, pre-COVID review."
,,,,,"We had Feast No. 1, which includes Brisket, Pork Ribs, Beef Rib, Pulled Pork, Turkey, Beef link,  Jalapeno Cheddar link and four sides. Everything was outstanding. We had to wait in line a while, but it was well worth it."
,,,,,We've been on a cross country roadtrip and couldn't leave Texas without trying their BBQ. This place did not disappoint. Food was great and the staff was amazing. Highly recommend.
,,,,,"Such good bbq!! The turkey and brisket were our favorite, but everything is quite delicious. We got the 3 meat meal and shared between two people."
,,,,,The meat is decent. Mediocre. I'm disappointed though because there's all this hype about Texas bbq and it's not as great as I expected it to be. The meat is half dry and half fat. Please don't get the elote/esquites. It's not the normal elotes that everyone's aware of. It's so much more on the tangy/limey side. I probably wouldn't come back here.
,,,,,"I got the brisket. I thought that it tasted ok, but was a bit dry. And the sauce selection is small. The sauce they provided also had a strong tomato taste which I am not used to when eating bbq. The sides were also very basic."
,,,,,I've had plenty of bbq places. This place is mediocre for the pork ribs. Not fall off the bone type - have to really chew the meat off the bone. Brisket is alright.
,,,,,"The pork ribs are good, Brisket is ok they went heavy with the pepper, sausage was  meh, the side leave a lot to be desired and the bbq sauce is different. Not bad overall though but not the best I've had.... Get the pork ribs though"
,,,,,"Holy mother of barbecue, I'm in heaven and I never want to leave. Best bbq I've ever had. Wowzers! The Mac and cheese (best ever) is made with queso and absolutely amazing. The okra is cooked perfectly with just the right seasoning. The meats...oh the meats. My man and I shared a 3-meat platter and we're full. Ate the whole thing, and getting a platter to go. The Czech sausages were legit!"
,,,,,"OMG!!!  The BBQ at this place is on point!  Went and got the three meat platter, pulled pork, brisket, and ribs.  For sides we had mac and cheese, potato salad and elote.  The brisket was so moist and flavorful, the pulled pork was juicy and the rib was oh so tender and they all had just the right amount of smoke.  The potato salad was perfectly seasoned....and the mustard is not over powering.  It had a good balance.  The Mac and cheese had good flavor but it was very soupy and we were not a fan of the elote.  It just had way too much sauce on it and the corn itself was not tasty.  With that being said I would come here for the BBQ in a heartbeat!"
,,,,,"A couple of friends and I came here because we were craving some rodeo food. One of my friends who was with us had heard about this place, so we decided to give it a try. We each ordered the 2-meat dinner. It comes with 2 choices of meat, 2 choices of sides, and a slice of bread."
,,,,,My 2 choices of meat were: brisket and pork ribs. My 2 sides were: cole slaw and mac n cheese.
,,,,,"The brisket was really good but it wasn't as tender compared to other BBQ places that I've tried, such as Killen's (in Pearland) and Franklin's (in ATX). I wasn't a super huge fan of the pork ribs. The meat portion was a little hard to bite off of the rib itself and didn't come off as easily as I had hoped it would. It was also very chewy, which I usually prefer my BBQ meat to be more tender. The cole slaw was decent, but I felt like it needed a little more seasoning or dressing on it. The mac n cheese was excellent! "
,,,,,"The portions are great, and I felt like the service was great too! I feel like even though there were a lot of people there at the time that we went, seating wasn't a huge problem because people ate and left. By the time we finished ordering our food, someone had left and we were able to get a table. It definitely hits the spot if you're craving BBQ."
,,,,,I think I would come back and try out other meats to see how they are.

,,,,,"This might be the best spot in Houston. You can't come here and not get the brisket, it's literally the best brisket I've ever had. I flew into Houston on a business trip and this spot was recommended to me from some local co workers, wow were they spot on. Absolutely hands down 5 star food."
,,,,,You don't come here for the ambiance you come here for the food. Just excellent. Kid friendly too.
,,,,,Ya'll have to eat here. Life changing bbq. I never thought I liked bbq that much until I ate here. 
,,,,,Our order:
,,,,,1 beef rib 
,,,,,"2 meat + 2 sides plate with Brisket, Venison Sausage, elote cup with everything, charred green beans "
,,,,,1 Chili cup with everything
,,,,,"Received raw onions, pickled veggies, pickled jalapeños, and extra bbq sauce on the side"
,,,,,Total ~$50
,,,,,"Best beef rib we have ever eaten. Beef rib meat so tender, moist, not greasy, perfectly seasoned - eaten alone or with the homemade bbq sauce is just heaven in your mouth. My partner ate it so fast while I was taking pictures, I didn't even get to eat half of it cuz he ate it so quickly."
,,,,,"Brisket was tender and moist as well, burnt end bark was amazing and perfectly seasoned. There was no bitter burned taste at all on any of the brisket. "
,,,,,Venison sausage was delicious and seasoned well.
,,,,,Charred green beans were the best Texan green beans I ever ate.
,,,,,Elote cup with all the toppings was fabulous. Well balanced flavors.
,,,,,"Chili with all the toppings, delicious and lots of beef inside. Best chili I've eaten in a while. "
,,,,,"Homemade bbq sauce was amazing - not too sweet or vinegary, well balanced on any of the meats. "
,,,,,Homemade pickled veggies and pickled jalapeños were excellent and a healthy touch. Much better than the canned variety. I like that they didn't add much if any sugar to the pickled condiments. Pickled condiments taste better when they are NOT sweet!
,,,,,Overall everything was perfectly seasoned and nothing was too salty/sweet/vinegary. We loved everything that we ate.
,,,,,My partner has never tried bbq like this before and even he would take a flight here from CA to eat this again. 
,,,,,I would do the same after eating here. Life changing. Must eat here every time we are in Houston.
,,,,,"I come here with my family almost every time they come visit Houston. This time they had the wagyu special and it was good (little fatty for me but I think that's just how that cut is). I also got the chili for the first time and it was flavorful but a bit too oily and kinda overpriced for the serving size. I an a potato salad fiend, and I really like their potato salad and macaroni sides. Sausage is good too. They give so much barbecue sauce"
,,,,,"I was excited to try some Texas bbq and this place was a lackluster. The line was out of the door. I don't know why. Everything I ordered was just okay. I ordered ribs, brisket, puked pork. First of all you order your food cafeteria style, the guy takes his hand and grabs a handful of pulled pork out of the pot with his gloved hand, he put one pork rib on the tray like seriously one damn rib?! Then we ordered the macaroni and cheese, beans, and potato salad as the sides. The rib was not tender at all The brisket and pulled pork was okay. The sides were bland. I really didn't understand the hype with ppl standing outside in the rain for it. It's small on the inside too so it's best to take your food to go if it's busy. I felt rushed while eating, the cleaners kept asking if we were done eating as if they needed us to go so someone else can sit down. Wasn't for me but may be for you."
,,,,,"We look forward to the brisket and ribs when we are in Houston. The wait is short, atmosphere casual and the staff is friendly."
,,,,,"I've been to this joint twice now and it's the best pit bbq in Houston imo. Killens in pearland is close 2nd. The bark on ribs and brisket here is literally to die for. So so good, and the sides are second to none. HIGHLY recommend pork ribs and beef brisket with okra and loaded corn...wash it all down with a lime topo Chico and you're headed for a food coma. Enjoy!"
,,,,,The food was pretty good. The sauce was too spicy for me. I liked the taste of the meat.
,,,,,"Super yummy and tons of seating! Very fast and easy to get through the line. Also had a large variety of different smoked meats. If you're looking for some good Texas bbq, you should stop here. I recommend getting the 1lb beef rib."
,,,,,Will definitely come here again!
,,,,,"I like to judge barbecue restaurants on their smoked turkey. It's a leaner meat that often gets over salted and dried out. Pit Room avoids these flaws for a perfectly seasoned, moist, smoked turkey breast. "
,,,,,"The venison sausage is a must try, skip the beef, it's pretty standard. "
,,,,,"If you're craving beef, I think the ribs are the better option than the brisket. With a nice sweet, salty crust. The meat is tender but not total mush. "
,,,,,"No complaints on the sides, we tried the potato salad, elote and Mac and cheese. Need to try the coleslaw on another visit. "
,,,,,"Bonus - they provide single use plastic gloves to handle the condiments bar. The space inside is small, but was very clean."
,,,,,"Voted the #1 BBQ spot by users on Google Reviews and Yelp, we had to try this place! The line was long upon arrival, but they move it pretty fast (about 20-25 minute wait). The thing I liked most about this place is they cook/serve the food in front you upon ordering, and the atmosphere. There's a neighboring building next to The Pit Room called The Patio at The Pit Room where you can eat outside and enjoy that cookout feel. They have servers constantly checking on you at the patio which was real nice. They were very attentive. Fountain drinks and bottle drinks are available. As for the food...delicious! Is The Pit Room the best BBQ in Houston? Hey, I'm just a tourist. But it was really good! I give a thorough walkthrough of this joint at "

,,,,,"My husband and I were skeptical to try a barbecue place in the middle of town. We were pleasantly surprised. We tried the beef rib, brisket, and pork sausage. Everything was delicious, we believe that good barbecue doesn't need sauce. That was the case."
,,,,,"Their sauce was decent, but since you didn't need it, we were fine with it. Definitely will be bringing family and friends here!"
,,,,,"I flew from Washington State to try this place. The food was what you expected it to be. The taco briskets were delicious, however the cheese over powered the flavor from the brisket. The Mac and cheese was amazing, super cheesy. The cheso dip was really good. If your visiting the area, this is a great place to go!"
,,,,,"The beef rib (5/5!) is just about as good as it gets -- you do not want to miss this. In fact, it is literally the one meal I continuously come back for and highly recommend it. The venison sausage (5/5!) and Mac n cheese (4/5!) are two other recommendations I would encourage you to go for."
,,,,,I'm sure these guys are tired of playing second fiddle to Killen's but that is how newcomers are gauged before they're praised in their own right. BBQ speaks for itself with the standouts being their beef rib (5/5) and their brisket (4/5).
,,,,,"Note: beef rib is priced according to weight, so if you feel like eating less you may want to request a smaller rib. "
,,,,,"The turkey (3.5/5), pork ribs (3/5), and sides - spicy beans (3/5), mac n cheese (4/5) - were not memorable, which in my opinion is what really sets Killen's apart from everyone else."
,,,,,"With that said, Pit Room has brought some"
,,,,,"good BBQ to Montrose in a casual, laid back atmosphere. They own the bar next door so dining on the patio is another plus for those good weather days. "
,,,,,"Btw, does anyone know why they are always out of corn?"
,,,,,During my first visit to Texas I placed a phone order here for my first nights dinner...I had seen good reviews both written and on video so I thought I'd try this place out. Texas has a reputation for having some of the best BBQ in the US so I was excited to give this place a try. 
,,,,,"My first ""issue"" was I asked for the beef ribs and if they were still available. The lady on the phone said yes which I was happy for because I hadn't seen alot of beef ribs back in CA. HOWEVER when I got back to my place I had the pork ribs but I sorta shrugged it off and opened the rest of my food...I got the 2 meat dinner plate with Brisket and the Venison Sausage (Mac&Cheese and Potato Salad for sides)."
,,,,,Now let me say this...the sausage was the best part of the meal. 
,,,,,"The Ribs however were dry and I almost found myself eating them because they were there but being disappointed especially since this was my first dinner in Texas. The smaller pieces of Brisket just tasted like smoke, almost like if there was a chewing gum that was ""smoke flavored"" the taste of the longer pieces was a bit better but lacking any flavor except ""smoke"" "
,,,,,The sides seemed like an after thought...something maybe you could get in a deli at a super market...
,,,,,I was really let down from this place. I figured the 38$ i spent would've been worth it if A) my order was correct and B) the food was great...I wish my experience here was better but I look forward to seeing what the rest of Houston has to offer :)
,,,,,"Great food, great atmosphere"
,,,,,Can be loud - this is not the place to go if you're looking for a relaxing dinner.
,,,,,If you're looking for good food -
,,,,,"My first barbecue when I arrived to Houston and I was disappointed.  The meat was too vinegary, the sides were awful and the bread was just plain white.  Who has ever heard of such things !! I like my barbecue sweet, the sides appealing and the bread with garlic and butter. I want to order from a menu and be served at the table.  This was not for me !"
,,,,,"Great authentic Texas bbq smoked in offset wood fired smokers. Sides are great too and have a Mexican food type of infusion. Brisket was excellent, no sauce needed. The smoked Turkey also great, very juicy and tender. Overall very impressed and worth the money. It's nice to sit over in the next door patio bar, which has plenty of TVs. Also, there is street parking if the lot is full."
,,,,,"First off let me say... that wagyu beef rib was everything and deserves 6 stars. It was truly an experience and well worth the price. Now, I only gave 4 stars because  the other meats were just ok and the sides (macaroni and elote) were subpar to me. We tried the pulled pork, brisket, and pork ribs. The pork ribs were tender and had a good taste... but I tell you nothing will ever taste better than the wagyu beef rib."
,,,,,"We payed 147$ for the feast #1 and also one brisket taco. The food was okay, the brisket was kinda dry but the beef rib was really good. I feel as though it is a bit over hyped. We went right at open so it's not like we went when they were running out of the good cuts. I feel as though it's a bit overpriced for the quality but the quantity it's decent. The space is small but there's outdoor seating. There was already a long 30 min after open so go early if you don't feel like waiting"
,,,,,This place used to be amazing. I would take all visiting guests here for authentic Texas BBQ. 
,,,,,It has gotten almost inedible. We had guests in and went there: the brisket was very thin which is fine but and caked on both sides with black burnt spices. It was basically inedible .
,,,,,The pulled pork was ok but dry.
,,,,,The ribs were come and also caked with burn spices you had to scrape off.
,,,,,We all were working to s rape off the burnt black stuff and all had stomach aches

,,,,,"Houston, TX 77006"
,,,,,This place has some of the best BBQ in Houston! We shared a little bit of everything and we're not disappointed. The brisket was on point and melted in your mouth. The line can be a bit long but well worth the wait.
,,,,,"Amazing food, ambiance and service. Such a Texan inspiring place! A must of you like meats of any kind. The sides were outstanding! The green beans were out of this world."
,,,,,"They have a great selection of beers as well and the cherry pie was to die for!! Give it a chance if you are looking for authentic Texan food, you won't regret."
,,,,,I would definitely recommend this place.
,,,,,"Overrated restaurant at best! Beef rib was nothing but PURE FAT! Brisket was decent at best. The atmosphere is nothing special nor anything more ""country""/""Texan"" than a Pappas or TX Roadhouse. Besides that point it's a very small restaurant so you'll most likely have to eat outside, we didn't have to but some ppl did on a rainy day of all days. Again very overrated AND & expensive for abysmal food! Very disappointed in Houston and Texas :/"
,,,,,This place has the best breakfast tacos in all of Houston!!!!
,,,,,"Better than torchys, better than papas, better than anything you put up to it!!!"
,,,,,This was amazing and a little pricey at about $5-$6 per taco but the quality is there and the size are huge!
,,,,,"I cant eat here all the time or i will get fat, but with moderation i will be coming back again, and again, and again :)"
,,,,,Came here at 7 on a Monday night and it was pretty packed. Friends and I all got the dinner menu with either 2 meats or 3. I got the last order of brisket which was delicious. I love that the BBQ sauce is on the side and not slathered on the meat like some places. Found the pork ribs to be a bit dry. The giant beef rib however was great. Love the little salad bar on the side with tons of pickled veggies. The garlic and jalapeños went great with the meats.
,,,,,"Best BBQ in Houston! The Beef Ribs are a must!! The sides were amazing too, and everything was devoured in minutes. "
,,,,,I recommend going early around 5:30pm to avoid long lines (especially during Covid season).
,,,,,"I rarely have to downgrade a review, but this  was a terrible 2nd experience. So the first time I came I tried the beef rib and was blown away and even came back to Texas because I was craving bbq. This time I took 3 pounds worth, over 70 bucks back to California. Took it all to go and just trusted it."
,,,,,"However when I got home, we notice our beef rib was about 80 percent all Fat!! Almost no meat. Maybe I got a bad cut. I feel ripped off and embarrassed that I had my family try it and be so disappointed . I know this place can do better because I've tried it. "
,,,,,Not sure if I'll come back. The trust went away. 
,,,,,3 stars because it still had the same great service.
,,,,,"This is why I visited Texas. Big juicy options of beef ,pork, and sausage. The beef bone you see in the was $25 by itself but worth every penny. It's the type of meal that makes you think it's your birthday. "
,,,,,Even being a new costumer I felt comfortable and they guided me through the process. Every time I visit family in Houston this will always be my new guilty pleasure.
,,,,,"Plenty of parking, plenty of comfortable seating, and good food. Take advantage of the free refills and go home in a food coma because of great food porn ;) ."
,,,,,"Pit Room is one of my favorite restaurants and is in my opinion, the best bbq in Houston! I've had several items from their menu including: brisket, sausage, macaroni and cheese, potato salad, beans, corn, and their tortillas and it is all delicious (my faves though would have to be the brisket, tortillas and the Mac and cheese). It can get pretty busy, so seating might be hard to find, but there is also seating available outside and next door at the bar. This place is definitely worth the hype."
,,,,,Great food all around!! Love that they have beef ribs & beef sausage for family that doesn't eat pork.  The Mac 'n' cheese was a favorite and the Cole slaw was good too.  
,,,,,Indoor seating is very limited so choose a nice day to visit so you can sit outside.
,,,,,The service was quick and helpful.
,,,,,Food was really good.
,,,,,"I sat outside, the next building over, and had a beer."
,,,,,It was a chill spot and nice in the evening.
,,,,,Check it out; it's worth it.
,,,,,We stopped here as it came highly recommended and we wanted bbq while visiting Houston. 
,,,,,It's ok. Very very busy. Get there early or line will be out the door. They use a LOT of pepper which I feel takes away from the meat. There is pepper in every dish and on all the rubs. It creates a nice crust- which is good it just takes away from the actual flavor of the meat. 
,,,,,"The mac n cheese was ehh, and the green beans way too much pepper. The brisket, same regarding pepper crust, but it did have a nice smoke ring on it and was not tough. The ribs also had a pepper crust and were ""fall off the bone"" worthy. "
,,,,,"My big takeaway- if you like pepper- this is likely a great BBQ place. For us- we prefer the spices to enhance the flavor of the meat, vs distract from it."

,,,,,"Houston, TX 77006"
,,,,,Best BBQ for sure. Line was long but moved fast and the kitchen staff was helpful in making recommendations. Clean space and high quality meat.
,,,,,Excellent place if you're looking to enjoy quality Texas barbecue.  Friendly staff as well!
,,,,,"In my view,  The Pit Room is the best barbecue by far in the Montrose. Although I love everything on their menu,  I have to mention that their pork ribs are especially delicious,  and the meat falls off the bone without being overcooked. I also have to mention their potato salad, which is among the best I've eaten in s long time."
,,,,,I came here with the intentions of getting barbecue but ended up getting seafood because it smelled so good. I ended up getting the boiled crab and shrimp. The seasoning was very spicy and they did not boil the seafood inside of the seasoning they just poured it on top as you can see in the picture. I was also disappointed by how small the crab cluster was and the shrimp advertised on their Instagram was not the shrimp provided. The food was actually cold but I didn't send it back because I was so hungry. 
,,,,,I ended up getting barbecue tacos after. The tacos were amazing. I did have to take the brisket taco home and heat that up as well because it was cold. But the flavors were soooo good. I will come back for only for BBQ. 
,,,,,The atmosphere and service were nice.
,,,,,"Absolutely love phenomenal bbq. Never had anything better anywhere and def recommend the brisket and elote! Loved the pork jalapeño sausage and chicharrones are well worth the try!, I even ate them the next day!"
,,,,,I have gone here a couple times and love it each time. I am currently wanting to go back once again. I tried the green beans that were grilled. Oh my.  Never thought of them that way and they were awesome. The Mac and cheese was of course a hit. All the food was good
,,,,,Overall decent social distancing and nice protocols. Sucks since they didn't have much seating to begin with.  But I understand. I'd recommend to friends.
,,,,,"Went here off a suggestion. The meats were very good, sides could have been better. I had the Cole slaw and Mac and cheese but it just didn't do the job compared to the actual meats. Bar was interesting, lot of 'stuff' around but drinks weren't bad and fairly priced."
,,,,,"Ordered based on the reviews on Yelp.  Pre ordered via phone our order of beef ribs (1 lbs), brisket (1 lbs), pork ribs (1 lbs) and pulled pork (1/2 lbs).  We avoided the line and went directly to the cashier per instruction. Glad we pre-ordered!"
,,,,,"All the meat were smoked and nicely grilled.  Enjoyed the pork ribs and brisket the most.  While the beef ribs was tender and falling off the bone, it was not as flavorful as the pork ribs.  Pulled pork was good with bread.  "
,,,,,"For sides, had Mac n cheese and potato salad.  Potato salad was very tasty.  MnCheese was disappointingly bland and not cheesy."
,,,,,It was good we had takeout and ate at home as we have several brands of bbq sauce.  Their sauce was not sweet enough for my taste.  Maybe they can offer a sweeter option for those who prefer sweeter flavors.
,,,,,A very good bbq meat place that is convenient and close to home.
,,,,,"Relatively mediocre bbq for the price. Ribs and brisket were dry, sauce wasn't that great. They missed a few things in our takeout order entirely, but they were nice to refund the missing items after checking with their kitchen. "
,,,,,"Good if you're craving bbq , good atmosphere, but there are better places!"
,,,,,Delicioso! 
,,,,,Best BBQ I ever eat in Texas! 
,,,,,The line is loooooong but it totally worth it.
,,,,,"We ordered 3 meat sample with potato salad and mac & cheese as side and pull porked & brisket sandwich, everything was delicious!!"
,,,,,Definitely we will come back!
,,,,,1201 Richmond Ave
,,,,,"Houston, TX 77006"
,,,,,"I was so excited to try my first Texas BBQ and this place didn't disappoint at allllll. My partner and I are not huge beef people but they ran out of chicken and wow I'm glad they did. The brisket was tender, flavorful, and 10/10. The Mac & cheese could use some work. The potato salad was delicious. Would have given 5 stars if not for the Mac & cheese."
,,,,,Best BBQ in Houston!  
,,,,,"When you pull up and the line is out the door and wrapped around the building, you've got to believe it's worth the wait!  Despite the line, finding a table was not a problem.  The food was incredible - meats for sure, sides amazing!"
,,,,,"Fair warning though, arrive early as they will run out of most of the key meat items."
,,,,,"SOLID barbecue!! Was staying near by, and I could not stop smelling the delicious BBQ in the air!  Was able to snag most of the meats except for the brisket!  Everything was delicious and moist, and the sides were all delicious!"
,,,,,Went back last weekend to try the Breakfast Taco menu I had my eyes on for a while. Had the Pulled Pork Hash and Eggs. Only thing I can say is this place never dissapoints.
,,,,,"Wanted to eat here for so long and last weekend I was able to finally go. Best decision I´ve ever made. Everything we ordered was delicious, but  the brisket is definitely a must.  Highly recommend and can´t wait to visit again."
,,,,,Wait was worth it! We arrived to the restaurant with a line out the door. The staff was very friendly. The smell of smoke bbq was delightful! Since we didn't know what to get we ordered a little bit of everything. Everything was great! Must stop place in Houston! Definitely understand why this restaurant as on Texas Monthly Magazine.
,,,,,"Everything was delicious served was fast and friendly. We got a little of everything brisket, beef ribs, chicken and pulled pork sandwiches the macaroni and cheese and beans to die for. We stopped here on the way out of Texas definitely will be back."
,,,,,"I had a juicy rib. Personally, too fatty & not enough meat for me. Elote was good. Not too many seats inside. Not too many front parking spots."
,,,,,I'm so mad at myself for not getting any pictures. It's likely because it was such a random stop and didn't intend to get lunch here BUT I'm so glad I did. It was early afternoon midweek and wasn't crowded but there were definitely enough people grabbing lunch to let me know the reviews must be accurate. 
,,,,,"Ordering was easy since there was a team of staff assigned to different portions of the meal. First person asked about the meat choice, next person asks about sides and the last takes the payment. I got the turkey, green beans and potato salad. A meal is amazing when I enjoy everything and I definitely did. The turkey had a nice smoky flavor and was moist and tender. The potato salad was mustard based, seasoned well and tasty. The green beans might've been my favorite - they had a smoky bbq flavor and came with sautéed onions. Although the onions were a little salty, everything tasted great. "
,,,,,I'm going back and next time I'll take pics.
,,,,,We tried the Pit Room on a recommendation of an acquaintance. The atmosphere is super cute and cozy. The staff was super friendly and helpful. As well as the food was AMAZING! the pulled pork was tender and moist. The dipping sauce was tangy and flavorful.  The sides were delish. They were out of the brisket and pork ribs. Next time we'll be sure to come earlier so we can try them.
,,,,,Absolutely amazing barbecue. The brisket is so tender and has a lovely pepper crust. The jalapeño and cheddar sausage was the perfect amount of flavor and heat. 
,,,,,We chose to try out the meat in sandwich form. Barbecue sauce has a nice zip. Definitely try the homemade pickles and pickled jalapeños. 
,,,,,For our sides we tried the pinto beans and Mac and cheese. So good! The beans were seasoned so well and so flavorful. The Mac and cheese was creamy and delicious. 
,,,,,The Pit Room has a full bar but if you want something quick they have cans and bottled beer at the register along with glass bottle sodas. 
,,,,,Absolutely fabulous experience and we will be back!
,,,,,1201 Richmond Ave
,,,,,"Houston, TX 77006"
,,,,,"Got the feast for my dads birthday, and we loved it! There are so many different types of meat, but our favorite was the beef rib. It was so tender and fatty, and full of taste. Also loved the pulled pork and the sausages. Some of the cuts have a black pepper crusting, which makes it slightly spicy. Even though it was a lot of food, we heated up leftovers in the microwave oven and it was just as delicious! "
,,,,,For sides - would highly recommend the elote. The Mac n cheese was average. 
,,,,,"Overall was a great place, and well worth the money."
,,,,,Amazing food! The flavors just jump around in my mouth and the staff are nice and friendly. 10/10 would come again if I visit Houston again.
,,,,,"There are sooooo many BBQ places to try in Houston. But, a friend suggested The Pit Room as one of her faves. Wow wow wow!! This is the best BBQ I have ever had (except for family's BBQ)!! Seriously! Look at the bark and that smoke ring! Everything I ate was delicious! I had (pictured) the 2 meat dinner (2 meats, 2 sides, BBQ sauce on the side and a slice of white bread): mustard potato salad, mac-n-cheese, brisket and venison sausage. The brisket is phenomenal, and that venison sausage thoooooo!!! The line is long, but definitely worth the wait."
,,,,,"The staff was very friendly and efficient. The Pit Room has joined up with The Pub on Richmond next door to combine their outdoor seating. So, although the dining area is small, there is plenty of room outside."
,,,,,This place is so good that I'm going back tomorrow (less than a week since last visit)!!
,,,,,Some of the best bbq in city with fresh food and good servings -- open late!
,,,,,I'll be back!
,,,,,Yelp lead me to this amazing place. It was all I wanted for true down and dirty TX BBQ. I will go back anytime I visit Houston.
,,,,,"We had the brisket dinner and chicken dinner options, with an added pulled pork taco. Both dinners came with two sides. The brisket was perfect. Nice smoke flavor, fat rendered, juicy beefy brisket, just like it should be. The chicken was also delicious. Nice crust on the skin and great smoke flavor. Likely one of the best smoked chickens around. The sides were mac n cheese, which was delicious and very cheesy. The beans had a wonderful spice level to them. The dining room has an area to grab a variety of sauces, salsa, fresh jalapeños and pickled veggies to accompany your meal. The pulled pork taco is a must have! Overall a great spot to get some really good bbq!!"
,,,,,My trip to The Pit Room was an enjoyable experience. My first tip is go early because this place is popular! When we arrived the line was out the door!!!
,,,,,"After we got into the establishment, seating was so limited that I had to secure it while the rest of my party waited to order. "
,,,,,I was disappointed (but not surprised) that they were out of beef ribs. Instead I opted for brisket and chicken with Mac and cheese and mustard potato salad as sides. 
,,,,,The major benefit of the restaurant is they offer their meats in meals (with the exception of the beef ribs ). It gives an opportunity to sample multiple items without purchasing in bulk and still leave stuffed! 
,,,,,"I enjoyed the brisket although it wasn't the best I've had in Houston. It's quite palatable nonetheless. The chicken I was disappointed with: I don't know if it sat a while before we got it on the plate but it was less moist than I would prefer. The turkey was a standout, which is shocking for a Texas barbecue spot because here it's all about the brisket. This leaves me wondering what the draw is to this place??? I'm thinking that maybe their pork selections may be more impressive than what we sampled: I don't eat pork. "
,,,,,The surprising standout was the mustard potato salad! All they need is a few tips from my mom and they'd be all the way there with that!!!
,,,,,"Although I liked my meal and left The Pit Room stuffed and satisfied, I don't think I'll be passing by my favorite spot to visit them again soon. But if you're in the area it's worth a trip!"
,,,,,"Best TX BBQ in Houston! Their beef ribs were fall off the bone, melt in your mouth delicious! My daughter and I were big fans of the chips and queso too. I recommend making your own BBQ brisket nachos! I highly recommend! If I lived in this city I would definitely go back!"
,,,,,"Best BBQ in town! The brisket moist is so good, we try to go here every once in a while. The only bad thing is sometimes the line is out of the door,m but, worth it! The elote is a must try!"
,,,,,I stayed in Houston for three days and I asked around for the best BBQ in Houston.  I ordered three meat combo with two sides and a beer.  The total with tip was $40 for my meal.  
,,,,,Pros:   They are open late!  I checked and most other BBQ shops close around 2-3pm but they are open until 9pm.  We really enjoyed the atmosphere and the outdoor seating.  
,,,,,Cons:  Everything I tried was very salty and dry.  :(
,,,,,"I enjoyed the Pulled pork the best but the sausage was underwhelming.  There was a lot of flavor but again, it was too salty to fully enjoy.  I'm sorry to say but I've had better BBQ in WA."
,,,,,1201 Richmond Ave
,,,,,"Houston, TX 77006"
,,,,,One of the best bbq spots in the H. Third time going and always link next door at the Patio to have drinks with my college friends.
,,,,,"Service was quick and everyone was nice. We ordered for 5 adults and 1 baby boy. We ordered 1lb of brisket, 1 beef rib, 1/2 a chicken, 1 beef sausage, 1 pork sausage, a pint of the elote, Cole slaw, and charred okra. This was plenty of food for all of us, we even had a meal and 1/2 left over. Now on to the taste review. My favorite was the beef rib, so tender and it fell right off the bone, I was able to slice it with a plastic knife that's how soft it was! The chicken was fresh very juicy and had great flavor. Brisket was on the leaner side usually I love brisket but it did not steal the show this time. Sausages were ok, casings had a nice snap to them. Now for the sides, I'd skip the Cole slaw unless you like the vinegar based kind, I'm more of a KFC Cole slaw so I prefer sweeter ones. The elote looked great but missed on the flavor didn't have that street corn flavor I was hoping for.  The okra on the other hand was fire I def recommend this side!"
,,,,,Brought my mum here when she finally decided to visit. Service was great and the place has a slightly rustic/southern feel to it.
,,,,,Brisket did not disappoint! 
,,,,,Pro tip:They have a hella spicy unique sauce made from mustard seed (yellow squeeze bottle by the coke machine). It's dynamite give it a shot.
,,,,,I feel like I go here almost weekly. The food is amazing. Don't sleep on the chicken verde tacos. Absolutely amazing. Friendly staff and line moves quickly.
,,,,,"It's hard to describe this inner Houston BBQ joint other than amazing! With all the craze of Texas BBQ this spot has it all. Great staples like the sliced brisket both lean and moist, the burnt ends and chopped as well.  Go big with a beef rib or run on the lighter side with pulled pork or venison link sausage.  The sides could easily make this place by themselves. Enjoy!"
,,,,,We've been to the Pit Room a few times now.  This visit was Thursday evening around 7.   Surprisingly they weren't very crowded.  
,,,,,Hadn't tried the Tacos before so we ordered a Brisket and a chicken Taco.  They definitely do Tacos well & we enjoyed both but loved the Brisket as this is what they're  known for.  
,,,,,"For main, we ordered a couple of the Meat Dinners (3 & 2).   Brisket (of course), Chicken and Sausage.  Got the Czech style and Jalapeño Cheddar sausages and both were seasoned perfectly and tasty.  As mentioned the Brisket never disappoints and chicken was very good.  We also got the Mac & Cheese and Elote for sides which matched the excellence of the meats."
,,,,,Servers behind the counter are always helpful & friendly.
,,,,,One of our top spots for BBQ in the Houston Area and a must stop when visiting.  A Food Network/Cooking Channel favorite that lives up to the hype!
,,,,,- Wagyu beef rib $50 for a 1.5lbs 
,,,,,- self serve condiment bar 
,,,,,-fast seating 
,,,,,-friendly staff 
,,,,,- has a patio you can take your food to eat outside 
,,,,,- more bang for your buck in reference to food
,,,,,Only thing i didn't like from this place was that I ordered ribs and I got spare instead of baby back. 
,,,,,It's just a preference but I was pretty bummed I didn't get BB ribs. 
,,,,,The Mac and cheese is something to get.
,,,,,So I paid $119 for that tray. Worth it. 
,,,,,Don't go cheap on TX bbq.
,,,,,The brisket was EXCELLENT!  The brisket tacos were delicious and so were the pulled pork tacos.  It's a little pricey but they nailed the flavor!
,,,,,There's a reason why The Pit Room was on the top 50 bbq list in Texas Monthly. This place simply does not disappoint.
,,,,,"I ordered a two-meat plate of pork ribs and Czech-style beef sausage (other options are venison and jalapeno cheddar) along with sides of potato salad and charro beans. The true test of barbecue is whether the meat's flavor stands on its own without any sauce, and that is definitely the case here. The ribs had the right amount of moisture, and the sausage was on point as well. I do realize I prefer the jalapeno cheddar sausage over the Czech-style beef, but that's my personal preference as opposed to any kind of flaw."
,,,,,"I would have liked a bit more mustard-flavor in the potato salad, but that didn't stop it from being enjoyable. Charro-beans were likewise tasty."
,,,,,"I was also super excited to see the accompanying bar, The Patio, is back open for business with its rotating selection of Texas beers. The best option is always to order your food, and then take it across to The Patio to enjoy with something on draft."
,,,,,"Houston has a lot of good barbecue spots, but this continues to be my favorite."
,,,,,They have great bbq. All our out of town guests love the food they try here. The wait time is long at times but is definitely worth the wait.
,,,,,1201 Richmond Ave
,,,,,"Houston, TX 77006"
,,,,,"My friend and I ended up getting here kind of late so there wasn't much to choose from. I got to try some of their brisket, chicken and some slices of Turkey.  I had their grilled oakra for aside along with their coslaw. "
,,,,,"Two things that are absolutely amazing...  Their barbecue sauce and their custard pie. In my mother's New York accent... TO DIE FOR. As I'm sure the fact we got the last bit of meat that was left since we got there lateron a Friday, it didn't taste as fresh as I had hoped. Place seems always packed and again, parking can be tricky. "
,,,,,"Altogether, a solid BBQ joint for sure!"
,,,,,"I really enjoyed having my first taste of southern BBQ. My friend wanted to try some BBQ for dinner and The Pit Room was on my Houston collection. I love the space around it, they were playing the football games for the night with everyone socially distancing while eating. Ordering was super easy and the staff was so nice and wonderful. "
,,,,,"I ordered the brisket with potato salad and elote. I was so surprised at the taste of the elote, it was savory goodness. The potato salad was decent as well. The brisket literally melts in your mouth, is juicy and not dry. The BBQ sauce is more on the sour tangy side, I was expecting more sweet, which is how I prefer it. I also got a lemonade to go with my meal, it was great to have to wash down all this wonderful food. "
,,,,,"At the end, we didn't know where to put our trays and as we were getting up, a very nice man told us to leave our trays on the table and that we didn't need to clean. It's the little gestures that count."
,,,,,Great sides and an awesome one of a kind menu. The ribs were decent. They had huge bones and not a ton of meat which is why i gave them the 4 stars instead of the 5. They have great elote and mac n cheese. I highly recommend stopping here for something to grub. They have a nice setting and you can smell the bbq pit from blocks away.
,,,,,My previous experience here was eating my girlfriends leftovers from her takeout 3 meat plate a few months ago. Finally came here for lunch on a weekday and we pretty much got everything. Plenty of outdoor seating and I think around 10 parking spots on their lot.
,,,,,"The good: pulled pork, pork ribs, potato salad, beans"
,,,,,"The average: beef ribs and brisket, sausage, price/ value"
,,,,,The bad: nothing really
,,,,,Totally worth it for the pulled pork. Sides tasted like they were made in house.
,,,,,"In the words of Backpack from Dora the Explorer, yum yum yum yum yum delicioso. I've been wanting to try this place for a while, but the constant line out the door always deterred me. Friday night was no different-- we waited in the heat outside for 20 minutes before finally getting a whiff of AC. The entire time I was standing in that line, I was praying that this BBQ would be worth it. Hint: it was! "
,,,,,"I got a one meat plate with brisket, macaroni and cheese, and charred okra. The brisket was perfectly melt-in-your-mouth and I loved the sauce served with it. Macaroni and cheese was a little watery (if that's a thing?) but had good flavor. The charred okra was spicy and a little too salty.  I tried my friend's jalapeño sausage with mustard dipping sauce and it was very tasty. "
,,,,,"Ambience is no-frills. There's a soda fountain and a condiment/topping bar. There is a sign by the bar that reminded people to wear the provided gloves and use tongs, but that didn't stop me from getting a sickening look at some people bare-handsing the toppings. "
,,,,,"I wish there were a better waiting area than the 100 degree parking lot. I will be back when there is a shorter line, or when temperatures dip below boiling."
,,,,,"Imma be honest, having a beef rib for the first time and having it here made me want to move to Houston. It was just like what you think of with you watch the BBQ cooking shows. I never knew something could be so well seasoned, huge, fatty, and meaty. "
,,,,,I don't really have anymore words.
,,,,,"The wait was worth it. 5-10 minutes. The brisket melts in your mouth. The rib was very tender and flavorful. The Jalapeño cheese sausage was excellent too. Loved their potato salad, corn and green beans. They had some excellent jalapeños,  carrots, cucumbers. Their salsa was good and homemade hot sauces was off the chain. Loved their house made mustard too. There was plenty of seating even tho they were packed. Everything I ordered was under $35 and that is a bargain compared to how much other places charge for this BBq. Definitely will be back for some more!"
,,,,,"Oh, boy. Where do I start?"
,,,,,I came to Texas to sample Texas BBQ and it was definitely a delicious sample:
,,,,,"On my first day at The Pit Room I had the brisket and the Jalapeno Chedder Sausage, with sides of Mac & Cheese and spicy beans. (A slice of white bread comes with the order). I had a Corona Light for my drink."
,,,,,Wow. 
,,,,,"It was a weekday, a Thursday, so the crowd was minimal. "
,,,,,"The second day I went, I got a pound of pork ribs, that delicious Mac & Cheese, and two slices of white bread....with refreshing lemonade to wash it all down. "
,,,,,"Since it was a Saturday, the crowd was present and there was a line around the eating tables. One of the staff had to bring part of the line outside the restaurant so not to crowd us folks eating...lol"
,,,,,A popular place!
,,,,,"When I return to Texas, I want to try their beef ribs (with a side of that Mac & Cheese) which looked huge."
,,,,,"Heard great reviews about this place, so we decided to try them out while in Texas."
,,,,,"We weren't able to catch them on a Saturday because the line was wrapped around the restaurant. So, we ended up going on Father's Day. Line was a bit long but not too bad as they were good about moving the line along pretty quickly."
,,,,,"The inside was packed, so I got mine to go.  We got the three meat dinner that included two sides and I ordered additional sides. Now, they were generous with the side portions."
,,,,,"I guess since I'm from out of town, I was expecting more meat for the price tag."
,,,,,"We received one rib, one sausage, and a decent amount of pull pork."
,,,,,The ONE rib was flavorful and tender. Would have loved to have had at least two full ribs.
,,,,,"Sausage was ok, casing kinda got in the way."
,,,,,"Pulled pork was good. Had a vinager taste, which I enjoyed. Potatoes salad and Mac were good as well."
,,,,,Beans were extremely hot and I love spicy but I wasn't able to finish them.
,,,,,Elote was eh.
,,,,,"Overall, it wasn't bad but I was expecting more. Perhaps, I caught them on a off day."
,,,,,"Get the 3 meat platter.  Get it because you'll love everything that's on it.  Also, because that way you'll have your favorite already picked out for when you come back the next time . . . and you WILL come back.  "
,,,,,"The brisket is quite possibly the best I've ever had.  The chicken, the ribs, all good!  The sides are tasty and plenty of regional beers to choose from."
,,,,,While the ingredients last you can get breakfast tacos the next morning.  
,,,,,Sit inside or out.  The vibe is great either place you sit.

,,,,,"Houston, TX 77006"
,,,,,"Perhaps the best Brisket in Houston... I can't think of one thing here I sad which I didn't love. Be prepared for a possible line, it moves fast, and it's worth the patience. The pickle bar is also quite good. Don't sleep on the pickled onions!"
,,,,,We have been to quite a few bbq places in Texas (like many others) and pit room is probably my favorite so far. I love brisket and sausage and I could not get enough. They have a pretty nice indoor and out door sitting area. The restaurant is close to nice coffee shops and in a walkable area so always a good option.
,,,,,"Decided to have lunch at the pit room today with some coworkers.  I ordered a wagyu beef rib and a brisket taco.  I can't say enough good things about the taco.  The rib on the other hand was mostly FULL of fat.  From a ratio perspective, there was more fat than edible meat.  At the price point for the beef rib, this is huge disappointment.  My coworkers work quick to point out the mountain of fat left on my tray.  Bummer."
,,,,,"I am still hungry said no one who ate at the pit room when leaving. You have many options to choose from and you cannot make a bad choice. I had the beef rib with some pinto beans. It was amazing.  The outside of the rib was charred to perfection while the inside was very juicy and flavorful.  I am extremely picky with my barbecue; this did not disappoint in any way,shape, or form."
,,,,,My colleague ordered a taco for barbecue. He raved about his food. I will give a taco a try on the next go around.
,,,,,I highly recommend this place!!
,,,,,"So good! The crust on the brisket is a bit thick with pepper and smoky, which I don't prefer. But a lot of people do, and the meat underneath was very tender and not dry at all. Flavors were all so good. The elote is customizable, the chicharones with hot sauce were excellent, and you can sub them for a side! Next time I'm getting a separate order of them. The bread was homemade, I'm pretty sure and excellent. Good selection of draft beer and various bottled drinks (also soda fountain, tea, lemonade and iced coffee dispensers). My favorite part was the pickle bar with pickled hot carrots, jalapeños, cucumbers, salsa, and more sauces/fixings. Insanely good BBQ with a touch of taqueria. Will be back!"
,,,,,"Houston is a big place and location coupled with hours of operation it's definitely not easy for a visitor to get around and find everything. I personally was in search of bbq. I was looking for beef ribs, brisket and some good potato salad, beans and corn bread. After searching  what seemed like forever my husband found this place so I said let's just go. I arrived and the guy I spoke to was friendly he told me their BBQ is Tex Mex being all about the rubs and not the sauce. So I went ahead and decided to try it. I got a 1pd piece of beef ribs, a small piece of brisket and a small potato salad that cost about $40 for take out. I was told it was so good it wouldn't need sauce. It was pretty tasty but I was glad to have the sauce. The sauce was just ok as well. The brisket was smoky and extremely tender. The beef rib was tender rubbed and seared nicely with a seasoned crust. It tasted ok but the crust is not my thing. I like finger licking sticky with sauce ribs. I didn't like the potato salad at all. If you like your meats with no sauce and more of a crust this place would probably be great for you however it wasn't really worth it for me."
,,,,,"My friends and I came here two weeks ago on a Sunday evening. The line wasn't as long as it typically is so that was a plus. We finally got to the front counter to order our food. Once ordered, we got our food and sat down outside. As we chowed down, we were impressed with the tenderness of the ribs. The brisket was quite tender as well. Honestly, we all agreed that the hype wasn't all that it was cracked up to be. The flavor didn't meet the mark we were expecting unfortunately. Not sure who seasoned that batch but he flavor was lacking."
,,,,,Being in Texas we wanted some good BBQ. They did not  disappoint. There were 6 of us. We ordered a variety of meats.
,,,,,Brisket- It had a good smoke ring but a little dry.
,,,,,Pulled pork- I usually don't like pulled pork because it usually need sauce because it's tasteless and dry. This however was juicy and flavorful. It didn't even need the sauce.
,,,,,"Pork ribs- Fall off the bone, smoky, finger-licking goodness."
,,,,,Beef sausage- Nice snap on the skin but softer than I like
,,,,,"Beef rib- oh my gosh, the star of the show. It was fall off the bone tender, fatty, peppery, and just delicious."
,,,,,My daughter loved the Mac and cheese. The cole slaw was solid. Their sauce was ok nothing special.
,,,,,"Getting a table is first come first serve but turnover seems fast. The place isn't very big, however. We almost missed it while driving. Very good BBQ place, worth the effort to get out there."
,,,,,"Cost: *** portion is enough to feed two person l ordered tge 3 meats combo, elote it taste different but you can localized the main ingredients such as corn and cheese, spicy beans, bread is nice and soft and sweet"
,,,,,"Food: ***** l guess you really can't go wrong on barbecue inside texas, sausage are spicy and juicy, pulled pork are tasty and soft and meaty l like that it doesn't get stuck on your teeth because it's soft enough, brisket are made in heaven, smokey just the right amount of spice melt in your mouth "
,,,,,Service: **** just like most barbecue places in texas you lined up like in the school canteen.
,,,,,Cleanliness: **** well staffed to clean tables
,,,,,Ambiance: *** not that big of a place 
,,,,,Would you recommend it: yes
,,,,,"Justifiably famous. The four of us split the feast #1 (or whatever it's called) and did not really get close to finishing it. The beef rib and sausage were unsurprisingly excellent. The brisket though was a little tough. But the surprise star was turkey which was wildly moist and flavorful. It's a crazy thing to say but it might have been my favorite of the meats (ok it's a lie, my favorite was the beef rib but beef rib is always good). The elote side is also particularly good. My friend had the great wisdom to add some flour tortillas to our order and I suggest you do as well."
,,,,,"Very good BBQ w/a twist (a bit of Mexican flavor).... elote corn, jalapeños on the condiment bar with escabeche, & charro beans. Everything was delicious. The sauce  was a bit more vinegar than sweet. (47.00 for two), 1/2 lb pork ribs (3 bones), 1/2 lb of brisket (4 slices with good burn & smoke ring), 4 sides: charro beans (yum), slaw,"
,,,,,"& mac'n cheese (as expected), & dressed up elite (corn cut off the cob with queso fresco on top - Mexican cheese... delicioso!), & thick white bread in keeping with tradition. Like I say... what's not to love! Thanks Pit Room for a savory lunch!"
,,,,,1201 Richmond Ave
,,,,,"Houston, TX 77006"
,,,,,"Really solid BBQ spot. I have to say that I have a soft spot for the BBQ in Lockhart, but the brisket here is definitely worth it."
,,,,,"Had the brisket, pork ribs, beef sausage, and pork sausage with queso and a side of elote. They definitely go heavy on the seasoning and there's no need for sauce. Brisket was tender, pork ribs were soft and flavorful, and both improved with the unconventional addition of queso and some of their pickled onions. I thought the sausages were alright, but the brisket was definitely my favorite. I found the prices pretty reasonable for Texas BBQ, and if I was nearby I wouldn't think twice about stopping by to scratch an itch for brisket. Also, the queso was really good."
,,,,,"Inside they had some of the booths marked off, but there was plenty of outdoor seating, especially at the adjoining Patio bar where you could eat outside and not be squished up next to other patrons. Decent parking lot in the back, and even with a line out the door at around 3pm, it moved quickly."
,,,,,"Not much more to say besides please go. The Brisket and Pulled Pork Tacos were perfection. The brisket dinner is sent from Heaven lol. Even the layout with indoor and outdoor seating is spacious and comfortable. The smallest of caution is that some of the sides are spicy, but as long as you like some heat you are fine. If you want something more tame, try to potato salad or mac & cheese."
,,,,,"TPR is the business!!! Best bbq I have had in Texas. Yes, better than the one that starts with a K (not trying to get KILLed ;). Seriously this is what BBQ Should taste like. I'll just list what I got:"
,,,,,BBQ ribs 5/5 incredibly flavorful. Party in your mouth
,,,,,Bison sausage 3.5. A bit bland. Not too gamey. Tough inedible outer case. I'd skip
,,,,,Jalapeño cheddar sausage. 6/5!!! Best thing I ordered. So darn tasty and goes great with EXTRA jalapeño sides if you like spicy.
,,,,,Mac and cheese 3.5. Not great. Not bad. Creamy enough but a bit bland. Could use more sharp cheddar
,,,,,Coleslaw 4. A bit better than Aug. Needed more of a kick or spice.
,,,,,Sugar cream pie 4.5 imagine a creamy sugar cookie. 
,,,,,"BBQ sauce 4.5. Thick, spicy kick, and slight sweet and sour just like I like it."
,,,,,Service 4. Kind folks. Quick service. Could do better about spacing. The outdoor seeting area looked like a COVID death trap.
,,,,,The price is fair. 
,,,,,Final grade: solid A.
,,,,,My new favorite BBQ joint in Texas. Just wouldn't dine in right now.
,,,,,Outstanding barbecue and free smells that hit you in the parking lot and flirt with you after leaving. Just superb brisket and pulled pork.
,,,,,"When I was first introduced to the Pit Room, I had high expectations because everyone in my circle were talking about how it's amazing BBQ ribs and I would not be able to stop at just one. Turns out, they were right! The are some of the best briskets and ribs I have ever had. Not only are they juicy and full of flavor, but the meat is so tender it slides right off. That's the kind of ribs I love to eat. And what's even better about this place is that the portions are enormous. My family and I got 4 servings of ribs but we were only able to eat a third of it because of how much they give you. The price is on point while the portion is definitely worth it. One thing I have to point out is their pulled pork must be made of heaven because it is delicious. Most pulled pork I've had at BBQ joints get stuck to your teeth or the roof of your mouth but these? These are incredibly tender."
,,,,,"The Pit Room is a top notch barbecue joint in downtown Houston. I've just tried the pulled pork, which was amazing (juicy and very flavorful). Their side options are fantastic too - the baked beans were savory and delicious without being overly sweet, and the elote in a cup was fun and well balanced. I also loved their pickle bar, where you could get all sorts of pickled cucumbers, carrots, onions, jalapeños, and more."
,,,,,"The restaurant has a causal vibe. Order at the counter, then take your food to a table inside or outside. There's a relaxing energy to the place, and it's great for a group of 2-4 people. Overall one of the best barbecue options in Houston!"
,,,,,Brisket was tasty and tender - got the 1 meat dinner.  Service was quick.  Would definitely visit again for bbq!
,,,,,"As someone who doesn't eat pork or beef, this is my go to place for BBQ in houston. The chicken and turkey are absolutely amazing!"
,,,,,"Great ribs , tender and the beef ribs were huge . I guess everything is bigger in Texas like they say"
,,,,,Why is this so popular? Why does
,,,,,"It take So long to order, and then why does it take twice as long to get your entire families order?"
,,,,,Do what everyone else does and order Togo!!!!
,,,,,Wait time 5 minutes!!!!!

,,,,,[Out-of-towner Review]
,,,,,"Delicious, but won't write home about it."
,,,,,And I mean that in the best way possible if that can be. It was good. I was completely happy with every bit of everything I tried.
,,,,,"With all the Yelp stars to review ratio, I knew I was most likely in for a line. As our Lyft arrived, there was a line, but it wasn't too bad. The Houston humidity was surprisingly not too bad, so our wait didn't seem awful at all. I'd never been, but knew I wanted to try Houston BBQ since I know different parts of TX have different BBQs."
,,,,,"As the line moved and we made it into the restaurant, I took in my surroundings. The wood bench seating, the long table seating near the condiment bar, and then the cafeteria-style food line all made me smile. Then as we got closer to the food, I noticed the DDD logo on the wall. NOW all the stars and reviews made sense!"
,,,,,"You already know, your girl always wants to try all the things. So, I decided on the two meat combo:"
,,,,,Meat 1: brisket - this literally melted in my mouth and was flavored just savory enough
,,,,,"Meat 2: pork ribs - ohhh, I wanted to eat all three he gave me so generously, but I couldn't and I was sad about it"
,,,,,"Side 1: mac n cheese - gobbled it up, who doesn't love cheese and noodles?"
,,,,,"Side 2: elote - yum, love this as an option."
,,,,,"And apparently, they are also known for their tacos, so I got one too -- pulled pork. The taco was good, but the jalapeno sauce was really spicy, and I could barely handle the heat. Also, they make it on a regular tortilla, not a street taco-sized tortilla. Like, really?"
,,,,,"They have these pretty cool family combo's and I saw someone walk by with one, well two ppl carrying it all, and holy cow -- it's tons of food. Seems worth it for the price if you have at least 4 ppl. Plenty of food for all to share."
,,,,,"I loved the trough of bottled drinks but didn't get any. I also didn't get any beer or wine, which are the only adult beverages they sell. I did order a fountain soda and was VERY surprised to see the coffee in one of the stand-alone dispensers. Like, what? Cold coffee is an option with BBQ? Mind blown... "
,,,,,"I love a good condiment bar, even though it rarely has anything I want in it. HAHA, they had picked veggies (jalapenos, cucumbers, carrots, & onions), hot sauces, one not hot sauce - bourbon coffee, onions, and salsa. Oh, and toothpicks too."
,,,,,"The staff was so awesome. I jokingly said I didn't want the butt end of the rack of ribs, because he just brought out a new one. But he switched them out AND added an extra one for me. He didn't have to do that. The assembly line moved quickly, as did the cashier. It was awesome."
,,,,,"Overall, it was a GREAT experience. I'm glad I tried it and I'd tell anyone to try it once. As a visitor, I'm glad I tried this and it's off the list now. Great food, great service, and a great experience!"
,,,,,"Barely got by avoiding the meat sweats this time, Houston!"
,,,,,As always- I go for the brisket. 
,,,,,Pit room has great brisket. They use fresh cracked pepper so it is peppery. Great bark. Great brisket. 
,,,,,Can't comment on other food because: I go for the brisket.
,,,,,Quintessential divey bbq joint with a few interesting options in addition to your standard fare. (Czech style and venison sausages that I really wanted to try) 
,,,,,"Tried the brisket, pork ribs, pulled pork and sliced turkey and found no fault with any of them. The brisket was falling apart and delicious, the pulled pork was as tender as could be, the rib fell off the bone and the turkey was remarkably moist, which is something that can be hard to find. "
,,,,,"Prices about average for this type of food. 18 bucks or so for a combo with 3 meats and 2 sides. Good portions so you won't leave hungry. Quick service, friendly staff. "
,,,,,"4 stars instead of 5 because I really wanted to try the venison sausage, and the bbq chicken and they were out of both. "
,,,,,"Overall a solid bbq joint that should meet the expectations of anyone looking to grab a good, quick meal for a decent price. Would definitely return."
,,,,,"Tried the turkey, pork rib, and brisket. Would go again because the meat was moist and great flavor. Not too salty like some barbecue is. I'm shocked how most even the turkey is. It's $18.95 for a huge side and 3 meats. It's more than what I can eat so you may want to split with someone.  I teed the Mac and cheese. Loaded with heavy cream. HUGE. "
,,,,,"If I HAD to rank these 3, it would be the rib, brisket, and then turkey. It's so hard to rank them. Yes turkey was in the running, which is crazy because, again, so moist. "
,,,,,"Now I need to try the beef rib, pulled pork, and maybe a sausage."
,,,,,"Great BBQ joint inside the loop. I had to try the tacos here. Definitely did not make me regret my choice. The brisket taco, the pulled pork taco and the sides (Mac and cheese and the potato salad) were terrific."
,,,,,No issues with the parking as I arrived at 11am but could see potentially during peak times it may be difficult to find a spot.
,,,,,"Only thing to critique on is the atmosphere. While eating, me and my friend was approached by a homeless person rambling gibberish and he was wandering around the outdoor seating area and none of the employees really did anything about that."
,,,,,"OUTSTANDING! I had never in my life had Texas Barbecue before, but this place set the bar REALLY HIGH for me. I had the Chicken, Brisket and Pork Ribs with the Mac and Cheese and Charred Okra. All the meats were super good, but it was the brisket that made me say, ""I'd never had brisket the ""correct way"" before I had it at the Pit Room."" Sliced like cutting through butter. "
,,,,,"The bbq sauce is on the tangy side, and although I tend to go for the sweeter barbecue sauces, this one was really good.  The mac and cheese wasn't really my thing, because I'm not a fan of queso cheese. I'm a cheddar cheese gal. I originally sat outside, but had an issue with flies wanting to get a piece, so I recommend sitting inside. It still doesn't steer me away from how great and how special this place was."
,,,,,Simple and Sweet
,,,,,"I held out on writing a review until now since I had a not so pleasant first time but I gave it a second try and yea I can definitely see why this is one of Texas' top spots for bbq! Like all top bbq spots, their brisket is superb. Theirs is more peppery than the other ones I've tried and a heavier on the salt. It isn't overly salty but I'd skip dipping it into the bbq sauce. The ribs are St Louis style ribs so they are meatier but not as tender as baby backs. They are ginormous, savory and oh so delicious! I don't have a good indication on sausage since I'm not the biggest fan but theirs seemed alright to me. The sides are all good but the must get for me is their string beans. They have a nice crunch and its covered in pepper and drippings from their bbq meats. SO GOOD! "
,,,,,"The staff here are friendly and they are very clean. Because they are closer to downtown, the prices are higher than other places. It is still reasonable though!  There is ample parking here so there's no need to worry about that. I'll definitely be back very soon when I get my next bbq craving!"
,,,,,"First time at this place and didn't disappoint, I even decided to drop the money to get the beef rib so I could get a true taste of what their bbq was working with. Ended up tasting really good. Seasoned very well with crispy bark on outside (give the rib a A- since I have no other beef rib to compare it to) lol... green beans were interesting because they're charred and have unique taste that makes you eat more and more (B+) and elote (corn) was good too especially when you add all the toppings. (B) "
,,,,,"Overall good place, kinda pricey because the rib is sold alone which costed me $28 and the sides did not come with it. So about $35 total. But I am stuffed lol. "
,,,,,P.S.: the tacos look amazing so I'm definitely trying them on my next visit.
,,,,,"Wow this place is a gem! When we visited there for dinner during the week. It is clear this place does get very busy! We had the two meat meal, sausage and brisket with a beef rib. Wow! the beef rib is a meal in itself for one and a half people. It was outstanding. The brisket melts in your mouth. For our sides we had mac and cheese and green beans. This was plenty of food for two people and it was all outstanding. I do recommend and will visit again. The restaurant itself is not very big so plan to sit in and eat."
,,,,,"Delicious! We loved the pulled pork, the queso, and the smoked chicken tacos. Portions are large and the food comes out quickly, if you come in hungry like we did, it won't be long until you're chowing down. We were there for an early lunch on a chilly, rainy Saturday so we sat inside the main restaurant, but on a nice day the patio would be a great spot."
,,,,,1201 Richmond Ave
,,,,,"Houston, TX 77006"
,,,,,"As a vegetarian, I actually liked the food I ate. The Mac and cheese was yummy and so was the grilled green beans with onions. "
,,,,,"However you will be limited. My partner loved the meat options. When you go in, you pick out your food like cafeteria style and pay at the end which was different. Lots of outdoor seating but indoor is small. There is a bar outside connected with the restaurant, lots of TVs for sports."
,,,,,"If you're a foodie, or just love BBQ and Tex Mex this place is a must try. The chopped Brisket tacos are incredible, as are the Pulled pork and chicken tacos. Each have different fixings and are served on a handmade tortilla. Two meat pulled pork and Brisket sandwich and house made sauce is perfection and the sides of Cole slaw and Mac n cheese seal the deal."
,,,,,"Hands down, best food I've had in Houston since moving here earlier this year. Just Go!"
,,,,,"Also, great atmosphere with plenty of seating."
,,,,,I like this spot.  Good food.  Good service.  Little things make it fall short.  Meats are cold.  When you spend 22.99 on a three meat platter you want it to be hot when you get to the table.  It isn't.  Second time now.  Mac and cheese sub par.  Pretty watery.  Elote corn....just off. Pork ribs were cold in the center which made me wonder if they were fresh or reheated.  Very little beer selection.  Parking is a nightmare.  Flies were bad inside for this visit.  Really wasn't impressed this time around.  Lots of other BBQ spots that do it's better with lower prices. Maybe just an off day....not sure we would be back for a third visit or not.
,,,,,Great BBQ spot!  Got the three meat and am totally full.  Service was perfect and nothing was left to want.  I will certainly be back for this place.   I think they are definitely stealing other top BBQ spots business.  One off of Kirby I am sure is shaking in their boots!!  Great job guys!
,,,,,"Last Saturday, dark and rainy, 11:40am. We managed to get a spot in the tiny parking lot, and joined the line of patrons. We were fortunate enough to get in the door, although it was still muggy. The line snaked out the door even before noon, yet was moving decently fast - though I assume not quickly enough for the guy who, judging by the rolling suitcase, had been visiting his friends and needed to fly out soon - but clearly not before visiting the Pit Room. "
,,,,,"It was a first visit for our party of five as well. A good rule for a newbie is to try everything, which is exactly what we did with the Feast No. 2: a beef rib, 6 pork ribs, brisket, pulled pork, turkey, chicken, the three sausages (venison, beef, jalapeño and cheddar), and three sides (of green beans, elote, and mac and cheese, in our case). It's a pity the requested chicharrones fried in-house were forgotten when ordering, but I'll get it next time. "
,,,,,"The wagyu beef rib is apparently sometimes available. I had never turned down wagyu until this visit, but why anyone would triple the fat content of a cut that's already so fatty is beyond me. "
,,,,,"Keep in mind, this non-wagyu rib was anything but basic. The fat had rendered out just enough to have that near-sticky but not dried out consistency, and the meat was juicy. "
,,,,,"Remember the book The Giver and the oppressive, Dystopian mood that permeated its pages, choking the character from any liberty of expression? "
,,,,,"That's what I was starting to feel as I savored the chunks of beef. An inkling had bubbled into my mind and I wanted to let it out, yet I wondered whether I actually dared. "
,,,,,"What surprisingly added to my boldness, however, were the pork ribs. I normally don't like them much, but these were meaty, not overly fatty, and huge without relenting on flavor or quality - in a class of its own, and the best I've had. After tasting this was when I came out to the group by blurting out: I think this place is better than Killen's. "
,,,,,"I'm probably a heretic and there's now a crowd that wants to stone me, I know, I know, but what can I say? The Pit Room was spot on. "
,,,,,"As for the rest of the meal, I'll start with what I wouldn't get again. "
,,,,,"I can't speak for the chicken because I didn't try it, but what I would skip are:"
,,,,,- Turkey: juicy at first bite but I later realized it was undercooked. Killen's turkey so far has not met a worthy nemesis. 
,,,,,-  Green beans: looked really good but was severely lacking in both texture and flavor 
,,,,,- Mac and cheese: not bad and not full Velveeta but Velveeta enough 
,,,,,To recap more of the good stuff: 
,,,,,"Among the sides, I liked the mustard potato salad; the elote (corn) got an honorable mention. "
,,,,,"The brisket - which we got a lot of - was also delicious and cooked perfectly, especially the moist parts. I'm rarely a fan of lean brisket anyway, and it was okay with the sauce. "
,,,,,"Can't leave out the pulled pork and the sausages. I've never ordered pulled pork at a bbq place before, but this I'd actually order as a sandwich. Among the sausages, the jalapeño cheddar was my favorite but I enjoyed all of them. Little more tightly packed than Killen's, but that's more a preference thing and not a bad thing. "
,,,,,"The Feast No. 2 was exactly that, and we had two boxes of leftovers. Given my party of five had three men, I'd say it easily serves 5-6, maybe even 7."
,,,,,"Oh, their excellent local and imported beer selection is worth mentioning. I love it when they're available icehouse style and went with a Modelo. "
,,,,,"So yes, despite the doubt this may cast on the worth of any of my reviews, I'm here to declare this place my favorite BBQ place in town. I could backpedal and say maybe I need to revisit Killen's or that it's so much farther away, but for now, the Pit Room reigns."
,,,,,"I was visiting friends and family for the 4th of July weekend and was excited to explore the area.  When in Texas, the obvious meal choice is authentic barbeque!  Fortunately the Pit Room was open and surprisingly didn't have an insane line in the early afternoon.  We got in line was able to order within 15 minutes of waiting."
,,,,,"We arrived with 6 people and decided to share the Feast #1, which came with a little bit of everything.  Loads of brisket, pork ribs, a massive beef rib, 2 kinds of sausages, turkey breast, pulled pork and BBQ chicken with white bread and our choice of sides; we went with the mac & cheese, okra, and baked beans.  My favorite was definitely the brisket and beef rib, but everything was pretty great.  Even the turkey was incredibly moist and none of the meats disappointed."
,,,,,"Service was fast and friendly, and all of the meats, sides, and sauces were delicious.  The large outdoor patio is perfect for big groups and the beef bones are great to bring back for the puppers at home.  I'd definitely come back again!"

,,,,,Atmosphere: 9/10
,,,,,"Out of the BBQ places I've tried in Texas, The Pit Room reigns supreme. The brisket was tender and full of quality meat, no fat, just the way I like it. The most popular is the jalapeño pork sausage and it was the best pork sausage stuffed with chunks of jalapeño and cheese. There is a serving station to grab however much pickled vegetables you prefer: onion, carrots, peppers. The coffee bourbon sauce was really interesting. I actually prefer that over the BBQ sauce."
,,,,,"Je-sus!!!  That was amazing.   Nothing bad to speak of, but the Waguy beef rib was amazing!  We tried it all and got the shirt!   Amazing!!"
,,,,,"Yummy yum yum!  Back in Texas after being in Cali since November.  So nice to have some delicious BBQ.....and it's so nice to be back in Texas with the Texan hospitality!!!  I highly recommend this place.  The brisket was great, potato salad perfect, and spicy beans!"
,,,,,Great spot....another Texas barbecue restaurant you need to visit. Tender brisket & queso with chips.
,,,,,"My second favorite bbq place after Truth. This is more expensive, but you get good size portions. They have crazy-priced beef ribs, which were just ok, not bad but not worth the astronomical price imo. Staff isn't as outgoing and helpful as other places, which would be nice, I had a few questions, but alas no one seemed interested in explaining. Mac and cheese was great, brisket good, meat isn't as high caliber, had excessive black char, and more fat, which some people like but I don't, so just didn't enjoy it as much as Truth...but we come here when in the area."

,,,,,"I split a 3 meat plate with a friend. We chose brisket, pork ribs and venison sausage. The venison sausage was superb. Nice amount of peppery spice, not dry and had a smoky flavor. The pork ribs were tasty, but just ok in my opinion. The brisket was a bit salty and nothing to write home about. Our sides were elote and cole slaw. Both sides were fresh and tasty.  I've had better barbecue, but this place is not bad."
,,,,,"You can't leave Texas without trying some classic Texas BBQ and you should definitely swing by The Pit Room for this! I got 2 meats and 2 sides and that was plenty enough for 1 person. The beef brisket is so tender and the venison sausage is the bomb! Both meats were very flavorful and smoked to excellence. I honestly should have ordered some beef brisket to-go. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the beans as much. I am not someone who can tolerate spicy food that well and the beans just had way too much pepper and jalapeno in it. But this is more of a personal problem. I think if you are okay with spicy food, their beans are actually very tasty. "
,,,,,Plenty of outdoor seating available and appropriate social distancing is also in place for indoor seating. There is a small parking lot right in front of the restaurant.
,,,,,"Let me just say this, we ABSOLUTELY loved the food here!!! The food is amazing from the first bite to the very last bite!  "
,,,,,Thoroughly enjoyed the brisket. It was so flavorful and smoked to perfection!! I also tried the pork ribs and they were so tender and also perfect!! 
,,,,,Everything we ordered was satisfying!  I would say this stop is certainly worth making if you are in the area! 
,,,,,"Only complaint is that the workers seem to be irritated by use asking questions.  We made it known that this was our very first time here.  I didn't like this,  so thankfully the food made up for this flaw. The cashier was helpful and efficient. "
,,,,,"I regret that I only ate  here once during my visit to Houston -  I HIGHLY recommend adding this restaurant to your list , as the food is delicious! "
,,,,,Indoor and outdoor patio seating available.  We dined outside ; we also enjoyed this as well!
,,,,,"I said WoW after my first bite of brisket. That's all you need to hear from me to know this place is legit!?! It's now saved in my road trip Favs! The sides are so good too. I started with those to see how they fair. Well, so far this place is Fantastic! The brisket is so soft and flavorful that you need only a tongue to taste and chew it. "
,,,,,The turkey is perfectly seasoned and juicy. 
,,,,,"Seriously, all the sides I tried were great. This is not the place to brush off for another. Once you've tried the food here you'll be coming back for more and more."
,,,,,"Delicious food, i wish sausage was a bit more spicy, but everything also was perfect, love the brisket cook just right and i love their pickled onions and carrots, for sure i will come back when i visit Houston again."
,,,,,"This is the best BBQ I have ever eaten!!! I haven't actually tried too many Bbq restaurants since I live in LA but wow the meat is tender and juicy. I love the Mac and cheese side dish and the string beans! I really wanted to try the wagyu beef ribs but of course after waiting in line for an hour the people in front of me ordered the last one :(. I ordered the elote corn and really enjoyed it the first time, however the second time I thought it was a bit sour. Next time I'm in Houston I will definitely stop by again."
,,,,,"I've lived in Texas all my life, my family is Mexican, so you know we know something about barbecuing lol. This is literally the only barbecue joint I will go to in Houston. The brisket is AMAZING. It's always fall apart juicy and never dry. Also the barbecue sauce is great. I will get whole briskets from here when we have family functions, is that good. Don't waste your time going anywhere else, I don't care the other places reviews say. if you can't eat here just go get a burger or something lol"
,,,,,"Everything was delicious. Big place and we got there right when they opened. Everyone on the line was pleasant. Husband and I each got a two-meat plate: beef sausage and pulled pork for him with coleslaw and potato salad, and I got the brisket and pork ribs with elote corn and Mac and cheese. 10/10 on everything. The sauce was tangy and just the right amount of spice. Like this place was so good I'm tempted to move to the Houston area just to eat this on the regular. Oh and the pickles from the condiment bar were insane too."
,,,,,This was our first meal off the plane in Houston. We definitely over ordered for two people but the food was simply delicious. The beef ribs were so well seasoned and juicy that it melted in our mouths. The corn and mac & cheese sides were just the right blend of flavors to balance out the meat. We will definitely go back! This place also convinced my girlfriend that ribs are a beautiful thing
,,,,,"Recently ordered a cooked turkey here for Friendsgiving and was very impressed with how it tasted. I'm deducting a star from the review because the staff was unorganized and unprofessional when I came to pick up my order. I placed an order for a turkey and 2 quarts of gravy. Upon arrival, I told the cash register my name and she was clueless that I had an order placed. She looks for my turkey, which is sitting on the table next to the placed orders and hands me to turkey with no gravy. She was unaware that I even placed an order for 2 quarts of gravy and she had to ask someone about my order. During my wait for the gravy, I received no cooking instructions on how I was supposed to cook the turkey. I had to ask since it was not labeled to the turkey. [Side note: It needs to be in the oven for 1.5 hours prior to serving] Honestly, the turkey was well worth the headache of this unorganized process but I'm hoping next year will be better."

,,,,,"Will definitely return only for the Burnt Ends and the Mac and Cheese , and maybe if i have some room ill enjoy a desert !"
,,,,,"Wow! First time trying Texas BBQ and it did not disappoint. Got the two meat dinner with brisket, pork ribs, elote and Mac n' cheese. The brisket damn near broke apart like butter. I may just get a whole order of that next time! Came right at 6 and right before the dinner rush. I was able to order and get my food within 10 minutes, and as I sat down I saw the line had already piled up and wrapped around all the way outside. A must go for bbq lovers!"
,,,,,Hands down the best barbecue place I've been to in Houston. Usually there is one meat that taste better than the other but not here. 
,,,,,"Everything was so flavorful. We ordered the 2 meat plate $19.99. Now, I know that may seem like a lot but trust me it was so worth it. "
,,,,,I asked for wet brisket he happily went and got me some without hesitation. The staff were knowledgeable and helpful. 
,,,,,The green beans were smoky with garlic and onions. Delish!
,,,,,The mac and cheese was very creamy. 
,,,,,"Lastly, I normally stick to the barbecue sauce they provide, but I felt a little risky and grabbed the coffee sauce. My goodness the sweetness with the brisket, wow!  "
,,,,,I can go on and on. If you like Mexican food try their sister restaurant Candente right next door. All the smoky flavors are consistent in both places. The brisket enchiladas are my favorite! 
,,,,,Enjoy!
,,,,,The food was good but a little expensive for BBQ. We order brisket tacos chicken dinner and a salad with turkey. I was not a big fan with the chopped Brisket Tacos they seem salty. The chicken was good and my wife enjoyed her salad.
,,,,,"Bomb AF,  but damn the prices. "
,,,,,"Two meat dinner with 2 sides and subbed the chips for an extra side, along with one drink and two beef ribs = $83 before tip (which this isn't a full service restaurant FYI). "
,,,,,We got the Mac and cheese and coke slaw - cole slaw was slightly bland but that was actually a good thing since the meats were mightily seasoned (not salty but has big big flavors). Mac and cheese was pretty okay. 
,,,,,"The star of the show are the meats - they have a dry peppery rub on them - juicy, tender, smoky, and delicious. Their sauce was also bangin. "
,,,,,"All in all - the food really speak for itself. They're not cheap, but you're paying for quality food. "
,,,,,"And oh, we got here as soon as they opened and they already had a healthy line - within 30 minutes, the place was PACKED. "
,,,,,Highly recommend - this is what Texas is all about.
,,,,,"TLDR: Get the beef rib, load up at the pickle bar, avoid the dry Mac and cheese. Consider bringing an alternate bbq sauce?"
,,,,,"The meat was solidly good, but the standout was definitely the beef rib!! Brisket was solid, jalapeño sausage was fine but I've had better. I loved the pickle bar. BUT the barbecue sauce was vvvv weird - it tasted like tomato sauce mixed with bbq sauce. We actually took our food home to eat with a different sauce. Would order the beef rib and bring my own bbq sauce next time, but honestly will probably go to Pinkerton's instead"
,,,,,"ORDERED: 1 Lb. Beef Ribs, brisket, Sausage, charro beans, Mac and cheese"
,,,,,I highly recommend!!! 
,,,,,My first trip to Houston on the day before I left I got to go to The Pit Room!! The food was EVERYTHING!! 
,,,,,I ordered the 1lb beef rib which tasted WONDERFUL!!! Total for just the rib was: $28 with tax it is weighed in front of you when they cut it and you see the price when weighed. Sides:Elote made perfectly and Mac & Cheese was creamy and delicious!!! The pickled veggies options were new to me and I really enjoyed having it along with my meal!
,,,,,6/21/21 12pm
,,,,,Best bbq in the world. Terry Blacks has nothing on this place. Must get the corn and Mac! Don't forget your mango habanero dipping sauce! The brisket is so juicy. Writing this review makes my mouth salivate just thinking about it.
,,,,,"lives up to the hype!!!!! and yes get the beef bbq rib by the lb it's $$$ but worth it!!!! the max n cheese is so silky and perfectly cooked. sauce on side is  also! side homemade pickled onion, carrots and cukes are to die for.  even the bread is perfect!!! it was the best valentine dinner I ever took myself out to lol"
,,,,,"Texas BBQ is one of my favorites, anyone that knows bbq knows there are so many types and styles of bbq it's virtually impossible to define who has the absolute best and that's because everyone has their favorites and for a variety of reasons. I'm no expert even though I've eaten bbq hundreds of times from sea to shiny sea and my love for bbq covers many styles and I find no reason to say this one or any other one is the best I just try and enjoy it all. I find bbq is very subjective and we all have some bias when it comes to picking our favorites, fortunately these ""pit masters"" are prideful people and they take bbq very seriously so we are luck most are very good."
,,,,,"I came here after a friend gave me a handful of his favorite bbq spot in Houston so here's a shout-out to Justine T I appreciate it brother. I arrived here with pretty high expectations after reading the reviews and viewing the photos from a number of my Yelp friends, with the traffic in Houston being what it is I was glad to see this location was in close proximity to the hotel I was staying. I was able to find a parking space without much trouble and I was glad to see there were no lines wrapping around the building and that I was able to walk right up and place my order. The staff here was extremely friendly and it's obvious they love what they do - I was tempted to order the beef rib but decided to try an assortment to get a real feel of their version of Texas bbq and I wasn't  disappointed. I went with the triple meat platter and two sides. I love that the carving station is right in front of you and watching my portions of meats pile up right in front of me was definitely part of the overall experience. Bbq is not cheap and quality always comes at a price so it wasn't a factor I needed my bbq fix."
,,,,,The Food:
,,,,,"Beef Brisket - I loved the fat to lean ratio, the smokiness was prevalent throughout the perfectly slice portion and it was melt in your mouth tender, you could cut this brisket with a plastic spoon although they do have silverware it was really good."
,,,,,"Venison Smoked Sausage - I love sausage and although just about every bbq joint in this part of the world identifies theirs as ""Texas Sausage"" it more about the style since all are different but most are delicious and lean. I liked the venison sausage here with and without sauce."
,,,,,Smoked Turkey Breast - Smoked Turkey always gets my attention and something  I can't resist especially if it hand carved thick and it's moist. It's peppery and tender I loved it.
,,,,,"Street Corn off the Cobb - a different version for sure I chose not to get the toppings so I guess mine was more of grilled corn kennels in a bowl, flavorful and just okay in my opinion."
,,,,,"Charro Beans - Absolutely delicious, tender and spicy I could of enjoyed this as both my sides, I highly recommend this one."
,,,,,Overall a great dining experience and a place I'd return to especially since I didn't get the beef rib...

,,,,,"Houston, TX 77006"
,,,,,I love getting invited on lunches to restaurants I haven't tried before so I can properly judge them. Today's venture brings me to pit room. Ive always seen this spot but Ive never stopped by until today.
,,,,,One thing I can appreciate is how you can get all your food as soon as you order it. you can literally look at the food and order it. i love that. They also have a main meat cutter who does an excellent job cutting everything. 
,,,,,I seen they also have fresh pork rinds too which is something i've never seen at a bbq spot. how exquisite.
,,,,,I just ordered everything that caught my eye. 
,,,,,The Chopped Brisket Sandwich: I enjoyed this thoroughly. The bread is soft yet firm enough to hold the meat in the sandwich. the meat is cut small so your bites aren't a fight to chew. the BBQ sauce has a rich flavor with a subtle tanginess to it that compliments the brisket accordingly. 
,,,,,"Jalapeno Cheddar Sausage Link: I really like this. There's a perfect amount of spice to it with a cheddar presence that nicely offsets the jalapeno. If you enjoy spicy food, this sausage is a delicacy."
,,,,,The Potato Salad: Nah.
,,,,,Elote: I was surprised that they had this here. They dress it up real nicely. It doesn't have the traditional elote taste to it but it is something worth enjoying.
,,,,,"Overall, it's a fine bbq spot. I'd suggest anybody pull up here if you have time to."
,,,,,Their beef rib was bomb. Loved that they had pickled onions. They also had this coffee-bourbon BBQ sauce that was delicious. 
,,,,,I asked for recommendations for their 2-meat and they mentioned they were known for their brisket but it was kinda dry so I didn't get why that's their most popular item. Jalapeño cheddar sausage barely had a kick and wasn't very flavorful... Def would try something else.
,,,,,"Liked the elote, did not like the green beans. Also, don't get the salad, it's not great at all... I literally only got it bc I hadn't had vegetables for a couple days. "
,,,,,Would def come back and just stick to the beef rib and coffee-bourbon saaaauwwce. Bomb.
,,,,,"Delicious to say the least. Good ole Houston BBQ in its truest fashion. The brisket, sausage and tacos are beyond belief. Rumor is this place and ""Pinkerton"" are the head honchos of Houston BBQ. "
,,,,,"Only complaint I have is that this place runs out of BBQ fast. We came on a Saturday at 9pm and they were out of brisket. Then we tried again for 7pm the next day and again, no brisket. "
,,,,,"If you're gonna try this place and want to try all the meets, I'd suggest to plan ahead."
,,,,,"This place was delicious. All of the sides and meats came out perfectly. My friends and I ordered on a busy week day. The restaurant was completely packed. You can tell this restaurant means business when the condiment station is spotless. We ordered a 1 lb of beef ribs, elote, mac and cheese, coleslaw, cheddar pork ribs, and of course the brisket. We loved the brisket the most. So tender and moist. Perfect with their dipping sauces and bread. The ribs and sausages were not dry either. Definitely order the elote and mac and cheese. If you plan on taking the food to go definitely call ahead to limit wait times. If you are in are in downtown H town this is a great BBQ spot to check out"
,,,,,"Apparently the place to eat when you're in town and it did not disappoint. I was not a fan of the chewy too red for me brisket but it was not a deal breaker. The pulled pork and sausage was pretty flavorful. The line was out the door and it was well worth it. Great atmosphere, wonderful crew of polite people. Side dishes were packed with flavor and I highly recommend those in the picture as well as the corn. $70 for two combos, a 3 piece ribs and two sodas."
,,,,,"Texas Barbecue in Houston, Texas..."
,,,,,1201 Richmond Ave
,,,,,We were searching for the Best BBQ in Houston and The Pit Room was at the top of the list. Here's what we found:
,,,,,1. Free parking - a big plus
,,,,,"2. Cafeteria style - order your meats at the counter, go down the line and order your sides, pay the cashier, grab your utensil set, and seat yourself on one of the wooden benches"
,,,,,3. Condiment bar - put some disposable gloves on and help yourself
,,,,,4. The staff will take your used trays and utensils away
,,,,,5. Just walk in...no reservations needed
,,,,,"We decided to share the Three Meat plate. Since the beef ribs were sold out, we ordered the Pork Rib, Brisket, and Venison sausage. For our sides, we chose elote (corn) and mustard potato salad. Yum! "
,,,,,"The venison sausage was not gamey, but it was really spicy! The Pork Rib was on the drier, chewy side. My favorite was the brisket with its thin layer of fat... Wow! I was able to cut it easily with a butter knife! Yeah!"
,,,,,Maybe I will return with my niece - and hopefully get a beef rib... And maybe the wagyu rib which I saw as a special of the day! 
,,,,,I need to remember to try the Condiment Bar to taste one of everything!
,,,,,"I've heard about this place many a time. We stopped in on a whim and ordered a little bit of everything. The brisket  is my fave, it's tender and moist w/ a great char on the edges. They also have a bar next door called The Patio, I believe, where you can drink and have them send your food over, too. We'll be back!"
,,,,,"One of the best BBQ meat I've had.. it's quick self service then there is an amazing outdoor patio to eat and have a drink. Hearty portions. Clean and family friendly. The food came fast and delicious! The brisket doesn't fail. Juicy, tender and well seasoned. The coleslaw and mac n cheese are superb too. "
,,,,,"The vibe was chill, the employees were happy, helpful, kind & fun. Highly recommend!"
,,,,,"What a great experience for people wanting some Houston bbq. It's in Montrose, so we did a little tour of the historic downtown Houston and stopped here around 3pm on a Saturday for lunch. Man, it was packed even for a late lunch! Great ambiance with country music playing, and it's very efficient because you walk down the counter and your dish is prepared for you in front of your eyes. The only waiting is when you walk in to get to the counter. I ordered the 1 meat Dinner with Venison, Elote, and Charred Okra (the speciality item). The Venison was very flavorful and there was a lot on the plate. Wasn't super moist, but I haven't tasted Venison often so I'm not sure if that's normal. The elote was good, but the serving wasn't very big and I will have to ask for more cheese on it next time because I like it creamier (the great thing about this place is that they prepare the food in front of your eyes, so if you want more sauce of something, you can just ask). The charred okra was perfection!! Love the texture of it. The rest of the table loved their brisket & the charro beans. "
,,,,,"After you get your tray, you can head over to the condiment section, and they have selections of sauces to choose from including their coffee sauce, which had such a unique flavor (like sweet bbq sauce with a coffee flavor). We loved their pickled onions and cucumbers as well."
,,,,,Will definitely be returning - I want to try the frito pie and chicharrones!
,,,,,"Get the Dino-rib, you won't regret it! Relaxed atmosphere, great BBQ and they have fun trivia on the patio during the week as well! This is the #1 spot I tell all my friends visiting Houston check out if they want authentic TX BBQ!"
,,,,,"Houston, TX 77006"
,,,,,"I always seem to come back to the Pit Room after trying all the other ""hyped"" bbq spots. #1in my book. The brisket and sausage are fantastic! Don't get me started on the beef ribs, WOW!!!"
,,,,,"I love their veggie sides (green beans and okra). The cold bar is wonderful! Unlimited pickled veggies and fun sauces to try. I am constantly introducing new people to this place and they're hooked! It's a must try when in Houston, Tx!"
,,,,,"I didn't think there would be better BBQ than Franklin but pit room proved me wrong. It already won Franklin with better briskets and tastier sides but the caviar on top was no wait! I can't believe how long we waited to try Franklin before and now this delicious BBQ is open without any wait! To be fair, Franklin was probably the father of great Texan BBQ. "
,,,,,"My favorite has always been the turkey but the brisket here was so moist and tender, I almost had to call it my favorite. The beef rib was also super tender. The turkey was super flavorful and juicy. I wish we didn't get the chicken cuz I felt that was dry. "
,,,,,The sides were super delicious too. I was blown away by the beans - ordinary looking but packed with heat and flavor. The Mac and cheese was nice too. My little girl kept going back for more. 
,,,,,We got some to take home to LA and it held up really well. Our friends loved it. Just reheat in the oven with a bowl of water to keep it moist!
,,,,,"I've been thinking about this place a lot.  After it settle in my tummy for a couple of days.  I enjoy Franklin's, but this was a different level.  "
,,,,,Sides made it that much better.  First the wait is not as insane.  Even though you can reserve and order online now at Franklin's.  Both has meat that falls off the bone.  Brisket was dynamite it was so tender.  How tender? I brought some home for people and after reheating they said it was bomb.  This is after a 3 hr flight.  Turkey was juicy and moist.  Only thing I thought was average was the sausage and chicken.  
,,,,,"Sides the charro beans by far was a pleasant surprise, nice kick to it. "
,,,,,Charred okra was super tasty with a little burnt ends.  
,,,,,Other sides was decent. 
,,,,,"If you're in Houston, I think this is a must."
,,,,,Who doesn't love BBQ with a Latin twist? Well tbh i didn't know it was something I needed until I stopped by here. I have never tried real Texas bbq before so this was my first entry and I was not disappointed. I know I will miss bbq now that I've finally tried it. 
,,,,,The ribs were a littttleee on the dry side but still super juicy. But the brisket! Was the absolutely star of the night. It fell apart effortlessly and it was sooooo flavorful and fatty. Everything i could've wanted in bbq. 
,,,,,"The sides were okay, sometimes with American food I need something more plain to balance the immense flavor and sodium levels lol but the slice of bread kinda counterbalanced that for me. Anyways i lovedddd this place i loved the food. There is also a little self serve bar with pickled veggies that was the perfect compliment for the food."
,,,,,Stopped by here after going to the car show. The line was out the door and the parking lot was full. The restaurant gives an old rustic bbq feel. You order your food and grab it like a cafe style then have a seat. They cut the meat in front of you and select the sides you like. The food was delicious! The green beans was on POINT and the elote was flavorful. I can't complain. I definitely plan on stopping by for another plate.
,,,,,I
,,,,,"Love the Pit Room. It's one of my ""go-tos"" for taking out of town visitors to sample some Texas BBQ. I typically get the two meat plate, with brisket & pork ribs, but they also have some really tasty tacos if I'm feeling like going the Tex Mex route. Yes, I consider bbq joint tacos to be Tex Mex food... Think about it, people! "
,,,,,"So why not 5 stars?? Well, the prices aren't exactly ""great"" - although they are reasonable. I am of the belief that a lunch counter style BBQ place could trim a little bit more of the fat (har har) price wise considering the business model. But that's not my main beef (har har again)...a couple times when I've been here, hosting out of town guests the flies and/or gnats in the dining area have been extremely annoying. This is not only unsanitary but it also isn't a good look to be telling someone how great a place is only to not be able to enjoy our meal because we're having to swat at flying insects while trying to eat. One of these two things (price/gnats) I mentioned would be forgivable, however, combined they result in the loss of a star. "
,,,,,"Pro tip: Grab a Jarritos to accompany your meal. Also, the green beans are really good."
,,,,,Came here and met up with a few friends but unfortunately we met up a bit later so by the time we got there some of the meats we wanted to try were sold out. 
,,,,,"We ended up get a few varieties to share including brisket, ribs, and three different types of sausages and got to try some sides as well."
,,,,,"Brisket- was flavorful, tender, and moist. Probably one of the better briskets I've had."
,,,,,Ribs- were flavorful and moist but kinda lacked on the amount of meat that were on the ribs. 
,,,,,Sausages- Flavorful and juicy had a nice casing so even though they were cut into slices when you bit into it there was still a crunch. 
,,,,,Now for the sides: they were a bit disappointing cause in my opinion meats is the core of the meal but bad or mediocre sides can really make or break the over all experience.
,,,,,Macaroni was kinda bland and didn't have enough cheese in my opinion. The cheese that it did have was kinda watery and collected at the bottom of the container which left the noodles high and dry.
,,,,,"Coleslaw was crunchy but lacked some flavor also, definitely wasn't the best."
,,,,,"Elote... aka Mexican corn fell short. Now coming from California where we have a lot of very traditional Mexican restaurants, hole in the wall joints, and even your local corn man that serve some of the best elote this was quite disappointing. First of all all the flavor was only at the top and they didn't give enough for you to mix and seep all the way to the bottom. Second the flavors just didn't quite go well together. "
,,,,,All in all I would probably go to this place again but with so many bbq joints in the area to try I can't say it would be anytime soon.
,,,,,Brisket so juicy and flavorful. Giant beef rib was on point. Sides were aight. Def delicious and quick 
,,,,,No wait when I went
,,,,,"We may have went a bit insane on our ordering but we were all starving, and not from Texas, so we didn't want to miss out on a variety of meats we have been wanting to try! "
,,,,,The brisket taco and chicken tacos... both good but for some reason the brisket taco stood out to me the most even though I've heard ppl loving the chicken taco more. But the sauce is what makes it! 
,,,,,"The brisket slices and the half chicken were super tender moist and just so easy to peel! We also ordered the giant beef rib and OMG mouthwatering, it may have been my favorite overall bc it was easy to peel and ridiculously tender and to the bbq sauce was the cherry on top. "
,,,,,"As for the sides we got the coleslaw, Mac n cheese, and corn. I have to say the corn was my favorite bc it was kind of like elote and then the Mac n cheese wasn't grainy!  I would easily come back here, and it's a quick fast service!"
,,,,,"Wanted to try some good Texas barbecue so we had lunch at ""The Pit"" last week in Houston. We ordered the family platter to split which feeds 4 to 6, and it was awesome. I'm not sure I had had a beef rib this large or good. Brisket was good, I really liked the sausage too. We ate outside, it was a little cool but still nice. Great barbecue, great vibe, will definitely come back. Highly recommended!"

,,,,,"I've been to Local foods quite a few times, and the food is pretty consistent every time I come. The truffled egg sandwich and crunchy chicken is what we get almost every time we come here. The sides tend to change seasonally, and they are always a healthy option and flavorful."
,,,,,"What was different that we tried that I have never tried before was the Vegan Queso with vegan ""meat"" crumbles. Im not really into Vegan cheese that much because it tends not to be melted right or has a weird taste, but man this has totally changed my mind. The ""cheese"" was made from cashews I believe, and the meat was either soy crumbles or a beyond meat type product, but either way, the seasoning in it made it taste like a traditional queso. It was pretty good and we finished it before any of our other food came out."
,,,,,"If you ever come here, I would suggest trying it out. It's a play on queso but definitely flavorful and did not disappoint."
,,,,,"Thank you for your kind words! Just in case you didn't know, we have that delicious vegan queso you love, among other yummy small plates, discounted for happy hour every day from 2-7! We hope to see you again soon!"
,,,,,I had a great experience with local foods today. 
,,,,,"The food was amazing and as fresh as can be. Kerry , Houston location manager went above and beyond to make sure the food was as expected . Great food and customer service!"
,,,,,This was my first time here. 
,,,,,"Working from home with kids being in online classes with different lunch times , had no time to cook so wanted to give this a try. Paid $39 + tip for a salad and a sandwich. Not a all a good experience... salad was not fresh , stale leaves and sandwich was small and no where near what I imagined based on pictures online :(,"
,,,,,Anyways good luck as I believe in promoting local instead of corporate giants ...
,,,,,I love love love their vegan taco salad. It is packed with flavor and various ingredients. I've had it a dozen times and I am still not tired of it. I used to always get the Truffled Egg Salad Sandwich which is equally as delicious !
,,,,,"Definitely come here if you are looking for some good and healthy food! I know they're usually very busy around lunch time, so I came here for dinner. "
,,,,,Food:
,,,,,I ordered the Gulf Shrimp and Crab Sandwich and it was really good. The shrimp and crab mix worked well with the sauce that they put on it. Everything in the sandwich just really worked well. 
,,,,,Service:
,,,,,"So how this restaurant works is that you order at the counter and then they bring you your food. And once you're done eating, you can leave your dirty plates at the table. So overall, the whole experience was pretty quick and easy. "
,,,,,Atmosphere:
,,,,,"The atmosphere is great, but I know during lunch it's a bit hard to find parking. The decor is cool and inviting. "
,,,,,I definitely would recommend this place if you're looking for a nice sandwich and salad place. 
,,,,,Gulf shrimp and crab sandwich: 4 stars
,,,,,Service: 4.5 stars
,,,,,Atmosphere: 4 stars
,,,,,Great food & great service! Always a good time! Used to come here EVERY Saturday after my 3P Fitness bootcamps! A lot of new faces there now but I still enjoy the place.
,,,,,"Local foods is a very hip, trendy, health-conscious sandwich shop at you pay more for sandwiches because of the interior design on the inside. Nonetheless, I don't mind paying more for my sandwich because I love coming here to catch up with friends and the sandwiches are pretty darn good. They all come with your choice of two sides or chili and all their sides and chili are so tasty that I wish I could make them at home myself. "
,,,,,"My favorite sandwiches are the crunchy chicken and the vegetarian. The vegetarian one is actually really tasty for non-vegetarians because the curried cauliflower on the inside is thick, meaty, and flavorful. Love this place even though it's difficult to find a seat during lunch time!"
,,,,,Nothing special. Down in Houston and decided to stop by this place based on the great reviews. Everyone seems to rave about the crunchy chicken sandwich. There's nothing crunchy about it. Maybe the pretzel bun.. But even that does not have much crunch.
,,,,,My wife got the vegan meatball sub. She thought it was mediocre. Side dishes such as autumn pasta and cauliflower weren't very good either. Kind of bland. 
,,,,,Atmosphere was cool though.
,,,,,"Very good food, everything I've gotten so far from there has been very good. Quality is always is goof and portions are also good. To go orders have been great as well"
,,,,,Thank you so much for the kind words. Hope to take care of you soon.
,,,,,This location is the best!! There was a mixup with my order and the costumer service was excellent. I got a refund and even some complimentary treats!!
,,,,,Great outdoor patio with plenty of space! There is also free parking which is great. Menu has many drink options and healthy food choices. There aren't many outlets though so studying here probably won't be great. But great place to meet with friends.

,,,,,"Im famous among my friends for having too many ""favorites"", but this really is one of my absolute, all-time FAVORITES! I have never had something I haven't liked from Local Foods. Whether catered, to go, or eating there, the food is great all ways. I love the ability to convert any of their sandwiches into salads as that adds so many salad options. And when I'm ordering sandwiches, I always get pretzel bread because it is to die for.  "
,,,,,"The hundreds of positive reviews speak for themselves- Local Foods is delicious and a ""must go"" whenever you're near one."
,,,,,Thankful this spot still keeps vegan food on its menu. Easy to park and easy to order. Their speciality cocktails are always amazing. Lavender lemonade is really great. The vegan frito pie is outta this world but you'll love the vegan meatball sub. Hope one day they bring back the vegan chili and vegan gumbo. Very nice and attentive staff. Always a pleasure to visit here.
,,,,,This place in amazing great food sourced locally tried the crunchy chicken sandwich for the first time and had to go back two days later because it was all I can think about! The bread and pickles are amazing! Certainly will be back here to try more
,,,,,This place in amazing great food sourced locally tried the crunchy chicken sandwich for the first time and had to go back two days later because it was all I can think about! The bread and pickles are amazing! Certainly will be back here to try more things!
,,,,,"Absolutely love local foods. Whenever friends come into town, I always take them here and there have been zero complaints. I used to order the crunchy chicken religiously, but over the years, I've gravitated towards the garden sammie (sub with pretzel bun, add chicken), and always gotten the Kale salad side and whichever seasonal item looked interesting. Also, the posole soup is really comforting - great if you're feeling sick!"
,,,,,"Refund me my money !!!! Watery warm potato salad left outside and cucumber salad was even worse, you can tell it has been out for hours in the heat. Inside temperature felt like 80F. I have been a loyal customer for the last 5 years and never experienced quality issue. I have also taken many of my clients to lunch there and introduced them to Local Foods since they have never had lunch there before. I have been to every location in Downtown, San Felipe, Heights, Kirby and Rice Village. Every location has a glass fridge ( beside Rice Village ) where the sides are stored and once ordered taken out to be served. My stomach feels weird as well now. I am so disappointed by Rice Village location, and I don't think they have safe practices because they see so many people now they just throw everything in the basket. I wish I would have taken a picture but I was so angry about the quality and needed to go to another meeting that I didn't have time and just threw everything in the trash outside! I am never going back to the Rice Village location and will not recommend it to my clients! With these practices y'all are going to poison someone! I want my money back!!!"
,,,,,Love love love! My go to healthy & yummy  food!! They have a great gluten free selection & any sandwich can be put into a salad. How cool!
,,,,,"Cute establishment, friendly service. The sammich (I think they called it ""crispy chicken"") was delicious!! Check out my pic, and I would highly recommend. "
,,,,,I also tried the butternut squash soup and HATED it. Bleh!! It has a spice in it (maybe turmeric) that is so awful and overpowering. It was left full on the table to be thrown away. 
,,,,,I would definitely come back to sample other choices and their beer selections.
,,,,,"I have been a recurring customer and lover of Local Foods since moving to Houston 4 years ago, but as of lately I feel like they've been faltering and really need to get their stuff together. Highly disappointed! "
,,,,,"Went for lunch (before the rush) on Tuesday with co-workers and was enjoying the bahn mi sandwich, which I've ordered a few times before, when suddenly I bit down on something METAL in my sandwich. It was a a 1"" bristle from the grill brush! Lucky for me I thoroughly chew my food, because those suckers are dangerous and cause so many injuries every year! At the time, I quietly alerted an employee passing by, but didn't address much as I did not want to ruin lunch for my coworkers or draw too much attention. She was nice, but didn't really seem like she was all too surprised/concerned. The employee kindly offered to refund my meal and get me a new item - at first offering to bring me the SAME THING [ummmm no, and shouldn't you (sadly) be throwing out the loot of (needle) pork?!] - so I picked something else entirely and just got it to-go...she even threw an additional brownie in there. "
,,,,,"When I got back to work, I felt like I needed to address the matter further - to stress the danger and magnitude of what could've happened if I swallowed it and urge them to switch to bristle-free grill brushes as to not injure their patrons - so I took the time to write a nicely-worded email to the location and cc'd all the other locations, as well. "
,,,,,That was two days ago...radio silence. 
,,,,,Highly disappointed in the management for the handling of this situation. A customer takes the time to reach out to express concern and it apparently doesn't even warrant a response. Perhaps it'll take someone getting hurt and them getting sued. SMH. 
,,,,,And more importantly SO disappointed in the food quality!!! 
,,,,,"Remember that extra brownie the employee threw in...? I ended up finding 2 little pieces of wood in it. (see photo)  Sidenote: Yep, I ate it after what happened because I truly believed in this restaurant and thought the one-time would be an isolated incident. SMH X 2. "
,,,,,Sigh. Please get your act together Local Foods and restore my faith. 
,,,,,"I actually reallyyyy loved Local Foods, too."
,,,,,This is my go-to spot for delicious and healthy-ish sandwiches and salads. I have a dangerous addiction on to their truffle egg salad sandwich (I honestly cannot get enough!!) And their homemade chips & kale are the perfect accompaniments. 
,,,,,"But who am I kidding. I've never sampled a bad item on their menu. Crunchy Chicken Sandwich, Garden Sammie, Posole, Vegan Bowls, Vegan Taco Salads--everything I've eaten here has been delicious! Local Foods has been staple in my Houston lunch spot shortlist for years, and it has earned its spot!"
,,,,,"Lindsey,"
,,,,,Thank you sharing your love for Local Foods! Be on the lookout for our new seasonal items coming out next week! We hope to see you again soon!
,,,,,"Tried this place with a co-worker for lunch!! When you walk in the atmosphere is welcoming. It's a cute little spot for lunch breaks. They have plenty of seating and the customer service is exceptional. The menus are at the door for viewing, you choose what you want and approach the register to order. I ordered the ""Turkey Confit"" but on pretzel bun and it was sooooooo good!! I will be coming back!!"

,,,,,"Houston, TX 77005"
,,,,,The other locations are better and larger and more open. They're more inviting and somewhere I'd like to hang out for lunch or grab a drink on a nice day. 
,,,,,"Everything I've ever had at Local is SO good! Love the garden Sammie, quinoa burger and salmon sandiwch. I wish they'd have the lemongrass soup all year round. "
,,,,,"Really like their homemade hot sauce, just the right amount of heat and flavor. "
,,,,,Staff is always friendly and informative and helpful.
,,,,,TL;DR Fresh and healthy food that is both filling and tasty in comfortable cafe settings. 
,,,,,----FOOD:
,,,,,"Shrimp & Crab Sandwich (5 stars): A well-crafted sandwich with a sizable amount of fresh, sweet-tasting shrimp and crab meat. Not only was the meat succulent, the bread was nicely toasted such that it wouldn't scrape the roof of your mouth but still provide that satisfying crunchy bite. Has a little bit of kick to it but it is balanced well by the creamy Green Goddess dressing. "
,,,,,Acorn Squash (5 stars): Roasted acorn with quinoa and crunch green beans is delicious and makes you feel healthy and wholesome afterwards. I'm seriously stealing this combo to cook at home!
,,,,,Kale Salad (4.5 stars): Great side option with a little bit of tang and a little bit of sweetness (from the golden raisins).
,,,,,----EXPERIENCE: Friendly and fast counter service. Food arrived in about 10 minutes after ordering. The restaurant has a lot of natural light making it an enjoyable place to eat and take great photos for the Insta!
,,,,,I definitely would go back. 
,,,,,Date of visit: 2/16/19
,,,,,"Thanks for the love Caroline.  We hope you enjoy making some healthy creations at home, and we hope to see you again soon!"
,,,,,"My go to lunch spot. Love all their sandwiches, so fresh and delicious. Their galleria location is my favorite, they also have a downtown location."
,,,,,I remember trying Local Foods for the first time years ago and strongly disliking it (think I had a Garden Sammie). My friend convinced me to try their Crunchy Chicken with their hot sauce and it changed my life. I'm addicted to it now along with the yummy pretzel bun it is served on.
,,,,,"Aside from that, I also enjoy the salmon bagel but I hardly ever get it. My absolute favorites include the crunchy chicken (no pickles though) and the Truffle Egg Salad. The best thing is having someone to split both with and having them half and half...yummm. "
,,,,,"This place doesn't make me feel guilty for pigging out minus the portions being huge but I usually get a sandwich with chips and fresh fruit. The other sides are pretty good as well but just not for me, maybe one day I can appreciate them more but I think they're made pretty well! "
,,,,,"I suggested this place to my friend who is vegetarian and he really enjoyed this place and the selection it provided as well! I think the fresh ingredients and service are always a plus. But their home made hot sauce? I think that's what truly won me over lol. I wish they sold them by the bottle because it tastes like a spicier, more garlicky Sriracha without the sweet tang."
,,,,,"I love every single thing about this place!! Great people, amazing space, yummy locally-sourced food, and cute puppies if you are sitting out on the patio ;)"
,,,,,"My bf and I went here on a slightly rainy Thursday evening and had a wonderful time. I got the Garden Sammie (a slightly different version of the Market Veggie they used to have) on a pretzel bun, and the bf got the Gulf shrimp and crab sandwich. Both the sandwiches were very yummy and the fillings came through in every bite :) :)!! As for the sides we got the watermelon, Tuscan kale, pumpkin seeds, and acorn squash. The acorn squash was something new and tasted delicious!"
,,,,,"Overall, Local Foods is a great spot in the Village and is doing things right with locally-sourced ingredients!!"
,,,,,This is a great local and healthy restaurant. The service is great and the food is very unique. 
,,,,,"I ordered the Crunchy Chicken Sandwich with the Tuscan Kale and Soba Noodle side dish. I loved the sandwich and they were not selfish with the amount of shredded chicken they put in the sandwich! The only thing that I didn't like was that it was a little too sweet for me. It tasted really great at first but then after a few bites, I stopped eating it. I'm not a huge fan of sweet and savory. The tuscan kale tasted amazing. Though, the soba noodles were very bland and slimy in texture. I do not recommend getting the soba noodles. I also got the Blood Orange Mintade drink, which is quite bitter yet addictive. "
,,,,,"Overall, great spot with a unique menu and I highly recommend going here if you're just hanging out, on a lunch break, or want something to-go that is healthy."
,,,,,"Love the vegan power bowl add tofu, and coming from a total carnivore, that's high praise. Even my husband can't believe I would crave the vegan power bowl."
,,,,,This place lives up to the hype!
,,,,,I'm so surprised that I've not written a review to my favorite food place in Houston as I was compiling my list. I've been here 3 times now and this place does not disappoint!
,,,,,"Their season's harvest salad got me rethink that salad can actually be worth $10. The porkchop burger on pretzel buns with apple and kale, among other noms, was a positive reinforcement on my tendency to order food with seemingly strange combination of ingredients. The crunchy chicken sandwich was also delicious. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the side with the soba noodle, which was much too smushy for my liking. Though, to be fair, I'm pretty picky with my Asian noodles."
,,,,,"Hands down, my favorite restaurant in Houston thus far."
,,,,,"That crunchy chicken sandwich truly does grow on you. I wasn't sure how I felt about a cold chicken sandwich the first time I had it, but the pretzel roll that it came on was amazing. I tried it a second time because of the roll and liked it even more. "
,,,,,The chicken is lightly seasoned allowing for the crunch and the dressing to shine through. The pretzel roll truly is phenomenal. It is served warm and is delightfully soft. I did try it as a salad but don't believe I will be opting for that again. Love the pickles to add a tart bite as well. The atmosphere is relaxed and the outside patio is cozy on a nice day! Looking forward to my next visit!
,,,,,Local Foods is always delicious! The crunchy chicken sandwich is a must every time! Come hungry :)

,,,,,The absolute best place!! I've never we had a bad meal here. My favorite is the crunchy chicken sandwich
,,,,,"After 2 days in a row of leaving the hospital and going by taco cabana bout of convenience, my body was screaming for real food and for greens in particular. Trusty yelp brought up Local Foods when I typed in salad and looking over their menu got me excited. I called in my order, asked the guy on the other end what he would suggest and he said he could go on and on about anything cause it's all great. I got the harvest salad and because I was starving decided I needed a side of the kale salad and beet salad as well. "
,,,,,The salad was huge and so freaking delicious I can't even stand it. Citrus goat cheese and Brussels  with pomegranate seeds?! Get outta here!! I hope one of these comes to Austin. The smaller side salads were both very good. All of this healthy amazingness for under $17!  I'm gonna try to go back before I leave Houston. UPDATE- I went back. The black bean quinoa burger is so good! The chips were kinda greasy but good taste and their brownie is so moist and delicious!! I went back on day 3 for the harvest salad... I might go back tonight for another burger ‍
,,,,,"Also while I got mine to go, the interior of this place was SO cute! Def a healthy, cute option for dining! Highly recommend."
,,,,,Visiting Houston and friends recommended us this place for lunch.  It is a comfortable place with ample space for everyone to have a comfortable meal and conversation .  
,,,,,"The food is also very good.  The portobello mushroom sandwich had plenty of mushrooms and the combination of flavors with the sauté veggies made it an enjoyable dish.  The chicken pozole does not taste like a pozole (I grew up in Mexico and eating pozole), but still a great tasting soup.  "
,,,,,Highly recommend this place if you are in the Rice University area
,,,,,"Delicious food, a little pricey for what you're getting but I knew that going in. I will definitely return"
,,,,,"As a vegetarian, Local Foods is an amazing place for people like me. The amount of variety of vegetarian and vegan options is great! From sandwiches to salads to soups, everything is unique and tasty. "
,,,,,"I've been here multiple times and always get the Garden Veggies Sandwich, but this time I tried the Salad. The salad was a salad... the green dressing was a bit sour yet tasty. There was fruits: dragon fruit, strawberries and greens included in the salad. Although it was overpriced, I still got it. I would say it was okay and definitely think the sandwiches are more worth the price . "
,,,,,My group of friends decided to sit outdoors because the weather was gorgeous. The outside seating was nice! Theres fake grass on the floor and lights on the top. I will say there were a lot of pigeons and Gnat's flying around.
,,,,,Usual costumer here and the chicken sandwich is to die for! However this time I came in and my girlfriend came along. She got the shrimp and crab sandwich and it was AWFUL. The shrimp and crab tasted very fishy and not fresh AT ALL. I would recommend this place for this chicken sandwich but DO NOT get any seafood from this place because they clearly have a bad dostr

,,,,,"Everything here is so fresh and delicious. The service is great, the inside is clean, and I love that is restaurant is environmentally conscious. I order the shrimp and Argula salad and it was amazing! Very filling for a salad. They didn't skimp out on the shrimp either!"
,,,,,Thank you for sharing your visit with us! We hope to see you soon to try one of our new dinner features!
,,,,,Whether you're in the mood for delicious or healthy - or both! - Local Foods has something for you. 
,,,,,My go-to items are:
,,,,,* garden Sammie salad with chicken - delicious fresh and tasty ingredients 
,,,,,* crunchy chicken sandwich with pretzel bun - yummmmm
,,,,,My friends also really like the shrimp and crab sandwich. 
,,,,,"The restaurant is baby and kid friendly with high chairs, and it's pretty noisy inside so no one will get too horribly offended by a crying baby or kid. "
,,,,,There's also a covered outdoor patio with counter and table seating. 
,,,,,There's a shared lot with other restaurants that gets full during peak hours.
,,,,,"Nice little posh spot to stop in for a quick bite, lunch, brunch, and a to go.  I've always gotten the gulf seafood sandwich with chips and potato salad or soba noodles.  Service is always good and the restaurant is always very clean.  Never had a bad experience here after 4 years and will continue to support them."
,,,,,"I love this spot! So many great, healthy options. The crunchy chicken sandwich is a must, but I also love the cobb salad. They also have a bar!"

,,,,,"I love Local Foods.  I love love love it!  We eat here at least once a week, we know everyone, everyone knows us. The vegan lasagna with is the Thursday special is so amazing.  Meat eaters in my family love it too.  Their soups are good, their salads are good, sandwiches, everything!  The only thing I don't like is that I'll fall"
,,,,,"In love with something on their menu, and the poof!  It's gone."
,,,,,When I made the switch to live a healthier lifestyle this place helped me through it. They have many great options and everytime I have gone it has been CLEAN !!
,,,,,"This place is amazing for fresh (farm to table) and delicious food. I have been here twice for lunch and the food, flavor, and service is amazing. Lots of delicious options to try. Plenty of parking outside, seating inside and outside."
,,,,,I was thoroughly impressed with the Market Veggie sandwich. It's not your typical veggie sandwich by any means and I loved every. single. bite!! 
,,,,,"The sandwich had shaved cauliflower, roasted brussel sprouts, hummus, avocado spread, sprouts, tomatoes, and probably any other fresh veggie they could find..all between a perfect ciabatta bun! Man, my mouth is watering just thinking about it again! "
,,,,,"I really like that they have a lot of vegan options, including desserts!! The vegan brownie was super good and moist!! "
,,,,,If I'm in Houston again I'll definitely stop by!
,,,,,"I don't really take the time to write reviews but I currently have several dietary restrictions and  the manager Robert provided the best customer service we have received here in Houston! He was incredibly understanding, accommodating and overall just awesome! Thank you so much again Robert!!! My husband and I truly appreciated your help and the food was delicious!!! We will definitely be returning!"
,,,,,"Initially received a burnt, dry salmon. After speaking with the manager, Kiko, he immediately addressed and resolved my issue creating a memorable experience with, a much better Pastrami sandwich! Will definitely be back!"
,,,,,"I cannot say enough good things about Local Foods. Only downside is that finding parking can be hard during normal meal hours as Local is so popular! My friends and I love coming here when we want a nice, delicious but also healthy meal out. It's within walking distance of other Rice Village shops and really close to the university. I love the interior of the restaurant (the decor, the lighting, the colors, everything) not to mention the AMAZING food. My personal favorite is the garden sammie as a salad with chicken added. I literally am drooling just thinking about it (the blend of the curried cauliflower, the pickled onion, the hummus spread all together in the salad is to die for)...please try it!!! I also love all of the sides or the house soup that come with a sandwich order, but if I had to choose, I'd recommend the tuscan kale and red potato salad. Other menu items that I've tried and raved about are the truffled egg salad sandwich, the spring harvest salad, and the asian chicken salad. I know that people usually think someplace with as many good reviews as Local Foods is overrated, but believe me, it's not."
,,,,,This place is always bomb. The crunchy chicken sandwich is my favorite and a staple in their menu. I also really enjoyed the little market that they had during Covid to help out people in the community. Thank you local foods!
,,,,,"Not that this place needs anymore great reviews or hype, but it is lives up to all of it! "
,,,,,"Firstly, everything here leaves you feeling good, nothing is too heavy but there are also extremely generous portions so you'll definitely be filled and/or have leftovers! You can tell that all of the ingredients are fresh and healthy, and everything is so simple but has such a unique taste!"
,,,,,My personal favorite is the crunchy chicken salad with the kale side. I've heard great things about the drinks too!
,,,,,"In town for work, a coworker in knowing I am a vegetarian picked this place ; and the only bad thing I can say about it is the fact that they do not ( hopefully it's just a yet) exist in San Antonio !!"
,,,,,"Amazing menu and it was hard to choose - went with the vegan power bowl which was amazing and enough food that I was not hungry come dinner time . It had a delicious rice component , beans also delicious and loads of fresh veggies!! The table also tried the jalapeño hummus which was so good it did not last long !!"
,,,,,I also love any place that has kombucha on its drink menu and loved their available flavor complete with chunks of fresh grapefruit !!
,,,,,Cool space with indoor and outdoor eating - great fast service ... please come to San Antonio next

,,,,,Fancy sandwiches and Rose wine! ~~
,,,,,"I like this Local Foods location better than the one on Kirby, namely because its right next to Benjy's and the atmosphere is a little nicer (if you order some wine, it feels pretty fancy). Also its little more tucked away (in Rice Village!)"
,,,,,"I would recommend the Crunchy Chicken Sandwich (sweet, crunchy, savory, love it!) and the tuscan kale salad on the side. The vegan chili is also pretty good and the avocado BLT was lovely (only suggestion  would be to use a nicer bread on the BLT!)"
,,,,,"Overall, a great place to grab a lunch with someone special or with a group of friends. And again, if you add some wine, it can make for a  nice dinner as well!"
,,,,,"We're glad you enjoy our restaurant! Be sure to check out our happy hour, everyday from 2 to 7 ($5 glasses of wine and various tasty starters for only $5 each)! We look forward to seeing you back soon!"
,,,,,"Ordered the vegan meatballs, red potato side and corn. One of the best vegan meals I have ever eaten. Usually when trying vegetarian/vegan foods at restaurants I feel that it is an afterthought. That is not the case with the 'meatballs'"
,,,,,Bread was fresh and perfectly toasted. Good size portion and well seasoned
,,,,,"Local Foods is great! The sandwiches are great and they have really big portions. The sides are super unique. Also, everything is super healthy! The prices are kind of on the expensive side so get ready to pay $9-14 for a sandwich and 2 sides. Parking wasn't terrible. However, the seating inside the restaurant was an issue. There was just so many people eating here for lunch and barely any seats left. Other than that, our service was spectacular! "
,,,,,What I ordered:
,,,,,Avocado BLT w Dill Pickle Spears & Potato Salad - 4/5
,,,,,"The sandwich was good. It was on sourdough bread, and it had some bacon, lettuce, tomato, and avocado. It also had some sort of sauce that really complimented the sandwich as well. The sandwich was very basic though, it didn't have that wow factor that really said ""I would totally get this sandwich again"". For the sides, pickles are pickles. The potato salad was hands down the best thing on this dish. It is so good and so unique. 10/10 would recommend the potato salad."
,,,,,"Love the Local Foods concept. Clean eating that is locally sourced. And the food is always, always tasty. They usually rotate menu items every few months, but there are always plenty of vegetarian items. My favorite is the sandwiches. Every sandwich I've tried here has been delicious and flavored perfectly. The sandwiches come with two sides. It is a bit on the pricier end for sandwiches, but you won't be disappointed! "
,,,,,"This location can get busy on weekends, but the parking lot is large for a restaurant in Rice Village. They share the lot with Thai Spice and Benjy's."
,,,,,"Local Foods is my GO TO restaurant not just in Rice Village, but in Houston. I try to bring all of my visiting friends to Local, and every single one has loved the place. I have tried nearly every one of the sandwiches, as well as most of the salads. My favorite dishes are ranked as follows:"
,,,,,"1. Garden Sammie (with Pretzel Bun): The Garden Sammie is an incredibly flavorful vegan option that even meat-eaters will love. It has curried cauliflower, crispy, brussels sprouts, and marinated onions that give it a lovely tang. While the ciabatta is tasty, the pretzel bun is truly the star of the show when it comes to bread options at Local Foods. I get this sandwich consistently, and have never been disappointed."
,,,,,"2. Vegan Taco Salad: Flavorful, dense, and great texture. The vegan taco ""meat"" is well seasoned and generously incorporated. It also comes with an entire half avocado."
,,,,,"3. Harvest Salad: Brussels sprouts and goat cheese shine, with a zesty dressing. A great option if you're looking for a lighter salad for lunch or dinner."
,,,,,4. Avocado Toast: Great as a small bite; they add marinated onions and some tasty chili flakes. Can't really go wrong with this one.
,,,,,"5. Chicken Posole: Fantastic texture, and refreshing for a soup because the lime is forward. Soup is slept on by the general public."
,,,,,"6. Crunchy Chicken Sandwich: It is a crunchy. chicken. sandwich. Often thought to be the best item on the menu, which could be due to the great ranch."
,,,,,"7. Tuscan Kale (side): Great marinade softens the kale, which is complimented by parmesan. I get double sides of kale every time!"
,,,,,Local Foods continues to serve fresh food at a reasonable price during the pandemic. Great for a quick lunch. It's also a great place to roam around and shop at their little bodega.
,,,,,Thank you for the support and for visiting LFM (our newest addition)! Please ask for Robert of Vinny on your next visit to our Rice Village location so we may do our part to make it 5 stars!
,,,,,So my cancer is back and hubby is fussing that I need to eat better. Because of my chemo meds my potassium and magnesium levels can get dangerously low. Advice from the nurse eat foods that are high in those sources.  
,,,,,"We weren't far from local foods so we popped in to check it out.  I love portabella mushrooms so that's what I opted for. Hubby got the shrimp and crab meat sandwich. He had NO complaints.  Me I had a couple. My bread was toasted but just a little too much for me, but that's just my preference. Next time I'll remember to ask for lightly toasted. Second it was spicy. I believe that it came from the aioli but I'm not sure because the ingredients did not list anything spicy. Third, the description said it had some pecans (sorry I don't remember the exact wording on the menu) never tasted them. I tasted the mushroom, onions, salad (believe it had mint in the mix, yuck made it taste funny). Now the sides I had were the potato salad, and pasta salad.  Potato salad was delicious could have used more, pasta salad just as good, good Greek flavor, beware the  kalamata olives have the pit in them so do be careful taking big bites. You don't want to chip those pretty teeth!   "
,,,,,"As for hubby all I got from him was a big ""YUM"" !"
,,,,,"I was looking forward to coming here, because I had heard great things. I came at about 2pm on a Saturday and it was busier than I thought it would be. The sitting situation is tricky. You either are able to get a ""private"" booth table, or need to share a long table space with other people outside your group. We were able to sit at a booth table, although it felt like we were at the same tables as the other people on either sides of us. This is not a place to hold a work meeting, have an even semi private conversation, or a quiet one at that. The tables are so close together that you will find yourself trying to talk over the conversations on either side of you. "
,,,,,"I ordered the bacon, egg, and steak sandwich, which was supposed to have a fried egg on top, with shredded steak. I substituted the jalapeño bun for a pretzel bun. For my sides, I chose fresh seedless watermelon and the pasta salad. The egg on the sandwich was fully cooked- nothing fried about it, and the steak tasted more like salted jerky than anything. It was a complete disappointment, and overly salty to the point that I could only eat a quarter of it. Thankfully I had the watermelon to try to balance out the saltiness. I wouldn't recommend this sandwich at all. I ended up leaving here still hungry and not at all satisfied."
,,,,,"I visited Local Foods for the first time today and was extremely impressed. The interior was very nice and absolutely pristine. Additionally, from the moment we walked in, staff was welcoming and helpful. We actually had a hard time trying to figure out what we wanted to eat (despite the streamlined menu) because everything looked so good. I settled on the ""Crunchy"" Chicken sandwich with pickle spears and fresh fruit. My wife ended up with the Gulf Shrimp and Crab sandwich with homemade chips. They we're both phenomenal. I don't mean just good, I mean crazy, mouthwatering awesome. The sandwiches were both stuffed and the sides were also delicious. One plus is that we got to enjoy a nice early afternoon in the shade of their patio, which offers a pretty decent view.   "
,,,,,"Overall, I can't say enough good about my first experience with Local Foods. I will tell you that I liked it so much I seriously considered going back for dinner the same day. Check it out!!!"
,,,,,Came here for a casual lunch and the food was absolutely delicious. I got the sandwich of the day which happened to be a lobster roll and I got it with a side of corn salad and potato salad. Everything including the bread was so good. It was definitely beyond my expectations. They are being extremely careful during the COVID phase. You are required to wear a mask to go inside the store to place your order and there is some patio seating available for you to dine there. Definitely the best spot for a casual meal in rice village.

,,,,,"The food was really served fast and everything was fresh , I loved the outdoor seating that was available under the umbrella! It was no nice to enjoy the view, customer service was okay!!"
,,,,,One of my favorite places to go for lunch or an early dinner!
,,,,,"Their sandwiches (specifically, their Bahn Mi, Garden Sammie, & Crunchy Chicken Sandwich) are MY FAVORITES! I'd highly recommend grabbing one of those and either a seasonal side soup or the Chicken Pesolé soup."
,,,,,The vibe is great as well definitely casual. 
,,,,,I see plenty of people in small groups or even alone! 
,,,,,Everybody loves Local Foods.
,,,,,Thank you so much for sharing your love for our store! We look forward to seeing you back soon!
,,,,,"I love Local Foods! I ordered the Garden Sammie with pasta salad and the Tuscan kale, and it was delicious. The whole meal was extremely satisfying, but it didn't feel heavy in my stomach afterwards. The ciabatta bread was so well baked and was super fluffy on the inside. Very well seasoned and tasty!! The overall ambience of the restaurant is super welcoming and rustic."

,,,,,One of my favorite spots for lunch. Healthy sandwiches with an outdoor area where you can bring your pets as well.
,,,,,This was one of the only meals in Houston where I let someone else in my family pick the restaurant. My dad picked Local Foods for lunch one day and I'm glad he did! I'm going to let other people plan things from now on :) 
,,,,,The parking lot was super crowded during the lunch rush. We came in around 1-1:30pm and it was hard to find a parking spot/table to eat at but a little bit of patience is good to practice! I'd say the same concept was needed for finding a table after ordering our food. 
,,,,,"Fresh nourishing food perfect for lunch - Salads, soup, sandwiches."
,,,,,The food here is fresh and consistently good. It can be pretty pricey for a sandwich and sides (especially considering that the fresh fruit I got was a small clementine one time) but it's good and I keep returning. I'm obsessed with the pretzel bread. I like the seafood (crab/shrimp) sandwich best. I ate The crunchy chicken one before as well but it's just OK in my opinion. 
,,,,,I got dessert for the first time with my lunch yesterday and I'll never not get it again. The cookie was LIFE and I'd like another one. Now!
,,,,,"Really enjoyed our experience here. Friendly staff, cute seating options, and great local and healthy options. I've been trying to get my parents to venture out a little with food choices, adding more veggies, grains, legumes. This place had great options, and my parents really enjoyed their meals. Win win!!!"
,,,,,"Local Foods is always a good option. This cafeteria-style spot offers a revolving menu, in addition to their standard list of salads, sandwiches, and sides. There's also a fun (and local) craft beer list. As of this review, I've been to this location countless times and have always ordered the crunchy chicken sandwich served on a pretzel bun. Just great. Everything is remarkably fresh and the service is super friendly."
,,,,,"WOW chef Mike, amazing HAPA sandwiches!  I know it sounds crazy saying,  a egg and tuna sandwich with homemade bread could be a ok combo. BUT LET ME TELL YOU,  All I can say is WOW!  Also the Korean beef and chicken Katsu  were equally amazing."
,,,,,"I dig this place. Tasty foods, and they have vegan options."
,,,,,"My sister and I stopped by here for a healthy lunch while we were in the area. They were rather busy and I was afraid we wouldn't be able to find a table. We went to the counter to order and just after I paid, a table opened up. I knew it was meant to be mine lol. A lady quickly cleaned it off for me and BAM! I claimed it."
,,,,,We both really enjoyed what we ordered and vowed that we would return to try other items because there were lots of tempting options.
,,,,,"My ONLY complaint is that the booths are made from a weird vinyl that made it hard to slide in and out of the booth. They're comfortable to sit on, but difficult to scoot on. My sister and I both felt this way and I think the people before us had that problem too because they were sitting on the very edge of the seats. Not a big deal though. I'll be back!"

,,,,,Excellent food! Take it out though unless you want to smell like a deep fryer. I don't know how people done inside!! The smell is strong!
,,,,,I always feels so healthy eating at a Local Foods. Plus it is delicious.
,,,,,"My go to is the crunchy chicken sandwich. The sandwich consists of layers of chicken, seasoned tomatoes and lettuce, pickles, ranch, and crushed salt and pepper chips. The combination of flavors really complement each other so well. The absolutely star of the dish is the pretzal bun. It is both soft and a little bit crispy at the same time and the flavor is so wonderful. This sandwich needs a heavy duty bun to keep everything in line and this pretzal bun is up for the job."
,,,,,Sandwiches come with two sides. The sides differ from location to location and I believe they also change depending on what is in season. I ordered the summer pasta (pasta salad with cherry tomatoes and olives) and the potato salad. The summer pasta is good if you like olives (if you're into that kind of thing). The potato salad was incredibly refreshing. It had a nice dill flavor and felt so light.
,,,,,"Important tip: you can ask for a pretzal bun on any sandwich, it really kicks it up a notch!"
,,,,,This is a Houston classic. The crunchy chicken sandwich with kale salad can't be beat. The cocktails are also delicious and the ambiance is wonderful!
,,,,,"I was looking for food around Rice Village and this place was on my bookmarked list so there's that. I asked around what the best sellers and such and so I ended up with a shredded steak and gouda sandwich for my friend and a smoked salmon sandwich for myself. There were so many sides to choose from. I picked a beet salad, potato salad (hard pass) and the butternut squash soup. The guy at the register three in a free cookie for us first timers. Drool. "
,,,,,"Okay--the taste of the smoked salmon was a winner. I knew I was already ordering that based off of someone else's review. So that was a good bet. And then the soup was SO good. I've never had butternut squash soup and have always been too chicken to make it myself, but now that I know it tastes like THAT, I'm emboldened. My friend's beer salad was good but had him on the toilet all night and the potato salad recipe should be redone. It was like cold sweet potatoes and corn. Hm. "
,,,,,A little pricey too. 26 bucks no drinks but they're local. So points for that and the hospitality.
,,,,,"When I'm looking for high-quality, delicious, quick and affordable food this place is always my go to. They have a great selection of plant-based and meat containing foods. The patio is very large and well shaded. They also have delicious seasonal drinks. We had the watermelon agave and it was lovely."
,,,,,"Great service, atmosphere and food. Anytime I'm in Houston, I will make sure to stop here. Their shrimp crab sandwich and twice fried fries are so good!"
,,,,,Best lunch spot in Houston by far!! Great vibe with great food and drinks. The crispy chicken sandwich was awesome and there twice baked fry's complemented everything we've tried so far. Can't wait to go back.
,,,,,I got crunchy chicken but it was not crunchy. It is OK place to grab some sandwich. Other than that there are limited options. But I realized some locations have different menu items.
,,,,,I was quite pleased with this restaurant and plan on going there again! I had the quinoa burger and my friend had the seafood sandwich-both were excellent as well as the white bean soup and the sides of kale salad and broccoli quinoa salad. The staff was very accommodating.  The only things I would add is that they brought my friend's sandwich/soup out way before they brought my quinoa burger out
,,,,,"The Banh Mi is my go-to, and I get it as a salad versus the sandwich, but both ways are great! Their soups are all delicious, and kiddos love the PB&J on pretzel bun!"

,,,,,"One of my favorite lunch places! I usually go here during lunch because it's close to my work and my coworkers and I love it! Walking into the restaurant, the menus are on the left hand side on a stand and there is usually a lot of people standing in that area so it's kind of difficult to know if they are in line or not. Ordering at the register is super quick and efficient and the employees are friendly. After ordering, grab a table and wait for the food to come out. The food comes out pretty quickly which is great! "
,,,,,"For starters, we order the Vegan Queso. It is AMAZING. It tastes like a regular queso. I am not sure of the exact ingredients that makes the queso vegan, but we found tomatoes and caramelized onions in the mix. Order more chips though because they barely give you any. The chips are also very good. For my entree, I ordered the Vegan Taco Salad. It was also very good and consisted of lots of veggies and protein! "
,,,,,I cannot wait to come back and eat lunch here again!
,,,,,"Local Foods is the best! I love their crunchy chicken sandwich and order it almost every time I'm here, but they have many other great options on their menu that are healthy and flavorful. The sandwiches come with two sides - I usually get kettle cooked chips and fruit, but their potato salad is also very good. The restaurant itself is very cute and there is plenty of seating inside and outside, but it can get crowded at peak times. Parking is usually not an issue."
,,,,,"Thank you kindly for the support, kind words & your 5 stars! We hope to serve you again soon, and please come by and check out our new concept ""LFM"", a market and bottle shop with a chef select menu!"
,,,,,This location has Mom's Chocolate Cake from Benjys/The Classic which are temp closed due to Miss Rona. IYKYK and if you don't you better find out! Am I annoyed that it's not at any location closer to me? Absolutely. But am I going to keep coming to this one just to get that cake? ABSOLUTELY!
,,,,,Thank you so much. We appreciate your supporting us during this hard time. We hope to see you soon in the future.
,,,,,"The Pretzel-Bun. Honey, listen. GET IT. Now I am a lover of bread, but just saying I wish I could have all my sandwiches on this bun. It's sooooo good. Bae and I randomly stopped by for lunch one day were were thoroughly pleased. I had the Egg Salad sandwich (great) and he had the Steak sandwich (great). We both had the chicken soup which was also very good. Our food came out quickly and the staff was friendly (and allowed us to sample the soup prior to buying). We have no complaints and will be back!"
,,,,,"I think I'm in love...or at the very least addicted. Out of the dozens upon dozens of times I've been here, never once have I been dissapointed. The food and service always on point. Fresh ingredients at reasonable prices. Pigging out without feeling guilty. It doesn't get any better than that! My recommendation is to go for the Garden Sammie with chicken (or without for you vegetarians). Who knew a vegetable sandwich could taste so good??"
,,,,,"If I had to have a gripe with this location, it would be finding parking and seating can be a hassle during peak times. But to me, this is just a testament to how amazing this establishment is!"
,,,,,"I tried the seasonal sandwich consisting of Roasted Chicken, Brie, Provolone, Arugula, Cranberries and toasted on wheat bread. It was such a great sandwich and I especially loved the chicken. The Red Skin Potato salad was yummy too! I ordered and paid online and it was ready when I walked in. Easy peasy!"
,,,,,Highly highly recommend the garden sammie - absolutely perfection!! Husband got the chicken sandwich and loved it! Their prices are great foe the quality and quantity of food. Highly recommend!!
,,,,,"Still a great sandwich place, just wanted to update with my favorite sandwich - gulf shrimp and crab. This sandwich is so delicious! There's a really generous amount of seafood and the bread is always pleasantly toasted. I've tried this sandwich catered and in-restaurant, and would recommend the latter (it's just better fresh). I also tried a few more sides - the kale salad is amazing, delightfully fresh and seasoned. Still love the housemade chips, but I wasn't a huge fan of the sweet potato side."
,,,,,"I've been here a few times now and Local is definitely one of my new favorite sandwich places. I don't normally go out of my way to buy sandwiches (I prefer making them myself, and if I spend money on food it's for something I can't make). Regardless, Local's offerings are a bit out of my skillset so I was excited to try the Crunchy Chicken sandwich here."
,,,,,"Suffice it to say, this sandwich is pretty freaking awesome. The chicken is always fresh and soft, and the crushed chips and nut seed crumble offer just the right crunch. It's become my go-to order here, so much so that I don't feel a need to try anything else on their menu. I've tried the chips, fresh fruit (which they switch up seasonally), and beet salad as sides so far. I'd recommend them all, though the chips have a certain bitterness I don't always care for."
,,,,,"Local's one of those places you try every few months if you don't want to drop $12 on lunch. Overall, a pretty solid offering and a great place to get lunch with friends. Service is good, the venue is pretty (the outside patio is great in good weather), and it's just down the street from Rice Village but with its OWN parking lot. What more do you need?"
,,,,,"Got the truffled egg salad sandwich with the cucumber salad and potato salad as sides and everything was amazing. My friend got the crunchy chicken salad sandwich with a kale salad and potato chips and she also said it was all great. The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is because I ordered to go, and they must've missed placed my ticket or some thing, and took over 15 minutes to make my order. I was on a time crunch because my friend was on her lunch break, but other than the mishap everything was great. Will definitely return"
,,,,,Stopped by after an appointment and had the French Toast. It was amazingly delicious!
,,,,,"Thank you kindly for the support, kind words & your 5 stars! We hope to serve you again soon, and please come by and check out our new concept ""LFM"" a market and bottle shop with a chef select menu!"
,,,,,I love me some Local Foods and I love this location in Rice University.  I think it's the coziest location out of all and great for lunch or an intimate dinner with friends.  
,,,,,"Local foods always has friendly service, and it's an easy drive from the Med Center.  I ordered a salad to-go recently and it was colossal and amazing.  My go-to is always the Veggie Sammie AS A SALAD (no charge), and then add chicken."
,,,,,"I am obsessed with this salad - crispy Brussels, sprouts, hummus, avocado, curried cauliflower, tomatoes, and pickled onions all orchestrate to produce a symphony of flavors and textures for your mouth...all whilst being healthy and good for you.  I love the way their chicken tastes too - always so soft, tender, and tastes like chicken from chicken noodle soup.  The dressing is light and lemony.  I love it!"
,,,,,Local Foods keeps me from moving away from Houston it's so good.  I just can't quit it.
,,,,,2424 Dunstan Rd
,,,,,"Houston, TX 77005"
,,,,,"Umm how is this 4.5 stars? My bowl had stuff that was not on the menu in it. My friends sandwich made her stomach hurt because of the flavor alone. And frankly the only good things were the apples, coffee, and teas, but that's probably just in contrast to the sub par food."
,,,,,"Interesting market--specialty ""foodie"" foods...great hostess gifts but impractical and minimal for normal day to day.  Mgmt is friendly and welcoming. Nice lunch and dinner order-at-counter menu. I wish they sold basics like eggs and milk and Murray's style cheeses and charcuterie."
,,,,,"Thank you for visiting and for your kind words about our staff and menu! We are grateful for the feedback on our Market offerings as we are looking to provide what our guests are wanting. Next you are in please ask about any products that may not be displayed, we do have some items we can provide from our kitchen's stock."
,,,,,"Cool sandwich and salad place (and mini-market)! Came here on a quick lunch run and picked up (1) a shrimp arugula salad and (2) the cobb salad. Both are HEFTY salads with lots of filler! Probably one of the more satisfying salads around for the money. As the salad does lean on the bougie-er end, prepare to pay a little over $10/salad, but it is quite filling! "
,,,,,"While waiting for your order, you can walk around and check out their wines and other little goodies. There's enough to keep you entertained while waiting!"
,,,,,"I can't believe I've never written a review for this place because I absolutely love Local Foods! I've come here multiple times since I've moved here and it's always been widely recommended. We come here for hang outs, birthdays, meetings, dates etc. It's really a one place fits all situations type of place. I think it's due to its healthy reputation, clean and accommodating interior, and delicious food."
,,,,,"If you've never been here, you MUST get the crunchy chicken sandwich because there are times that I will literally just crave this specific sandwich. This is the only sandwich I ever thought was worthy of delivery. The chicken is tender and moist, they add house made chips for crunch, and they have a great sauce that doesn't make the sandwich soggy. The bread is a high quality fluffy bun. How did they manage to make a sandwich that's both delicious and healthy?"
,,,,,"Their other sandwiches are also great and I've always meant to get one of their salads. I'm not a salad girl, but Local Foods salads are generous, hearty, and include fruits and nuts which makes the salad infinitely better and satisfying. All entrees also come with 2 sides or a soup and their sides are also healthy and tasty. "
,,,,,Also wanted to let you know that there's outdoor seating that's really nice when it's not too hot out!
,,,,,"I absolutely adore Local Foods. I've been to several locations around Houston throughout the years and have enjoyed each one. Check the specific menu for the location you plan on visiting, as they may vary some. I promise though, you'll love any one and anything you try. My personal favorite is the Truffled Egg Salad Sandwich. If you hear ""egg salad"" and think, ""boring"", I challenge you to try this one from Local Foods! It comes on a pretzel bun and is to die for. The next time you go back, try the ""Crunchy"" Chicken Sandwich. Also a great one!"
,,,,,"Wow, crunchy chicken sandwich add bacon-- where have you been all my life?  This is really delicious.. Comes on a pretzel bun which is warm and has just the right balance of hardness to it. Flavor is really good and overall pretty healthy and not too heavy. "
,,,,,"My review here is for delivery service. Its pretty consistent and fast. Ordering online via apps pretty straight forward. Sandwich comes with two sides. I also tried their carrot cupcake and that was pretty good too. On the healthier side, but still a good flavor (perhaps like a muffin)."
,,,,,Go for some of the food and great service 
,,,,,Be forewarned that the homemade chips have no Old Bay Seasoning as advertised...very disappointed 
,,,,,The homemade Pickles do and are really good
,,,,,"Such a cute spot! Love the energy, food and finds. Supports small businesses which is such a huge plus! This spot is also very unique with food options, you won't find one like it! Amazing job y'all! Also very welcoming. (:"
,,,,,"My friend had been absolutely r a v i n g about this place. She said it was so good, she ate here two days in a row. Curious about the hype, I came here for dinner with her and another friend on a Thursday evening. It wasn't crowded at around 5:30p, but later into the evening it definitely started attracting more people."
,,,,,"I ordered the Bacon Steak and Egg sandwich with beet salad and sweet potato salad on the side. I have to say that the sandwich was amazing, albeit an artery-clogging risk. In it were skirt steak, applewood bacon, runny egg, and spicy aioli all on a bilillo roll. The beet salad was sweet, but can be a questionable choice for some people. The sweet potato salad was really good and creamy. "
,,,,,"One of my friends ordered the Garden Sammie, which I think I'll get next time I'm there. I did not know a vegetarian sandwich could be so good. The curried cauliflower had a lot of flavor."
,,,,,"I had a really positive experience here, from the atmosphere, the service, and the delicious sandwiches. I will definitely return."
,,,,,Parking situation: on-site
,,,,,"One of my favorite restaurants in Houston. I order it multiple times whenever I'm in town. My go to order is either the crunchy chicken sandwich or the truffled egg salad sandwich. Both come on a pretzel bun, have fresh ingredients are unique and packed with flavor. They also come with two side of your choice, I usually get house-made chips and the Tuscan kale salad or a side of fruit. I believe you can also order a cup of soup instead. This is a place I take everyone that comes to visit houston too! A must try in my opinion."
,,,,,"Thank you for sharing your visit with us this week! We hope to see you again whenever you are back in town, and we would love for you to check out our uniquely curated market next door! "

,,,,,Pricey. But great ingredients and ambiance. Fresh selection. Nice beer and wine list.
,,,,,"Thank you, we are glad you enjoyed the experience and hope to see you in our upstairs Wine Bar next year for more great beer and wine options!"
,,,,,Quinoa salad was not my favorite flavor wise. Chicken sandwich was pretty good and the chips were great. The sides all tasted ok my fav were the potatos and slaw. Not rating it high bc flavor wise i don't know if i really enjoyed their food and for the price idk if it was worth it since i didn't like it.
,,,,,"Haven't been since before the pandemic, but I always remember the food being great! Love the seasonal veggie changes, etc. Food is always fresh too! Can't wait to come back!"
,,,,,"Pretty good! We got the Crispy Chicken Sandwich, Quinoa Burger, Harvest Salad, and Salmon Salad. My favorite was the salmon salad - the maple glaze was terrific and the salad was very filling. The vinaigrette was also very good. Will be coming back here sometime! I also love the mini grocery store in the shop."
,,,,,Vegan Options for the Win!
,,,,,"My wife and I enjoyed a delicious Vegan Taco Salad & V MacNCheese, & to finish it off, a phenomenal Vegan Brownie! So good!"
,,,,,"This was a great experience, wonderful & helpful customer service, & we had the best patio view! Can't wait to go back!"
,,,,,Thank you Local Foods Rice for having vegan options!
,,,,,Love Local! Food is amazing. Our favorites are the crunchy chicken sandwich and the garden sammie as a salad. We always order extra chips. Love the market concept they've added during Covid and the new larger patio at the Rice Village location.
,,,,,Local Foods has an awesome pop up market now!
,,,,,"I came in @1130 am and was one of the first people there. I think the owner welcomed me in.  The workers all wore masks.  They have packaged food to go including beef curry , chicken shawarma, and their outstanding crunchy chicken .  Also yummy cheese plates!  And a menu for the day.  It got busy noonish."
,,,,,"Their boxes of fresh veggies $30 looked so fresh and colorful.  I was very tempted today!  Too big for one person, but nice for two or more."
,,,,,They also have toilet paper and paper towels!
,,,,,I scored a big bottle of hand sanitizer!  Other cleaning supplies like give boxes!!
,,,,,They also have a huge selection of alcohol on the tables.  
,,,,,They even had sparkling water from Italy - frizzante which is so effervescent!    I bought 3 cases so excited to share with my parents and my boyfriend too.
,,,,,I bought about $150 of food and groceries just so happy to support local business.  The owner and a worker carried my boxes of water to the car.
,,,,,Please stop by.  I'm sure you will find something tasty plus pick up some groceries too!
,,,,,"Takeout was so easy and fast! Friendly service. Got the truffled egg salad sandwich with potato salad, orange, and cranberry lemonade. Liked everything; very filling yet not heavy. Good place to go to for good food without the guilt."
,,,,,"I've tried the crispy chicken sandwich and house chips recently.  I liked the sandwich, but it wasn't what I imagined, if you know what I mean. The house chips were crispy, and I was given more than I would have needed. Overall, I still prefer the truffled egg sandwich combo I got before, but I'd love to continue to explore the menu."
,,,,,So good. Love their sandwiches and the huge selection of drinks! Super fast service too. Outside patio perfect for a date!
,,,,,Thank you for visiting us in Rice Village! We will be opening our upstairs lounge and patio again next year as well.
,,,,,Cute concept--- poorly executed. Came here with 2 friends since it had such good reviews... i was not at all impressed. All 3 of us ordered different things on the menu and nothing we ordered tasted good. No one even came by to ask us if everything was okay. Would not come back here.

,,,,,"Fun sandwich and salad place. My favorite thing to get here is the garden sammie with ciabatta bread. There's brussels sprouts and cauliflower, and you can pay extra to add some chicken. You can also have the garden sammie as a salad which I've tried before."
,,,,,"The crunchy chicken sandwich is a crowd favorite here, but I felt that it was somewhat overrated. Definitely prefer the garden sammie for sure."
,,,,,"The sides here are not as fresh as the ones at Mendocino Farms so I think I'd prefer there to here, but Local Foods is definitely a solid option!"
,,,,,Best salad ever! I ordinarily do not order a salad but I was just feeling the salad love on my visit. I was not disappointed. It was beautiful and tasted fresh and good.
,,,,,"Avocado, cucumber, tomatoes,shredded chicken,boiled egg and so much crumbliest bacon ever. The mustard dressing was very good and although I would usually use an oil and vinegar, the mustard was a nice change."
,,,,,"The lettuce was fixed in a chopped California style which I really loved. I mean nobody likes getting a big stalky hard piece of lettuce in their salad which so many restaurants give you, which I never understand. This probably was the most perfect BIG salad I have ever ordered. I could not finish the lettuce parts, but I did fish out all of the goodies and were they delightful. This place is vegan friendly but for others you can also find something on the menu for your tastes as well. Even if you are not a salad fan you may love their salads. They have more than 1 to choose from."
,,,,,"Local foods is one of my go-to spots when I'm craving something fresh and healthy! I love that all of their salads and sandwiches are full of super unique, flavorful combinations of ingredients. I also love how you can turn any sandwich into a salad - I almost always get the garden sammie as a salad, which is literally one of my favorite things I've eaten in Houston. "
,,,,,I also love the general ambiance of the restaurant and the fact that it has a store inside! It's super fun to shop around while waiting for your food.
,,,,,"Nice ambiance, indoor and outdoor seating. "
,,,,,"The food is not for me, the truffle egg salad and the veggie burger were not spectacular. The potato salad....I should have known to not even try restaurant potato salad."
,,,,,Best thing for me was the pretzel bun. These I could eat on their own. 
,,,,,I guess it's just an acquired taste...may be back to try other items if friends want to go.
,,,,,Did a takeout during COVID-19 and Local Foods still tastes amazing as always. Got seafood crab sandwich with kale salad and red potato salad. A little bit pricey but worth the tag!! (Strawberries mine)
,,,,,"The inside of the store turned into a grocery store, and it's SO fun to spend time there looking at a wide selection of items available, but beware as it's also very expensive. They're trying to pay rent and stay afloat, I guess."
,,,,,First time stopping in and so surprised I hadn't been here before. The truffle tuna salad was so yummy. A beautiful and refreshing space.
,,,,,"Avery, thank you so much for dining with us, and for your positive feedback! Looking forward to serving you again soon!"
,,,,,Local Foods provides a much needed healthy option and a wonderful
,,,,,Neighborhood meeting place.
,,,,,"Local foods is hands down one of the best restaurants in Houston. It is a perfect brunch, lunch, and casual dinner spot for nutritious food and impeccable ambiance. I always get one of their salads (can't go wrong with any), but their sandwiches and sides are also"
,,,,,"I had the Asian chicken salad. The flavors were amazing. So fresh and delicious! I love a good glass of iced tea, and they have a very nice iced tea. Even gave me a to-go cup as I was leaving at no extra charge. Next time I make it to downtown Houston, I'll be sure to go here again!!! Great staff as well, very attentive, fun and friendly!!!"
,,,,,"Had lunch here today and I tried the avocado BLT with spicy aioli and fried egg... so good!! The veggies were fresh and crisp, the fried egg cooked just right, and the spicy aioli gave the sandwich a good kick. For sides I had the house made chips and the Tuscan kale salad. The kale was delicious and I was tempted to order more to go, but I was so full due to the generous portion size of the sandwich. "
,,,,,The place itself was nice and clean and had plenty of seating. Pretty good customer service too.
,,,,,2424 Dunstan Rd
,,,,,"Houston, TX 77005"
,,,,,"I loved Local Foods in Rice Village! Order yourself at the counter, not much wait time, ample seating with an elevated feel to it. Nice option for last minute brunch. Tons of vegan options (eg vegan sushi, vegan sandwiches, vegan brownie) & a local grocery inside w food from around the world -- lots of organic & vegan items"
,,,,,"Solid spot that serves ""healthy"" food options with fresh ingredients. In the era of COVID, the indoor dining area has been transformed into a pop-up market with lots of fresh locally sourced produce and other cool items like alternative meat products. I've always appreciated the atmosphere and overall values of this establishment and they've managed to continue to stay true to that through these unprecedented times."
,,,,,Dining open outdoors on the patio. Hand sanitizer available. Plentiful parking in shared lot with neighboring establishments.
,,,,,It was my first visit and the lady taking my order was helpful in sharing some of her favorites. I decided on the avocado BLT; and chose the kale salad and house made chips(great seasoning)for sides. The sides were pretty good but the sandwich was really amazing. Get extra napkins because it is overflowing with ingredients and great flavor! 
,,,,,"This spot is adorable, small and intimate inside, but has outdoor seating in the front and back. Social distancing was fairly easy on a Saturday afternoon, the environment is quiet and inviting for a nice meal. Parking is close, free, and easy. The restaurant and bathrooms are clean and you can tell they put thought into the decor, which isn't necessary but always a nice touch!"
,,,,,"Thank you for your support and kind words! We are updating our interior over the next few weeks, but the outdoor seating is still available, we hope to serve you soon! Try the BLT on our Toasted pretzel bun next time ; )"
,,,,,The absolute 180 this place took! I loved it before but I'm so very impressed with the new remodeling. I love the atmosphere AND the wine shop on the second floor! The food was lovely and I couldn't complain. The new set up easily resolved the previous issues with lack of seating and long lines. I'm very happy this change has been made. The outdoor patio is also just so inviting.
,,,,,"Local Foods has never disappointed me. Always great service, food is quick to come out, and a wonderful menu with lots of options. Crunchy chicken sandwich is the best! A great place to catch up with friends for a glass of wine and big salad. Pro tip - ask for double Tuscan kale as your sides (you won't regret it)."
,,,,,Thank you for your support! The kale is one of our most popular items for our staff as well! We are remodeling our upstairs Lounge area now and look forward to providing another area for friends and fun soon!
,,,,,I usually go to the LF on san felipe and haven't been to this location in almost 2 years but read that this location got a new chef or new menu items so my boyfriend and i decided we had to try it since it's one of our favourite places to eat and let me tell you YOU MUST GO! Their new menu items are amazing and creative! The food was so delicious. The employees were also super nice and (i believe it was the manager) gave us some cookies to take home! Definitely will make the drive to come to this location from now one!
,,,,,"Dined in for lunch on a summer Wednesday afternoon and it was perfect, no longer need a mask if you're vaccinated :) .I think they maybe recently did some remodeling but the decor on the inside is very modern and comfortable. Sandwich size is always very generous and pairs great with the potato salad. Ordered at the counter and waited no longer than 15 mins for the food to be brought to us. Will probably be back soon!"
,,,,,"Picked up lunch from here on a warm Wednesday afternoon. The online ordering process was very seamless and straightforward. They're doing some construction right now but there's a dedicated pickup zone. They provide utensils upon request which I also found convenient. I got the Garden Sammie with chips and potato salad and my friend got the Avocado BLT. As someone who isn't vegetarian or vegan, I wasn't expecting too much from the Garden Sammie. However, it was absolutely delicious. The portion is very generous and I recommend getting it on the pretzel bun instead of the ciabatta. I think meat-eaters would equally enjoy it. The only downside for me, as a college student, is the price. Two sandwiches without drinks came out to $30 after taxes and tip. It's great if you have the budget, but it's more of an occasional splurge otherwise."
,,,,,"Ahhh, I would eat lunch here at least once a week if I could!!  As a vegetarian, they have lots of options. Here a few at any favs"
,,,,,Strawberry lemonade 5/5 sweet and tasty but tart also!
,,,,,"Garden veggie 4.5/5 I love it w Brussels (for a while I was getting some weird stale eggplant bites in my sandwich - an availability thing). I add the hot sauce and it gives it that final touch! I do wish they had another flavor or sauce to add, but still soooo tasty"
,,,,,Taco salad 5/5 - sooo manu flavors and tastes in this salad and I love it! One time they out the hot vegan chili on the side and I really prefer it that way
,,,,,"Mushroom quinoa meatball sandwich 5/5 - this sandwich is hearty and so flavorful I love it! They are large veg meatballs (no soy meat crap) with marinara sauce and some pesto, it is so good! "
,,,,,Kale salad that comes as a side - just get it!! So delish
,,,,,Chips side - 3/5 oily but still good.
,,,,,Great locally sourced ingredients 
,,,,,Crunchy chicken sandwich with house chips are the best.
,,,,,Lots of interesting sides - try them all.
,,,,,Food was absolutely delicious. If you are craving healthy and on the go food. Rene by the cash register was a class act. It was my first time and he made it the most pleasurable experience ever. I would recommend this place to everyone.  And you bet I will be back soon.

,,,,,"Been here so many times over the years! This week, I got the gulf seafood sandwich with sides of the Tuscan kale and potato salad, as well as the Buddha bowl. The gulf seafood sandwich was good, but not the best I've had here. (I really like the crunchy chicken sandwich and the truffle egg salad sandwich.) I wish there was less shrimp and more crab in it. The Buddha bowl was good as well, though I wasn't a huge fan of the pickled ginger, which was also in the sandwich. (I prefer their spring harvest salad.) I will always get the Tuscan kale as one of my sides--it's that good. Fresh, with pine nuts and I want to say parmesan or another grated cheese. The potato salad is pretty good too--light but hearty. Side note: Local Foods is great for group orders! They individually labeled our orders."
,,,,,"Well, my review is mixed but based on my latest visit yesterday, the salad is lacking quality and freshness. I've ate here before and usually order a salad and it's actually my go to for salads but it failed me this time. I think it might be due to renovations happening inside but it's hard to return back from what was served yesterday."
,,,,,Thank you for sharing your atypical harvest salad experience. I hope you give us an opportunity to serve you a proper Harvest salad with the farm freshness you've had before! - Vinny
,,,,,Fresh is the word I think of when I hear local foods. Very clean eating and fairly quick as well.
,,,,,Thank you! We are glad to have the local farm partnerships we have and our Chef’s enjoying showcasing the quality of those ingredients.
,,,,,"Wow this place was delicious!  I don't remember it being so good but they knocked it out of the park with the posole, crunchy chicken sandwich, and garden sammie. Had a Hispanic coworker try the posole and she said the flavors were spot on. Everyone liked their crunchy chicken sandwich. The garden Sammie was the surprise of the day. It was so flavorful and the bread was perfect. I'm so happy with this vegan item."
,,,,,"Thank you kindly for the support, kind words & your 5 stars! We hope to serve you again soon and please come by and check out our new concept LFM a market and bottle shop with a chef select menu"
,,,,,"Nice location and decor, food's fine. Not something I crave but always hapoy to have.  A little pricey for what you get."
,,,,,I love Local Foods. Their posole and the crunchy chicken sandwich are my favorite things on the menu. I love their seasonal items too! This is one of my go to restaurants when I'm meeting up with friends.
,,,,,"After a long long time of lockdown , am back to this on of my fav food stop in town. "
,,,,,"Masks mandatory, they had a pop up store of fresh vegetables in a basket for $30."
,,,,,"With local stores just about opening up, there was hardly any crowd when we reached- maybe because we were there at 10.30, almost exactly when the store opens. "
,,,,,"We friends met up at Herman Park, walked 6 feet apart with masks on and went to Local Foods totally hungry- with no patience to eat at home we just made a table of the trunk of the car and ate right there - still maintaining the 6 feet distance - It was just funny but fun !"
,,,,,"We got the vegan meatball sub which was like a quinoa falafel bruger, the garden sammie  and the truffled egg salad - which we made into a sandwich. The sides to go with them were chips, kale salad, pumpkin seed salad, red potato salad, and a couple of strawberries for dessert . Phew! Got the whole list I hope. So glad that the food was exactly the way I remembered it to be- fresh, tasty, not too hot or dry- just right."
,,,,,Am coming back !
,,,,,One of the yummiest and healthiest meals I've had in Houston. I ordered online for pick up and everything was ready in about 20 min. 
,,,,,The salad I got had so many flavors and was filling. My husband said that it's the best egg salad sandwich he's ever had. We also tried both vegan soups and they did not disappoint. The space is large and has both patio and indoor seating. I also thought it was cool that they sell speciality foods and drink to take home with you.
,,,,,Got the crispy chicken sandwich and it was great! The potato salad is awesome and very delicious pickles. The watermelon lemonade was also great. Good portion size! Cute restaurant and a great lunch spot.
,,,,,My husband and I stopped in on a weekday for a quick bite to eat. Their inside dining room had just opened back up but we still opted to eat on the spacious patio as it was nice weather!
,,,,,"It's counter service style so you order your food, they give you a number and you find a seat. I ordered the crunchy chicken sandwich with potato chips and kale and my husband ordered the BLT with the chicken hominy soup. Everything was great! My only qualms were I wish the crunchy chicken had more of the ""crunch"" (its nuts basically on the bun but not very much of it) and the potato chips needed salt. "
,,,,,We definitely enjoyed it otherwise and would be back!
,,,,,"Very glad that you found us while you were out and about! I am a also a fan of the nut crumble and since we make each item to order we can certainly add some extra “crunchy”for your next visit; nut mix, chips or both. Thank you for the support"

,,,,,My absolute favorite lunch spot! The crunchy chicken sandwhich is a staple in my lunch rotations! It's perfectly warm/crunchy/fresh and all around delicious!! I always pair it with a cup of soup instead of the two sides! The soups are so fresh! 
,,,,,The kids grilled cheese and giant strawberries are my sons favorite! We get these every week!
,,,,,1st timer at Local Foods Fresh Delicious & Large portions. Looking forward to coming back.
,,,,,We are glad you found us and enjoyed our Blood Orange Mintade (a staff fav) and more! Thank you and we’ll see you soon
,,,,,"It was okay. The best Local Foods is the one on Kirby. Cashew queso was alright considering it's not made of real cheese. Wouldn't buy that again though - had a werid grainy consistency and random ""wateryness"" from the beans and tomatoes added. I was recommended to get the Fall Harvest Salad - it wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great. Their best salad is the Asian Chicken. There was too much going on with the random fruits - beets, grapefruit, some sort of squash???, and chicken. Not a good mix. My boyfriend said it tasted like cat food, but after paying 18$ for a salad I had to eat it. His burger was decent. Fries big wimpy. Carrot cake was not worth the money. Not sweet enough cake, needed the icing to balance. A good carrot cake doesn't need icing. I asked if they had the same lemonade as the one on Kirby and was met with hostility. Rather disappointed. I will continue to go to Kirby and not the Rice Village location."
,,,,,"Cat food, ouch! We're sorry to hear about your subpar experience with us, and do appreciate the feedback. The harvest salad changes seasonally depending on what's fresh at the time, maybe our upcoming spring version will be more to your liking, but we hope you have you back again before then!"
,,,,,"Local Foods will always have a spot in our hearts! We've been coming here since our pharmacy school days and have since moved to Dallas, but we always make it a priority to stop in for a quick lunch anytime we're back in Houston! Some notable favorite of ours include the Banh Mi, Truffled Egg Salad, and Smoked Salmon sandwiches! Also love the variety of sides you can choose from and always leave here with the biggest smiles on our faces! Can't wait till we're back again!"
,,,,,Thank you so much for your kind words! We hope you make your way back in to visit us soon!
,,,,,"The BLT...just WOW. The restaurant is always clean, and the vibe is happy brunch calm! Love this place"
,,,,,"Thank you, Alyssa! We love having you!"
,,,,,The patio is nice with plenty of seating and larger indoor venue then before. The food is good but your paying more for the location and the ambiance then the taste of the food. Had the avocado toast which sounded good but was more like a pile of salty guacamole on toast. Would not recommend. Have had the sandwiches and I would stick with them if I was to return.
,,,,,Local Foods has great food and a great atmosphere. The cashiers and servers are always very kind and help you decide when you can't. Great options for vegetarians. I always crave their egg salad sandwich. Always fresh and delicious. Good cocktails too!
,,,,,i honestly wasn't expecting that much but WOW the bahn mi was the best sandwich i've had this year in houston. the pork was so juicy and flavorful!!! highly recommend
,,,,,Thanks for coming by and for your praise! Check out weekend Brunch 10:00-3:00 Saturday and Sunday
,,,,,I cannot get enough of this place. I would have never thought to put the ingredients that they have together. All of the flavors really stand out on their own but also come together as well. The crunchy chicken sandwich and the garden sammie are my absolute favorites. Also the sandwiches are massive! They are so hefty. Everything is so fresh. Must try restaurant!
,,,,,"Perfect lunch place with excellent sandwiches and salads. Freshly prepared, very generous portions you can share if you are watching your weight."
,,,,,"The side dishes we had were kale and raisins and nuts, shredded beets, broccoli and quinoa; all seasoned differently. They make their own potato chips too."
,,,,,"Definitely order the Chrispy chicken sandwich on a pretzel roll,it's fresh chicken , not fried."
,,,,,2424 Dunstan Rd

,,,,,I found a hair in my kale salad and they charge 5% for to gos...
,,,,,I don't know if it's worth $17. I won't be returning.
,,,,,"Thank you for taking the time to leave this feedback. We sincerely apologize for our lapse in quality control and are currently emphasizing the importance of keeping vigilant to avoid embarrassing situations such as this happening again.  We hope you'll give us a chance to provide a five star experience for you, and hope to serve you again soon."
,,,,,"I've had Local Foods 4-5 times since my previous review, and I still find myself fairly underwhelmed by the consistently over-priced fare. The House Cured & Smoked Salmon was rather disappointing, as the predominant flavors are the onion jam and lemon cream cheese, which totally outshine the scant amount of sliced fish pressed between the toasted bagel halves. My favorite item remains the Gulf Seafood Sandwich. Between the crusty and spongy bread, cold but juicy shrimp, greed goddess dressing, pickled onions, and tomato, the sandwich tastes wonderfully complex and they are generous with the filling. The Posole Soup side is tangy and well-seasoned with shredded chicken and chewy hominy. It's healthy and easy, and we often end up ordering take-out from Local Foods at work when we want something fresh without too much discussion, but I very rarely find myself excited or fully satisfied by the meal."
,,,,,"I'm sorry to hear that we've continued to fall short of your expectations, and we appreciate you taking the time to leave feedback. We have since changed the setup for our smoked salmon sandwich from the bagel to pumpernickel which overall improves the salmon to bread ratio! Here's to hoping you'll give us another shot to provide a five star experience!"
,,,,,"Local Foods caters to the more health-conscious restaurant-goer, with a collection of fresh salads, sandwiches, soups, and such. A lot of my friends swear by this place, so my expectations were high, even as someone who who rarely consumes vegetables unless they are on, under, or around some type of meat. The interior is modern, well-lit, and diner-like, and there's a patio so you can eat outdoors. "
,,,,,"Across two visits, I've been fairly uninspired by my selections. The first time, I ordered the Gulf Shrimp & Blue Crab sandwich, which had a nice texture between the flaky bread and spongy filling, but would have benefited from being served room temperature rather than chilled. The House Smoked Salmon sandwich, on the other hand, was tasty but I prefer mine with a heavier dollop of cream cheese and more astringent onion flavor. To each his own though. The $-per-inch ratio was high for the sandwiches as well, which is to say they were both pretty tiny considering the price. "
,,,,,"What really knocks this cafe down a notch or two are its sides. They all sound wonderful and complex, but ultimately tasted relatively plain to me. I won't be ordering the quinoa, kale, beets, and acorn squash again."
,,,,,"The fact that Local Foods has such an impressive rating despite over 1,000 reviews suggests that my opinion is a pretty significant outlier. Perhaps my preferences just don't align with LF's culinary style...I definitely plan on returning and giving the food another chance while I'm still in town."
,,,,,"Local Foods is basically an upgraded slightly nicer version of a deli. The menu is generally pretty simple and full of dishes you could probably recreate at home with some effort, but all the food I've had here has been done well. I like that they try to make seasonal items. The portions here are big enough to make you satisfied but not feel overstuffed. I'm a fan of the garden sammie with its delicious caramelized Brussel sprouts, hummus, avocado, and fun assortment of veggies as well as the crunchy chicken! Fun fact: All of the sandwiches can be prepared as a salad (you just won't have the bun) at no extra charge."
,,,,,"The ambiance is very relaxed. It's a good place for a low-key friend or family meal, catch up, or date. The parking lot can get packed when they're busy, but you can usually find street parking nearby."
,,,,,"This is a total knock-it-out-of-the-park home run!!! The food was beyond delicious, it was beyond tasty and beyond full of flavor! We tried the pastrami sandwich, and the smoked chicken bowl, and wholly cow!!! It was a silent movie... We didn't talk because we couldn't stop eating!! It was insane, as each bite was better than the last!!"
,,,,,"The salads rocked, the sandwich was exceptional, and I walked away full and not over stuffed!!!"
,,,,,I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu!!! 
,,,,,P.S. I know it's not the most descriptive review... BUT SERIOUSLY!!! JUST GO TRY IT!!!
,,,,,I just had corn ribs from Local and they were so good I text my friend and then came to Yelp to yell it from the rooftop!! 
,,,,,No pics because I ate them alllllll
,,,,,Bring them to your Friendsgiving and gain more friends!
,,,,,"Local is a solid choice; we order @ work pretty frequently.  Fav is the garden sammie, sub for a pretzel bun.  Sometimes I'll have it as a salad which is equally as satisfying.  Vegan carrot cake cupcake is so good- get it."
,,,,,Came across this lovely gem while looking for a quick bite to eat. The food is great the staff is very friendly and it I would recommend this for a casual but fun lunch.
,,,,,"Alexis, thank you so much for your positive feedback!"
,,,,,"I haven't been to this location in years and didn't have a good experience the first time, but there has been a major improvement!"
,,,,,I think they remodeled since opening all those years ago and now there's a market that is connected to the restaurant and it's super cute. Lots of outside patio seating and cute booths to sit in inside.
,,,,,Each local foods has a slightly different menu with certain items that are specific to their location.
,,,,,"My go-to food items are the vegan cashew queso, truffled egg sandwich, and the crunchy chicken sandwich. This time, we tried the banh mi sandwich and the gulf shrimp and crab sandwich and those were pretty good too. All sandwiches can be made into salads! "
,,,,,The food quality has majorly improved and there's actually enough parking now!
,,,,,"The strawberry lemonade, hibiscus tea, and iced coffee with oatmilk are all delicious. There are a variety of desserts which can vary and some are gluten free, vegan, etc."
,,,,,There are daily specials listed on the menu when you walk in and at the ordering counter.
,,,,,I would come back if I'm ever in the area and hangry!
,,,,,I returned and got the crispy chicken sandwich this time and really enjoyed it!! The portion was huge and I couldn't finish it. I definitely want to return and try their salads.
,,,,,"I was expecting a lot from this place given the rave reviews from my friends. I got the Bacon Steak and Egg sandwich. It was pretty good- the egg was done well, the steak was flavorful, the bread (like a baguette) was perfectly crispy. I thought that this sandwich portion was much smaller than other sandwiches despite the already high price tag ($14 pre tax) so it was not filling at all!! The sides (beet salad and quinoa) were honestly not great at all but I forced them down. The quinoa was weirdly cold. Good restaurants usually can make healthy food taste good but this was not the case. "
,,,,,The ambience of the restaurant was nice and the service was very prompt and courteous! 
,,,,,"Overall, while the sandwich tasted good (not amazing), it was not worth the money and definitely not the sides! But if I were to come back, I would try the Crunchy Chicken Sandwich since everyone seems to rave about it!"
,,,,,I tried giving this location another chance. I used to loveeeee coming here a couple years ago it was my absolute fave. Everything is always so fresh and tasty. HOWEVER I have noticed since they have expanded to Austin the local foods locations quality has gone down hill. 
,,,,,"So the past time I was here me and my son went to bathroom while we were waiting for our food and they picked up the number and they thought we left which sucked. Why would we leave before getting our food? Also this last time the food was OKAY. I ordered the chicken posole which I always order at every location and is usually so fresh. This time it was horrible. It was mushy, lukewarm, and just not fresh. Idk if it's because I am cooking more now at home and I am used to super fresh yummy food but this place just doesn't do it for me anymore. Will not be coming back here anymore"
,,,,,"Homegrown casual eatery serving local sourced food. We went with baked Gulf oysters for appetizer. It tasted really good, but the 3 oysters were kind of small for $9. For the main action, we went with healthy tofu veggie bowl and crunchy chicken sandwich. I also asked for beet salad and homemade potato chip with the sandwich. The tofu  veggie bowl was big and fresh. The sandwich and beet were excellent. However the potato chips were too greasy for me. Service was good and there were plenty parking. Pricing was appropriate. We will return."

,,,,,"We really enjoyed the atmosphere, service, and of course the food. Almost all the tables have a plexiglass divider which made us feel very safe while being there."
,,,,,I love living next to a brunch place. I wish the menu was a little bit more adventurous and inclusive. I have not seen much change in the items since I've moved next to it. Could use a little more love when plating and with portion sizes. Maybe offer options to create your own morning combo? Sweet and salty...
,,,,,"Hi Rachel C.,"
,,,,,"We’re sorry to hear you didn’t love your food. We’d like to hear a little bit more about what happened, if you’d be willing to share it. Would you mind sending us an email to "
,,,,," with ""1/3 Yelp Montrose"" as the subject? We hope to hear from you!"
,,,,,"I love breakfast food so this was a great selection for me! It's a really nice place with great decor! I started off with the dirty drunken chai and that was delicious! Made my own omelet with pulled pork and spinach. Then finished off with the pancake of the day whihc was stuffed pineapples with coconut and brown sugar and sweet cream, I opted for strawberries instead of the pineapples and they were great! This came with some grits instead of toast, because why not? These grits at the look of it wasn't inviting but the taste was to die for! I finished it!!! "
,,,,,Theres ample parking both on the street and lot. The place fills up quickly but theres also outside sitting available.  The servers were very patient and nice. They are very accommodating. I would recommend this to anyone
,,,,,"This place was PACKED! It's basically in the heart of Montrose, so you guessed it.. NO PARKING! "
,,,,,"We were having a bridal brunch so it was 8 of us.. you can't make a res so it's first come first serve. We planned to arrive at 11, but some of the ladies arrived at 10:15 to wait for a table."
,,,,,"I am always late, so I didn't arrive until 11:30 and guess what, my entire party was still outside waiting on a table. We didn't get seated until 12pm. That's a little ridiculous. It's hotter than jalepenos outside and they have you waiting, no water, no misty fans, nothing."
,,,,,"The food definitely made up for the extreme wait. Massive burritos, hasbrowns, tacos, shrimp and grits all filled our tables -- not one complaint. "
,,,,,"Service was a little slow, but I get it.. it's brunch and we all get weeded."
,,,,,"Everyone else ordered flavored mimosas and enjoyed them, but lil ol' me just had to get tequila. I got the watermelon jalapeño rita and it was less than pleasant. I didn't even drink it, and don't waste alcohol. So needless to say, that was a waste. "
,,,,,"I do like the checkout system, the server brought out 2 electronic pads for us to pay and that was probably the most exciting part of the visit. YIKES!"
,,,,,This place is popular for good reason! This location isn't too large so depending on the time you come expect a longgg wait (up to 1 hr). No reservations 
,,,,,"The food is worth it! I usually split a sweet item and a savory item. I have loved all of their sweet items including the OMG french toast, pineapple pancake, and the sweet potato pancakes. For savory I go for the breakfast burrito but replace the eggs to make it vegan. The hashbrowns inside the burrito is a nice touch. Incredibly filling burrito. Huge portion size. "
,,,,,The parking here is horrible. Only about 8 spots total in the lot. Lots of street parking nearby though. 
,,,,,"The service here is very hit or miss. We've had a fantastic waiter here who went above and beyond. We've also had one of the worst waiters I've had of any service experience this location. He spilled coffee creamer on our table and didn't clean it up, forgot to bring out the sauce that typically comes with our meals, and didn't bring us utensils. "
,,,,,Still would definitely return for the food.
,,,,,"Whew y'all it should be a sin how good their breakfast is!! My mom, friend and I were literally in a food coma because we could not stop eating. The Spuds Deluxe and Funky Monkey French Toast are MUSTS!! You can do half order or the french toast in case you want to try both! Super flavorful and fresh! Drink of choice -- Mountain Mule with Vodka. I don't like grapefruit juice but it's amazing in the mule. They play great music as well and the staff always seem friendly and happy to serve each customer. Highly recommend!"
,,,,,"This place is delicious!!great atmosphere! Great service! The nitro cold brew coffee is a. Must try! Their pancakes and French toast are light, sweet, and delightful. Shrimp grits is full"
,,,,,"Of bold flavor. I wish they used fresh shrimp, but still a tasty brunch option! And a definitive must have when you're here is the pineapple upside down pancake. It's... it's... it's everything in flavor explosion in your mouth that you'd ever want!! Just try it!"
,,,,,"Had the hash and avocado benedict. Both were cold. I think the avocado and cold tomatoe on the benedict just makes the whole ensemble cold. Better if they grilled it. As far as hash not sure why it was cold. Service was horrible. No ""can I get you sugar for you coffee, salt and pepper or anything else"". No two minute rule ""how is everything"". Just dropped the food off and then dropped the check off. And when we told the waitress about our food being cold, no apology, no making it right, nothing. That's why you got a 1% tip. It's not hard to be a thoughtful waitress, but evidently some people are just not cut out for it. Won't be back."
,,,,,"Hi Baltazaar L.,"

,,,,,"Best brunch in Houston! I'm so glad Snooze has opened up shop in Houston. They deserve the hype. Finding a parking place and waiting for a table are of course a hassle, but it's totally worth it. Most recently I went on a Monday at 10am and there happened to be no wait, but this is quite rare for them!"
,,,,,"I really love the ""light as a feather"" portion of their menu as it highlights healthy breakfast and brunch items. And these healthy items are still so innovative and delicious! My favorite dish is the Spring Has Sprung egg white frittata. It's so good that you don't even need to add avocado! "
,,,,,"I also love that Snooze is setting an example in Houston as an environmentally engaged restaurant. Really impressed that they compost, use low energy appliances, and don't pass out plastic containers. Hope other restaurants in town will follow their lead!"
,,,,,"Good brunch spot, was wanting chicken and waffles but they didn't have it. However the monkey French toast was a good substitute!"

,,,,,Loved this place went here with a group of friends really nice scenery from the out to the inside! Outside while waiting they have a cornhole board to get a little game of cornhole in they also have outdoor seating if you want to sit outside and eat. The inside is really spacious with a lot of seating available to be able to get a good breakfast. Really liked how clean it was inside it was very well taken care and the food itself was awesome! Our service was great also walked in with about five other people our server was very prompt and welcoming since we were in town visiting. Certainly a place I will come back try if I get the chance to visit again.
,,,,,I would go here a lot before COVID. It's good to hear that they are still open! This is one of my favorite brunch places in Houston. The pineapple upside pancakes are my go-to but honestly everything at Snooze is amazing.
,,,,,A wonderful place for breakfast with a friendly staff. I had the breakfast pot pie.  Flaky puff pastry with an awesome country gravy. Also came with house made hash browns.  Soo good. Sister in law had the shrimp & grits. Sausage had some bite but all and all good. The grits was very tasty and made me forget I don't like grits. The omg French toast was done well. And the pancake flight was all good. My favorite from the trio was the pineapple upside down pancake.  
,,,,,Highly recommend. Only downside parking kinda sucks. One small lot and street parking
,,,,,"This place was AWESOME!!!! They had so many menu selections and it was hard to choose. From the French toast, to the bacon and sausage. They must use organic eggs as two eggs did not yield as much on my plate (I wish I had more!!!!) and was a little sad. Overall..... I WILL DEFINITELY return and can't wait to get home to see how the ATL location tastes!!!!!"
,,,,,The food was great. Social distancing setup was good at this location but the table setup for a party larger than 3 was tough on the round booth. Make sure you get the cinnamon roll pancakes!
,,,,,Came to Snooze after a real good church service around 10:45. The wait for 2 was 25-40 minutes so we walked around for about 30 min til we were called. Parking is pretty bad so be prepared for that or uber. 
,,,,,I ordered the Abri-Ca-Lac-Ra mimosa and my boyfriend had the Mmm Mmm mimosa. They were so good! I wish they sold by the caraft! My boyfriend decided on the pineapple upside down pancake. I of course couldn't decide between the shrimp and grits and the OMG French Toast so the waiter suggested I get a half of each. 
,,,,,The shrimp and grits had a great flavor. They used ground sausage which was something new but it was really good. I def would try again. The French toast was very rich! Definitely glad I got a half plate. The pineapple upside down cake was amazing but we definitely recommend getting a half plate unless you're sharing! 
,,,,,Overall we had a great experience and will definitely be back!
,,,,,"This is probably one of the best brunch spots I have ever been to. We joined the waitlist via Yelp and only ended up having to wait about 10 minutes before we were seated at the restaurant. Our server was very friendly and made the experience better. All of the food we tried was amazing! We ordered the sweet potato veggie smash up, snooze classic with a sweet potato pancake, and protein and veggie egg white scramble. The food came out quickly and was very fresh. The highlight was definitely the sweet potato pancake which was probably the best pancake I have had in my life! This place is worth stopping at and we will definitely be back soon!"
,,,,,"The food is consistently good at every Snooze, but the wait is consistently long and the parking is severely limited at this location. There are no reservations, which is understandable but I really don't like their policy to only seat a party once every single person has arrived. It makes for a crowded inside and patio."
,,,,,I've tried something from every section of the menu but I really like to order their versions of eggs Benedict. My favorite has to be the Chile Verde Benny with barbacoa beef. I've had the cinnamon roll pancake (it's on the a la Carte portion of the menu) and it's good but a sugary overload. The hot chocolate is also delicious.
,,,,,The food is good but be prepared to carve out a 3 hour block for brunch.
,,,,,The OMG French toast and the flight of pancakes all flavors are so amazing. My husband got the omelette with chorizo sausage and ham and cheese and that was amazing! Expect a long wait or put your name on the waitlist before you get there.
,,,,,Thank you for sharing! We always love when folks have a good time at Snooze. We hope to sweep you off your feet again soon!
,,,,,"This place is like a busy train station, constantly moving, get here early and possibly prepare to wait but it's worth the wait. We were able to get seated quicker once two spots opened up at the bar. "
,,,,,They have a really good breakfast/brunch menu. 
,,,,,I opted for the flight stack so I could taste a few different pancakes. The pineapple upside down pancake was really my favorite. 
,,,,,The puff pastry for my chicken pot pie was pretty good and so was the pot pie. 
,,,,,"My sisters meal was like a egg scramble but was overwhelming to eat, she couldn't finish it. "
,,,,,Great breakfast spot to gather with friends

,,,,,Love this place!! Great environment and everyone is extremely nice and fun. The dishes are beautiful and super fun to eat and enjoy. The wait is long but it is so worth it!!!
,,,,,One of my favorite breakfast places food is always fresh and tasty. You may choose to drink healthy or have the tradition breakfast fare or spiked. The service is always friendly and prompt. The outdoor seating is a nice option when you want to have more conversation less music. Also nice when it cools down. Like the fact that almost any dish can be vegetarian. Kids is good too as one is usually limited to one type of pancake etc not here. Overall a really nice vibe and place to brunch considering it's a chain it still hasn't lost its unique appeal
,,,,,My 3rd time here the service is great food served hot and always tasty have a great variety and vegan options as well as both alcoholic and non alcohol drinks which is always nice option.  Definitely a great option for breakfast.
,,,,,"Put myself on the waitlist from the hotel and the wait list was at 6 to 21 minutes then showed up and was told it would be another 20 minutes. Staff were rude and will definitely never return to this business. tried Harry's in town and it was a much better customer service experience. better seating, better customer service, better food, and just a better overall suggestion. Definitely try Harry's over this place would be my suggestion."
,,,,,"Hi Shelly,"
,,,,,We're sorry to hear you were frustrated by our seating system the last time you were in. We'd like to explain and get a little more information from you. Would you mind emailing us at 
,,,,," with ""Montrose 4/3"" as the subject? We hope to hear from you."
,,,,,"Let me start by saying this is my first ever review. I am a new resident to TX, I have dined at other Snooze locations and loved it, sometimes a lengthy wait, but never the less over all experience pretty good. A family member and I go today to the Montrose location and had the worst experience. I arrived at 9:20 am and was told the wait was about 25 minutes, I informed the hostess that I had to be to IAH by 12 she explained that we  would be serviced and out in enough time. After waiting 30 minutes we were seated , the server whose name was Peter comes over he takes our drink order and brings us water, my niece who was visiting asked for an orange juice 20 minutes later still no orange juice. We were ready to order once he comes back to get the food order I ask him a couple of questions. "
,,,,," : Do they carry the steak egg Benedict ? He informed me that due to Covid-19 there was a limited menu, fine no big deal right, so my next order is a mimosa. Peter tells me that the mimosa can't be ordered for another 5 minutes because they don't start serving liquor until 10am, once again I say that's fine, (still no orange juice btw) "
,,,,,"So Peter checks in on us I remind him of the OJ he goes back to get it, my mimosa comes out... at this point it is 10:15 AM  we have been waiting since 9:20 to sit and eat. 10:45 AM is upon my party and I, so I stop a worker walking past and inform her they could cancel the order because it doesn't seem like it was put in, Peter brings us the bill and the mimosa and orange juice is on there...."
,,,,,"Let me say this COVID-19 took a nice chunk out of people in the serving industries pockets, but now that things are slowly opening back up, the customer service is despicable and almost like the patrons owe the restaurant and the staff their money. "
,,,,,"Let's do better, I'm sure staffing is down because the capacity amount is down 50% , I get it but at a certain point I feel service should be declined in the most professional way possible , when wait times are at an hour or 2 for food, that should be voiced honestly so consumers can make a conscious decision to wait that long."
,,,,,"Hi Jay,"
,,,,,Yikes! This doesn't sound like a great Snooze experience at all. We'd like to hear more and make it right. Would you mind emailing us at 
,,,,," with ""Montrose, 6/7, Yelp"" as the subject? We hope to hear from you."
,,,,,Their seasoning is on point shrimp n grits are awesome their Benedict's are good. Holandaze  sauce really good yummy yummy in my tummy the staff is attentive and friendly !!!
,,,,,Over priced
,,,,,Over sugared
,,,,,Long queues
,,,,,Worth it if you want to enjoy your instagram post of your food more than the actual taste of your food
,,,,,"Food was excellent! We ordered the OMG French toast and the  ""create your own"" eggs. (I got a spinach, goat cheese & sausage egg scramble) It was amazing! The only thing that put a damper on our visit was the manager on duty (I believe that her name was Maria) She was yelling at our server to move ""faster"" in front of our table and a few other customers. Our server was actually delightful and helping us to make informed choices. It was a very inappropriate display of management and definitely showed a lack of quality leadership on her part. "
,,,,,Side note:
,,,,,Parking should to be extended into the parking lot next door. It's very cramped parking for such a yummy & busy spot.
,,,,,Came in on a Tuesday and had no problems getting a table within 5-10 minutes before we went to the zoo. We sat in a giant booth and I honestly had to lean forward to eat but that Bravocado toast was worth it. Our waitress was super friendly and always made sure we had everything we needed. She didn't even complain when the baby we had with us made a huge watery mess. 
,,,,,The bravocado toast was AMAZING. The rustic bread and red onion jam was such a great combination. It almost tasted Italian but had fried eggs on top which made it breakfasty. The bread was drizzled with oil but was still crispy. It came with a nice arugula salad with fresh Parmesan cheese on top and a glass of fresh orange juice. I wish i could have eaten every single bite but I was full after one egg/toast. 
,,,,,Parking was kind of a hassle but we were lucky enough to find a spot up front and they had benches for sitting and waiting (including some outdoor eating areas). I can't wait to come back and taste the sweet potato hash or one of their infamous pastries.
,,,,,"Janelle is the bomb! The food is the bomb! The service is the Bomb! Literally it all started janelle and then moved into delicious food and drinks! Really appreciated our service, she is a superstar!"
,,,,,I really enjoy going to get breakfast at Snooze. I usually go to the location in the woodlands since it is closer to where I live. But a couple of my friends and I went to this location in Montrose and really enjoyed ourselves. We used the wait list through yelp so by the time we got there our table was ready. I ordered the snooze classic and substituted my toast for the sweet potato pancake (best decision ever btw). Great customer service as well!

,,,,,"Here's a 5 star review!!!  From the time I entered and i was greeted by 2 nice, professional gentlemen.  One of them took me to my seat with guest.  The server, a female, greeted us promptly, took drink order.  She came back in less than a minute.  She took food order; cane back a few times to refill drinks, bring condiments, let us know food is on the way.  I ordered the shrimp & grits which was heavenly.  Not too much, not too little.  My guest ordered the 3 egg omelette with hash browns and tortillas which he said was great.   The staff seemed to work well with each other.  Parking available.  Clean spot.  Definitely recommend."
,,,,,Came by last week for the first time during the week. It was pretty good. Their mimosas were good except the grapefruit. Don't get that one because it's not sweet whatsoever. You get the bitter taste of the grapefruit. We tried their funky monkey French toast which was amazing. A bit on the sweeter side but 
,,,,,. Also tried their huevos tostadas. It was okay. The salsa added had a lot of cumin in it. A bit overpowering. And Oh my god their sausage patties are delicious. Especially the chorizo sausage patty! That was the highlight. They also have a full open bar all week. I will be back.
,,,,,This is so wonderful to hear! Thank you for letting us know that you love Snooze. We love you back and hope to see you again soon!
,,,,,"Very busy on Sunday mornings so the wait was about 20 min even around 930, but food was great. 10/10. Will for sure be back."

,,,,,Hope to see you for brunch again sometime soon!
,,,,,"If you want the best breakfast ever go to Snooze. It gets crowded quickly though. That's because it has the best food. Their gluten free blueberry pancakes are to die for. They taste like the real thing. I also like their Juan's Breakfast Tacos and their Chile Verde Benedict. If you have a wheat allergy like I do. Which I hate BTW. You just let them know and they can switch up items for you. For example, the benedict will come on a corn style muffin and the tacos will have corn tortillas. Their hot chocolate is amazing and I also love their mimosas."
,,,,,"Waited almost 40 minutes for food. Tables seated after ours received their food quickly. We had to flag down another server to go get ours to check on our food - he came & said he would check on it and never came back! Food came out cold about 10 minutes later. Needless to say, service was extremely slow & we were dissatisfied with the food. We will not visit this location again."
,,,,,"Hi J P,"
,,,,,"We’re sorry to hear service has been less than amazing. We’d like to get a little more information from you, if you’d be willing to share it. Would you mind emailing us at "
,,,,," with “Montrose 9/24” as the subject?  if you can, please attach a copy of the check or let us know the check number. We hope to hear from you!"
,,,,,It's definitely the BEST place to have a good breakfast
,,,,,The pancakes here are AWESOME!! 
,,,,,The service is quick and place is always full 
,,,,,"Our server was super nice, And food was delicious"
,,,,,"In the time of COVID-19 and my remote working ass's need to see, even from a distance, other humans; it was awesome that Snooze was open.   They are overly conscious of our safety and the entire staff were masked. (I realize this sounds like a ""duh"", but I have witnessed far too many food service employees becoming more lax on this basic standard of care as the capacities continue to increase).  The menu is accessed via a QR code on the table and check out is done with a mobile device instead of the staff having to handle customer credit cards.  Tables were responsibly distanced and when we arrived at 9:30am on a Sunday, we didn't have to wait for a table.  Our food arrived quickly and just in time as I was H.U.N.G.O.V.E.R.  My pancake flight with a side of bacon was just what the doctor ordered. I even ended up stealing the hashbrowns from Boyfriend's plate. "
,,,,,"If have the resources to support eateries at this time, then Snooze is a great pick.  Even if it is a chain, the staff here are not. And they are working hard and safely for their customers."
,,,,,My first visit here I had to order To go since the wait time was super long. 
,,,,,My second experience was better I came before 8:30 am and had less than a 10 minute wait. 
,,,,,"We had the pleasure of having Ms. Honeycutt was our server. Today's order consisted of the Breakfast Burrito, OMG FrenchToast, and a side of Scrambled eggs and sausage, all pictured below. "
,,,,,The music is at a fair noise level and they have switched to paper straws from plastic
,,,,,"Absolutely, hands down my favorite brunch place on the planet! If I lived in Houston I would probably be here every weekend. "
,,,,,"After my friend and I had had a wild night out the night before, I was ready for grease, eggs and maybe a little hair of the dog. My friend? Not so much. She wasn't doing so well, but we went anyway. "
,,,,,"Being an eggs benny gal, I didn't even bother to look at the rest of the menu. They have a nice selection of about 7-8 eggs bennys. An added bonus is that you can mix and match if you want or just order one. I like places with customized choices like that. I ordered the avocado smash(and it was, a smash I mean) and added bacon. It comes with hash browns served in a neat cylindrical shape that's just, well, neat! I also ordered the Boss hog bloody mary made with bacon infused whiskey. It was just the hair of the dog I needed topped with an elaborate coliflor, pickle, olive garnish with a huge piece of bacon bobbing out of it. I felt guilty for a moment as my friend headed to the bathroom holding her stomach, but still managed to wolf and slurp everything down. "
,,,,,"Luckily, the next day my friend was feeling like herself again and when she asked me where I wanted to go for brunch, I immediately said ""Snooze! I have to check out the rest of the menu!""  Off we went where I had an omelette and a cup of joe, like a proper person. "
,,,,,I'll be back for sure. I hear they have 4 other locations in the US.
,,,,,"Came in to enjoy the new happy hour I've been seeing a lot of online posts about (weekdays 2-4pm). It did not disappoint! With zero wait time we walked in to be welcomed with great service, deals, and food."

,,,,,Thank you for sharing! We always love when folks have a good time at Snooze. We hope to sweep you off your feet again soon!
,,,,,"I give the food an A+, but the service only a C+. My husband ordered the breakfast sandwich, with egg and sausage. I ordered the ginger pancakes. Both meals were very good, and the portions are huge. However the service was lacking. At one point I went to the bathroom and saw our waiter looking at his paycheck with another employee, and talking about their hours/pay. However our waters and my coffee had been empty for quite a while. We finally just grabbed another waiter to help us. I would visit again, as some other servers seemed more on top of things at their tables, and the food was amazing!"
,,,,,Picture a fancy dennys same low quality food.
,,,,,Only good thing was the waitress super nice and attentive.

,,,,,"I AM SO GLAD SNOOZE HAS DECIDED TO BRANCH OUT FROM AUSTIN TO HOUSTON TO THE OUTSKIRTS OF HOUSTON. The wait time for this location can get crazy, especially for brunch on the weekend! I LOVE that Snooze offers flights for their benedicts and pancakes."
,,,,,My favorite:
,,,,,Benedict: Chile Verde Benny (the Ham Benedict III was too dry for my liking)
,,,,,"Pancakes: Blueberry Danish, Pineapple Upside Down"
,,,,,"Food and service here was great! I placed myself on the waitlist through the yelp app and it did a good job at securing us a table. I ordered the breakfast burrito & my boyfriend ordered the shrimp & grits, everything tasted amazing. We will be coming back"
,,,,,next time we're in Houston!
,,,,,Thank you for sharing! We always love when folks have a good time at Snooze. We hope to sweep you off your feet again soon!
,,,,,"Very dissapointed as I expected another over hyped breakfast spot. The one thing that saved our meal was the regular buttermilk pancakes. We got the regular breakfast plate that came with eggs, hashbrowns, and sausage. We had the pancake flight and omg french toast. Hash browns were untouched after our first bite. It tasted extremely over seasoned. Eggs were under average. Sausage was ok. Flight of pancakes cane with a sweet potato, blueberry, and pineapple one. Sweet potato was and blueberry were alright but would not reorder those. The pineapple was better tasting, but nothing to rave about. Omg french toasts was good. But in the end i'd say only the buttermilk pancakes were worth getting and MAYBE the french toast. Service takes a long time so be prepared for the wait..."
,,,,,"This is the best snooze. Period. I was eating at the Galleria Snooze and it was fine, but I found myself missing the excellent service that Gabe and Marina give me whenever I pop in, hungover and regretting the previous night."
,,,,,"I just had my first snooze experience and Gabriel the bartender made it a special one indeed. I think this is my new spot. Try the AM Manhattan, that's the best cup I've had"
,,,,,"Initially I thought I'd give this place a 4-star review solely based on their VERY limited parking lot, but the food definitely made up for it! "
,,,,,"On the inside, this place has such a fun energy of people who love to work here, and it shows! Although it was already around 12:30 pm, the place was still crowded but no lines luckily. "
,,,,,"We got the sweet potato hash and the pancake flight. The hash was topped with 2 perfectly cooked sunny-side up eggs and the flight includes 3 of your choice of their fairly large and flavorful pancakes (we chose the pumpkin spice, sweet potato, and their daily pancake - chocolate and pretzels)! Their coffee is pretty on point as well!"
,,,,,Can't wait for y'all to open up in Webster!
,,,,,Food was good and mimosas were strong (just right). My only complaint is the music is blaring and when you going to be with friends you end up yelling across the table.
,,,,,"Hey there Louie, thanks for sharing that you love Snooze! We love you back and want your next visit to be perfect. Please know that if you are ever uncomfortable with the volume of the music, we are more than happy to turn it down upon request! We'll see you soon; happy brunching!"
,,,,,"While it's a bit overpriced for what you are getting, the food is so tasty. "
,,,,,"We came on a weekday around lunchtime and there wasn't a wait. The service was great, while the food did take awhile to be prepared. They were prepared for us to split our foods, and the way they allow you to pay is genius. "
,,,,,"We got the pancake flight and tried the pancake of the day (white chocolate chip pancake), chocolate chip, pineapple, sweet potato, peanut butter, and blueberry. My least favorite were sweet potato and pineapple but the pineapple was probably because I saved it for the end and was so full. These are very sweet, so treat them as desserts! My favorite was peanut butter, chocolate chip, and pancake of the day. Honestly, all the pancakes were great, even the ones that were my least favorite!!"
,,,,,"I also split the Chile verde eggs Benedict with a friend and it was DELICIOUS! My portion was quite substantial- I think when they divide it into two, they double the Pico de Gallo and hash brown you get so both of the portions get enough to eat which is amazing. I definitely recommend this. My friend got the taco and the portion was generous also. "
,,,,,"Edit: I returned on a Saturday and got pancake flights, this time trying the cannoli and French toast. I didn't particularly like these. I also got a half portion of the Snooze Spuds deluxe and while it was tasty, I recommend the Chile Verde eggs Benedict as it has more for the same price. "
,,,,,"Overall, I definitely recommend this place during the weekday for brunch and am looking forward to coming back."

,,,,,"All my life, I've heard about Snooze. I think it is one of the most popular places for brunch in Houston. We got the sweet potato hash and the Sandwich I Am. The breakfast sandwich was good; the pretzel bun was one of the best part about that sandwich. To be honest, we've had better breakfast sandwiches, but I did hold a higher expectation for the food due to the glowing reviews on Yelp and through word of mouth. "
,,,,,"When we went back for a friend's birthday, we weren't like ""Oh, this is something I have to order again."" I actually had a piece of a friend's pancake the second time around, and I thought it was pretty good. Light and fluffy, as all pancakes should be. However, with my sweet potato hash. the eggs were slightly cold, but well-seasoned. Cheese on sweet potatoes is an innovation that you would never have previously imagined; it was... interesting. Atmosphere was vibrant and buzzing. The wait is horrendous; the parking is atrocious. I suggest you get there early, or have a sacrificial friend wait ahead of time there. We had time to head to the Walgreens across the street to purchase snacks while waiting. "
,,,,,"Overall, the food is good overall, but not worth the hype nor the wait. 3.5/5 stars."
,,,,,FOOD
,,,,,"Before I dive into the details, I have to say that while the food was delicious, I do think it is a bit overpriced. Now, on to the food. The habanero pork belly benny was great, however it was mostly sweet from the toppings so I think more salty flavor would've really balanced well. The smashed avocado benny was really great, the avocado well seasoned and the egg on top cooked perfectly (the pork belly's egg was overcooked). I love their hashbrowns! Topped with the Yellowbird hot sauce and wow, a perfect breakfast food. "
,,,,,DRINK
,,,,,"I got an orange juice to hydrate and refresh me after a workout and it was nice! Would not get it again because of the cost, unless I was really craving it. "
,,,,,ATMOSPHERE
,,,,,"I like Snooze's theme however usually, once you get your food, you're kind of unattended as there are so many people the waitstaff have to deal with. I do really appreciate their ""self-service"" style of billing, wish more restaurants would follow their lead! Overall, Snooze's atmosphere is the worst part about it (wait times, bit higher price for brunch food) but it makes up for it with the food!"
,,,,,"Before going to Houston I had this bookmarked as so many of my Yelp friends adored the place. OMG was this place terrific probably the best breakfast in the State of Texas if this was located in South Florida I would be a regular. Hint hint please open more locations. They originated in Colorado and are in Texas, California and Arizona. Nice free street parking out front. No wait as we came here on a Monday morning. The menu was terrific I love the calorie count next to each item. "
,,,,,I went healthy and had the Goldilocks steel cut oatmeal with hemp seed and other healthy goodies. Also the freshest fruit in the world banana slices and berries. Portion was too large to finish. The cappuccino hit the spot and another thing listed was all their local sourcing. 
,,,,, The motif was something out of the Jetson's great design and upbeat vibe. Will definitely return again and again on my next trip to Houston.
,,,,,"Was on the way to the restaurant and decided to check if they had an online waitlist. Thank God they did because we ""skipped"" the line and went straight to being seated. Use this feature! We got there and loved the vibe! I went during brunch with a friend and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The playlist was a hugggeeee factor in our dining experience. I ordered the avocado sweet potato hash. It tasted great. I wanted to try something different and that dish did the trick. We also ordered the flight (?) of pancakes. Our favorite was the pineapple upside down cake. It was greeeatttf. I will definitely be ordering that the next time I go. Overall great experience, I'm excited to go back!"
,,,,,"Great experience--no complaints. The parking lot was full, but we found a spot on Lovett. There were lots of people waiting outside, but we put our name in at the front desk and they gave us a 20-30 minute wait estimate and took our number so they could text us when our table was ready. Sat down within 20 minutes, and we had:"
,,,,,"- Nitro cold brew coffee (good, and only $1 more than their regular coffee)"
,,,,,- Bravocado toast (great)
,,,,,"- Benny Duo: smashed avocado benedict (good) and habanero pork belly benedict (great), hash browns (average)"
,,,,,"- Side of fruit (great, but too expensive for the size. We liked that there were berries and pineapple--no lame fruits)"
,,,,,"The food was great. The atmosphere was pleasant. The service left a lot to be desired. The server was prompt when taking our orders, and that's where it stopped, and everything went on pause for 10mins then 2 of 6 persons receive drinks. Pause 10mins then we had found someone for the other 4  to have their thirst quench. It wasn't the best of times."
,,,,,"If you're in town, Snooze is the breakfast/brunch place to be, I love this place! "
,,,,,"First, let's get the downsides out of the way: the wait for this place is famously long unless you go on a weekday and parking can be a hit or a miss. When I try to come on the weekends, it's usually around a 45 min - 1.5 hr wait, but you do have the option of getting an order to go. There are also some corn holes outside so you can kill time lol."
,,,,,"Otherwise, the food here is amazing! I highly recommend getting the flight of pancakes, and then I highly recommend the sweet potato pancake because it's so moist, fluffy, and then topped off with candied pecans and what's not to drool about over that. There's always also a pancake of the day flavor so be sure to try that. "
,,,,,"As for savory food, I've tried the Benny Goodman (basically a lox on bread, really good but also has a ton of cream cheese), the Sweet Brown Hash (lots of potatoes with gochujang on top, can't go wrong), and the Breakfast Pot Pie (great savory option)."
,,,,,"We came of a Wednesday morning so there was no line at all. There are so many options for breakfast but we got the snooze classic (made vegan), Benny duo and the pot pie. The eggs are perfectly runny. The snooze classic had potato hash, sour dough bread and jam, soyrizo and tofu scramble. The tofu scramble was seasoned very well and was flavorful. The soyrizo was quite good but I found that there was too much of it. I wish the bread was toasted a little more. Breakfast at snooze is an amazing value for the cost. I definitely recommend it! "
,,,,,My friends said the pot pie and eggs benny were really good.
,,,,,"HANDS DOWN my favorite brunch place in Houston! I come here often, and it never disappoints. "
,,,,,"Yes, the wait is no joke and parking sucks, but the food is well worth it."
,,,,,"I usually get the Pancake Flight, which is a great option that lets you try multiple flavors. The Pineapple Upside Down is an absolute dream. I crave it all the time. "
,,,,,"The Snooze Spuds Deluxe is an excellent savory option. Sounds simple, but so tasty! The waiter was kind enough to split this dish into two for my friend and me. "
,,,,,The eggs Benedicts are also a delicious option. 
,,,,,"If you haven't been here, you must try it asap!"
,,,,,"Breakfast was great ! My gf loved it as well. Definitely will come back here and shout out to our server Daniel, was prompt and quick. Made sure we were taken care of but wasn't annoying."

,,,,,"My friend and I came here for dine in for first time for her birthday and we had a great and safe time here! The tables were spaced out and all the waiters were wearing a mask. The service was quick and food were amazing! It is a great brunch restaurant and there is a patio area too so if people arent feeling safe to be inside to eat, they may eat outside. I got one of the benedict from the menu ( I dont remember the specific name) but it had the perfect combination of southern taste and the hash btown really hit the spot. If you are one of the person looking for something light, you may not like it but thos restaurant did had various of choices. And my friend got one of the cocktail and she said it was made well. The only thing is that the server never came around to refill my coffee and I wished that he had."
,,,,,Phenomenal!!!!!!!
,,,,,"I am from New York and this place was highly recommended. Although it was a long wait it was very much so worth the wait. The customer service was excellent the food was served in big portions. My only bad review is that they don't really monitor how long people stay at the tables for example there was a party of three sitting at a table playing chess for 3+ hours, I can tell because I know that they had brunch and when we finally got to sit after waiting one hour they were finishing their food and then started playing chess and we left before they left. "
,,,,,The pancakes were great the French toast was amazing all little food was well seasoned and very delicious
,,,,,"We went on a weekday morning, so it wasn't really busy (it does get really busy on the weekends, so make a reservation!) I got a chai and eggs benedict, and the eggs benedict tasted really good. The chai was especially good-they gave the option for a spicier chai or sweeter chai, and I went for the sweeter chai. My friend got the pineapple upside down pancake and not only is it unique, it tastes good too! The menu gives you a lot of options, and the atmosphere is friendly and light-definitely recommend for breakfast/brunch!"
,,,,,"Snooze is an unbelievably delicious breakfast spot. If you get in line online (using Yelp) before you arrive, you will be MUCH better off than just trying to walk up and get in line. There is always at least an hour wait on the weekends. You can see the wait time using Yelp! HIGHLY recommend this method. "
,,,,,"The food is delectable. I usually get the Eggs Benny Duo- the one with balsamic vinegar and the classic - and a pineapple upside down pancake. Does not sound too ""breakfast"" y... but, I assure you it's one of my favorite meals. "
,,,,,I love the atmosphere and old time diner feel of Snooze.   You can't go wrong eating here!
,,,,,The food was amazing and the wait was a bit but it was worth it.  Got the Benny duo where you can choose two different Benedict's to try. Tried the Bella Bella and the lox N latke both were amazing.

,,,,,"I feel like they have so much potential to be better. I've been to several locations, and consistency seems to be the missing key. Still a good spot for a quick bite, just don't be a Karen with high expectations."
,,,,,"It had been awhile since I'd eaten here and I was pleasantly welcomed back with a terrific experience. I was greeted by a friendly host and was even seated at the bar before my wait time. I received EXCEPTIONAL service from Gabe. He makes such friendly and fun conversation- all while multi-tasking numerous tasks behind the bar. He's very attentive and pays close attention to detail he made sure I got any substitutions I asked for. I've been back to visit several times already sense! If you haven't been, go get yourself a BLT-Riffic sandwich (add the egg- just do it) or a vegan bliss pancake . I can honestly say I've never had a bad meal or experience while dining with Snooze."

,,,,,"Amazing every time. The Benedicts are the best thing here, and if you can't decide, get the duo to try one of each. You won't regret it. "
,,,,,"I eat a lot in one sitting, so I always get an extra order of hash browns on the side since it does take a while for food to arrive after you order it."
,,,,,I'm so happy that I was able to make it to brunch here! I first heard about this place on a trip to Denver but didn't have the opportunity to stop by.
,,,,,They don't take reservations so be prepared to wait a while. The good thing is that they have free coffee! I am not a big coffee drinker but the coffee was so great that I drank it black.
,,,,,There was a 45 minute wait which was annoying but it was okay because they had a giant connect four game and we played a few games.
,,,,,Our server Erykah was really nice and sweet. She had a great personality! There were few hiccups with paying the check because of some new system that they had and my order had cheese on it when I asked for none.
,,,,,"Aside from that, the food was amazing! We ordered hash browns, the spuds, and shrimp and grits. Everything was super flavorful and delicious. There are so many great options and it was hard to choose!"
,,,,,Excellent breakfast.  I had the avocado toast with egg.  Outstanding!  A foodie paradise.
,,,,,"Wow! Thank you for your fantastic review, Helen! We are thrilled that you loved your experience at Snooze and look forward to seeing you again. Happy Brunching!"
,,,,,"WOW! One of the most amazing restaurant experiences we've ever had! Despite it being a holiday weekend, Snooze District Manager, Jason, was in the restaurant and personally taste testing in the kitchen. He found that the Sweet Potato Hash was not up to Snooze's very high standards (overly salty, he said), came to our table to warn us, to let us know that there was insufficient time to make more hash and to suggest that we find a substitute - which we did. The Corn Beef hash was excellent. "
,,,,,"     Also had their breakfast pot pie, found that the gravy was a bit skimpy, asked for more and they brought enough to float a battleship. However, our server had to be reminded of the gravy request so comped us a Blueberry Danish Pancake as an apology. DELICIOUS! "
,,,,,"     Finally, Snooze gets LOTS of extra credit for a) the ""Allergens Filter"" on their menu - fantastic for finding Gluten Free options, for example, and b) for offering SO MANY Gluten Free options including their pancakes, waffles, Benedict's and so much more - paradise for those who are Celiac."
,,,,,Thank you for sharing! We always love when folks have a good time at Snooze. We hope to sweep you off your feet again soon!
,,,,,I was able to finally slide through to Snooze for breakfast this Sunday after church service. Shame I got there before 10am so they weren't serving alcohol yet  (probably best not to defile the Lord's day). 
,,,,,"I was able to find some street parking pretty early but parking can become an issue as the parking lot is quite small and fits only about 8 cars.  I was able to be seated immediately at the bar which was good cause I was a party of one. They did a good job of still maintaining social distancing. They separate the 3 seats at the bar and you can only have a party of 2 for bar seating. There is sanitizer at the door, the staff is wearing mask and gloves so all COVID protocols are covered."
,,,,,"I ordered the pork belly Benedict which is pictured with an orange juice because the mimosas weren't available. I will tell you the presentation was great. The food was hot, fresh, and smelled immaculate. The American diner feel and the 80s/90s music playing had me thinking this was going to be all kinds of scrumptious. I was however a bit disappointed. The whole dish lacked flavor. The pork belly was crispy but it seemed unseasoned. I would say the same for the hash browns minus the crispy (which is probably due to the container that it is cooked in and how it's cooked). The hollandaise sauce was pretty bland as well. "
,,,,,There was a bright spot though. I was served a free cinnamon roll pancake which isn't on the menu but if you have a sweet tooth you need to try. It was delicious. The two things that saved my experience was the pancake and the service which were both A1. I will come back but for now I would say 3-stars.
,,,,,"Always a great brunch choice. The pancakes are decadent, fluffy, and absolutely delicious! The food is always consistently amazing."
,,,,,Explosive!! 10/10 would recommend 
,,,,,"Food: For starters, they have complementary coffee while you wait. I've never seen this at a restaurant and I was extremely impressed by it! I ordered the Snooze Classic with French Toast and a Pineapple Mimosa. The French toast was very good but the cream cheese on top was too sweet; everything else was perfect! "
,,,,,Atmosphere: The restaurant is very busy and popping but it's worth the wait. It's larger than it appears and has a lot of seating. It's a cute and comfortable restaurant. The hosts and servers were great as well!
,,,,,"This Colorado turned TX hotspot is a breakfast lovers dream.  Service can get a little clogged sometimes (but only because they have QUITE the following and can be packed during brunch times). I'm a fan of getting the pancake flight for the table to share as an appetizer and then everyone can have a bite of something sweet and save themselves for the savory stuff. I love the benedict choices, they are always inventive and tasty!"
,,,,,I've been here a couple times and the service has been really crappy i just left from eating today and our server literally passed by us 3 times before taking our drinks she had other tables and was engaging which is not a problem but when you're ignoring us and we're behind you isn't cool i have never typed a bad review EVER but this had me fed up because this isn't the first time we've had bad service here the food is good just the service is shitty she didn't bring us straws nor silverware we got our food and we were just staring at it we had to ask for silverware and then when it was time to pay no where to be found we had to walk to the front to pay they need help on hospitality! I love snooze so much the one in Webster is excellent but i moved closer to downtown and that's the closest one to me so it sucks when i want a good on the go breakfast but have horrible service.
,,,,,"One of my favorite brunch places! The food is just as good as it looks! We got the OMG! French Toast, the Breakfast Pot Pie, and the Ava-ca-dabra Mimosa! They all tasted sooooo good! And can we talk about that plating  i just wish the French Toast came with more strawberries, but other than that no complaints! The servers were really nice, and the food came fast too  the only thing is I would say the ambiance was ok. The diner doesn't look too special, but the service and food definitely make up for it!"

,,,,,This is so wonderful to hear! Thank you for letting us know that you love Snooze. We love you back and hope to see you again soon!
,,,,,"Snooze offers a good brunch selection and great coffee. I should have started drinking the coffee while waiting in line as others did! However, I was too preoccupied playing a jumbo connect four game right outside the door. "
,,,,,"Unlike some of the other reviews, our waiter did not rush us at all, in fact we had to ask for our check earlier than we would have liked in order to get to a church service on time. "
,,,,,"As for food, the Bella Bella benny was delicious, but a tad light on the prosciutto. I loved the hot sauce selection just be careful as they have some ghost pepper sauces! If sugary goodness is more what you're after, my friend ordered a pancake flight that would satisfy any sweet tooth"
,,,,,"Although it appeared smaller than expected on the inside there was more than enough space. Atmosphere was relaxed. A nice to place to go to for a quick brunch with friends or family. It gave off an upscale diner vibe. I ordered 2 sunny side up eggs, a pancake flight: sweet potato, blueberry and pineapple upside down, and eggs Benedict: Habanero pork belly and salmon, and mimosas. I would recommend those 2 choices if you ever plan on visiting. Overall, my favorite part of this meal was the habanero pork belly eggs Benedict and sweet potato pancake. Service was good, fast and reliable"
,,,,,"I've always had an eye for spotting out the best food spots wherever I am. So when I visited Houston this summer, I knew this place would be a hit. Cozy vibe, great staff, & when I tasted the Shrimp and grits my foodie heart went into heaven! I got it fully loaded with my eggs scrambled & did not disappoint! Their specialty pancakes are to die for & I love that there's healthier options to choose from. So when my husband & I visited again a few months later, we had to stop by again! Highly recommended."
,,,,,This is so wonderful to hear! Thank you for letting us know that you love Snooze. We love you back and hope to see you again soon!
,,,,,"Snooze, the location from heaven. Went there to celebrate my birthday with 3 other friends. One of the best locations, but the food at the other 2 I visited was also good. I forgot the name of the drink the Manager Indya recommended, but it was delish... She came to check on us to make sure our experience was enjoyable and it was just that.... The Sweet Potato Pancakes was OMG delicious..... Top of the line service..."

,,,,,Thank you for sharing! We always love when folks have a good time at Snooze. We hope to sweep you off your feet again soon!
,,,,,Ate here a while ago but I do remember that the French Toast was fantastic and the Mimosa was amazing. My wife's Benedict was amazing and the staff were fantastic. There was a bit of a wait but it was definitely worth it!

,,,,,My husband the pineapple upside down pancakes. We have been several times and it's all he orders. I have had the ham Benedict and just a side order of eggs. All very good. I ordered hot chocolate and wowee!  I'm pretty picky. I only like it made with milk. It came in a regular sized glass with a huge dollop of whipped cream and some sugar sprinkles that I think were carmalized. Wow it was so good.
,,,,,The French toast was everything!!! I wonder if they're affiliated with Snooze in San Fran. Either way I loved the food.
,,,,,"For somewhere that always has such a long wait, I expected better food. "
,,,,,"It is OK breakfast food, and the prices are competitive, but with so many delicious restaurants in the city, I would try somewhere else. "
,,,,,"The service is always good, as are the pancakes, but nothing to rave home about."
,,,,,Loved our service!
,,,,,Our waitress Alexis was amazing and even treated us to a Choco chip pancake! Such a delight
,,,,,The iced latte was heaven 
,,,,,Thank you snooze!!

,,,,,"The food was good. I had the bravocado toast and I really liked it but it was not above average. I also tried the pancake sampler and out of the 3, my favorite was the sweet potato one. As for drinks, I'm not a fan of vodka but I was hungover and ordered a Bloody Mary, but then I saw they have a Bloody Maria, which has tequila instead of vodka so I ordered that instead and it was bomb. Definitely recommend this place for brunch. It just gets really busy and the wait time is long so if you can, get on the waitlist on Yelp ahead of time"
,,,,,This is so wonderful to hear! Thank you for letting us know that you love Snooze. We love you back and hope to see you again soon!
,,,,,"I love to try different breakfast spots, mostly because I'm not a fan of breakfast style food , I like more of a brunch . This was a good spot for sure. I had the tostada tacos. And a singular pancake. The pancake was ok but the eggs were really good. My kid had some good hashies too.The negative is that the location in montrose area has terrible parking options. I will probably not come back to this onw"
,,,,,Great food very good service they also were very minded about Covid 19 would recommend it to anyone with a healthy appetite
,,,,,"Their ""fresh pressed"" green juice is not fresh at all came directly from the bottle of store bought green juice. Very disappointed with this substitution."
,,,,,"Hey there Nia, thank you for the feedback! We have passed it along to our team, and we hope to take your next experience from Okay to Amazing! We hope to see you again soon!"
,,,,,"We had high expectations, but unfortunately the food here fell quite short. Our server was doing his best, but he had way too many tables and just couldn't keep up. We heard folks from multiple tables around us whose orders were incorrect. We got what we ordered, but it took over 30 min from the time we ordered. And then it was just meh at best."
,,,,,"Hi Scott,"
,,,,,"We're sorry to hear you didn't have a great visit the last time you were in. We'd like to get a little more information about your experience and use it to make our team stronger. Would you mind emailing us with ""Montrose 6/25"" as the subject to "
,,,,,? We hope to hear from you.
,,,,,"Always love this place. I have gotten their bountiful breakfast bowl with a fried egg and chorizo. Nomnom. I've also had their chocolate chip pancake, and their breakfast taco. "
,,,,,"Parking at this location is very difficult, but the food outweighs the cons."
,,,,,"Wow! Thank you for your fantastic review, Alex! We are thrilled that you loved your experience at Snooze and look forward to seeing you again. Happy Brunching!"
,,,,,"I've always been a fan of snooze but this was my first time at this location. Even though from the exterior it looks really small, they have a lot of tables inside and turn over tables pretty quickly. We waited for 20 minutes for our table which is one of the shortest wait time I've had for a Saturday morning. "
,,,,,Food was delectable as always. Service was great. Parking is always a struggle so expect to either wait or hunt for street parking. Looking forward to my next visit.
,,,,,"As a brunch lover on a budget, I've been dying to try Snooze for quite some time. It's a tad expensive for my taste, but I decided to splurge after a late night with my friend A."
,,,,,"I've heard stories about the ridiculous wait times here, but fortunately we didn't experience that given how early on a Sunday morning we arrived. We came around 10 am and were given a table after a 20 minute wait. We'd already made our brunch selections and were in a bit of a hurry, so we ordered immediately on being seated."
,,,,,"We decided to share the pancake flight with the cannoli, pineapple upside down, and blueberry danish pancakes, and the Smashed Avocado Benny."
,,,,,"Our food came out fairly quickly, and we were not disappointed. The portion sizes were pretty big for two college-age women, so we ended up taking a lot of the food to go. The cannoli pancake was a bit sweet for me, but I adored the pineapple upside down and blueberry danish ones. Specialty pancakes are one of my weaknesses, and let's just say that Snooze pancakes took my breath away. The Benny we ordered was similarly tasty, but didn't seem as inspired as the rest of the menu. My next time here, I'd like to try one of the meat Benny options to see how it compares."
,,,,,"Upon finishing, we were given an electronic tablet to pay for our meal. This is definitely better if you're paying with credit card, but cash is a bit of a nightmare as you have to wait for already busy servers to come give you change. Regardless, Snooze was a pretty great experience and I'll definitely be back (though sometime EARLY to avoid those pesky lines...)"
,,,,,"I came here with my girlfriend because she cant shut up about the freaking pancakes here, and I can see why she does now. They were actually pretty good but I am not a fan of sweets myself. I am giving four stars because unfortunately our wait time to get seated kept fluctuating so it was a bit much... I liked the omelet I go, hope to try something different when we come back. The breakfast was overall very good and service was too. We will probably try to come back at a less busy time next time we eat here."

,,,,,Hope to see you for brunch again sometime soon!
,,,,,Came here for lunch. We arrived at 11:30ish and we were sat right away. First look- the ambience is pretty neat. Loved the decoration.
,,,,,Now for the cons: 
,,,,,Service was TERRIBLE. Took forever to get our drinks AND our food. We were hopeful that the food would be amazing and that all of the waiting and hunger would be worth it. WRONG. I have seen all of the reviews and was almost sure that this place's food would be Top Notch and was SO disappointed. Food came out cold and everything was so bland. We were so hungry we ate the food anyways and after.. waited over 20 minutes for our check and I had to go to work. Forgot to mention my family and I had the bubble guts from the food we were served after. Not a good way to go back to work! 
,,,,," Btw their ""chorizo"" was a hard patty that was shameful to look at as a Mexican American."

,,,,,Snooze is a classic brunch place! My favorite is the pancake flight - gives you an opportunity to try three flavors! You can also try french toast in the flight as well! Their to-go service is prompt and great customer service!
,,,,,"We were a group of 9 people seated on 2 tables due to covid. Everyone loved their food. I ordered garden harvest omlet and it was delicious. I could only eat 1/2 . Pancakes, French toast was good too. "
,,,,,Things that didn't meet expectations 
,,,,,- hash brown had a really strong after taste and was greasy in taste. I would say worst one I had ever had.
,,,,,"I do love my Snooze! The mimosas are one of my favorites, but the only reason I am giving this location only 3 stars is because of the service."
,,,,,"On our arrival, the parking lot was crazy full. People were stacked waiting for spaces like there was a going out of business sale. It made it a little exciting to see."
,,,,,"We checked in and were told there was a 30 minute wait. Eventually they called our name from inside and we were waiting outside. When we got the text, we responded and were told ""sorry you're too late we already gave your table away. But we will seat you soon."" Only seconds later we were seated."
,,,,,At the table we were given dirty menus and a sticky table. Our drink order was taken immediately and brought to us just as quickly. I requested silverware and creamer only to wait until my coffee was cold and my orange juice was finished.
,,,,,Everything coming out of the Kitchen looks and smells amazing! Seems like many people order some variation of pancakes or Benedict from what passes by our table.
,,,,,We ordered pancakes and Benedict. The Pancakes were very dry and the drizzle was quite tasty. The Benedict's were interesting good. Tons of flavor and the hollandaise was incredible.
,,,,,There were many staff shuffling plates and people making things a little hectic and distracting. The music was pumping and loud. The decor was retro modern. The give a high tech receipt on a tablet you self service.
,,,,,"A complaint is that the personal interacting with the server or host is lacking. As I finished my plate, it was quickly grabbed and the receipt device was placed on our table."
,,,,,"It's a place to go if you are a trendy hipster. If you are hungry now, forget it. Wait times will leave you hungry. The crowd at the door will make you irritated."
,,,,,So was in Houston visiting and woke up wanting to try some food spots. One good spot that jumped out because if it's name. Snooze. I thought it was a funny name. So i pulled up and the scene was in a nice area and that was truly a plus. (Needs more parking only complaint) 
,,,,,Menu is next on the list. Options options options. I love that they have so many options to choose from. It's a little overwhelming but in a good way. Since I'm trying to stay on my life style i went with the breakfast tacos and this was my first time trying a tofu meat substitute. It was really good. I thought i was not going like it but man oh man was i wrong. I also had a mimosa with it to compliment. 
,,,,,Overall it was a great experience. Can truly say one of the better brunch spots i have eaten in a while. It was so good. The service was great and most importantly not overcharging.
,,,,,We stopped here for breakfast during our quick stay in houston.
,,,,,"So glad, it was a great experience very tasty, good quality and simple ingredients"
,,,,,Would go back
,,,,,"I had a fantastic brunch at Snooze this morning! Arriving as early as 9am, the wait was still ~30 minutes...but after finally getting a chance to try the place I see why Snooze gets long lines out the door!"
,,,,,"We were quickly helped and our server was very kind. I tried the Ooo La La Frittata, which was like a scrambled egg pancake with cheese, asparagus, cucumbers, and topped with a salad. It definitely didn't disappoint, and it was really flavorful! I also got the nitro cold brew, which was okay and not as strong as I would have liked."
,,,,,"I also had the chance to try the Sweet Potato Hash (which was also light and flavorful), the Steak + Eggs Benny (really dense and delicious)."
,,,,,Definitely satisfied with my experience at Snooze. I'd been talking about visiting it for months and I now understand the hype.
,,,,,"This is my favorite breakfast spot so glad It came to Atlanta. Don't eat your normal French toast and eggs try something different because it's always good, and their house hot sauce is so good on the hash browns."
,,,,,The ambiance is great and the food is delicious! The staff is super friendly! I love the pineapple pancakes!
,,,,,This is so wonderful to hear! Thank you for letting us know that you love Snooze. We love you back and hope to see you again soon!
,,,,,"I finally made it to Snooze and it did not disappoint. Going on a weekday was a great way to avoid a long wait time (or any wait time at all). I didn't have a reservation but was promptly seated on the patio per my request. Since it was my first time, I asked for a few recommendations and ordered the Mmm Mmm Mimosa and the Benny Duo where you can select two different Benedicts to try. I ordered the Bella Bella Benny and the Lox-n-Latke. The lox Benedict was amazing! I'm still dreaming about it. The combination of salmon, pickled onions and capers was something I would never imagine but it was delicious. I wish I had ordered two. Unfortunately I was given the Smashed Avocado Benny by mistake and it took a while to get my correct order out. The Bella Benny didn't live up to my expectations but that's ok. I'd go back for the lox anytime."

,,,,,"Snooze is definitely our favorite breakfast/brunch spot. The service is always great, the food is consistent, and the prices are decent. The menu is huge and there are plenty of vegan and gluten free options. The acoustics of the inside dining room aren't great and the music can be really overbearing at times, but that's easily rectified by sitting outside on the patio (which is amazing in the spring and fall). "
,,,,,"For vegans, I highly recommend trying the tofu scramble with soyrizo, red peppers, and avocado. If you order corn tortillas instead of toast you can make delicious breakfast tacos. My fiancé loves the scramble with barbacoa, cotija, and avocado, so that's a great option for omnivores. The hashbrowns at Snooze are the best, so definitely be sure and try those while you're there. There are also gluten free pancakes, but unfortunately they're not vegan (please change that, Snooze! Vegan pancakes are super easy to make and better for the planet!). Overall, we love Snooze and will continue to make it a weekly Saturday treat."
,,,,,This am food is so good close to my fav restaurant

,,,,,"Enjoyed a 3 egg omelette with spinach, sausage and Jack cheese. "
,,,,,it was served with a round hash brown and two warmed tortilla.
,,,,,my husband enjoyed the sweet potato pancakes with the flavorful syrup and pecans. We shared each other's breakfast and were quite satisfied.
,,,,,We had a wait but it was not long and our waitress was very nice and helpful. 
,,,,,My husband had a coffee which he said was just okay. Glad we went again as it is a nice treat to start the day. We will definitely return
,,,,,"After having a not so great experience that I had posted on yelp, I was contacted by Becky. Whe went back and forth about my experience and Snooze kindly sent me a gift card to apologize and give them another opportunity. We went there today for a late breakfast and of course had to wait. We had given our phone # and watched while other people after us were seated. My husband apparently did not feel the vibration on his phone. So he complained and found the text after we were seated. We did have a nice tasty enjoyable meal. We both had omelettes, mine with wild mushrooms, Swiss cheese and hollandise sauce on the side. My husband's with peppers, bacon and cheddar cheese. They both came with the round hash browns and I had tortillas and my husband had toast with some jam they put on the side. Our server was very nice and friendly and we asked about a serving of the sweet potato pancakes that my husband loves and she recommended to get one which was plenty. The food was delicious and the service was outstanding this time. It's a bit of a splurge for us but we definitely enjoyed it so much better. The gift card covered the meal since my husband had coffee and I had water. Thanks again Becky for the generous gift card. We tipped our server well and we had a great meal. By the way our server's name I think was Candice."
,,,,,"Joined the online waitlist for 30min, finally got called but could not find parking or get into the restaurant. They are letting people hang out in front of the restaurant and block the entrance making it impossible to to park in their lot and all parking on the street was full too. This is not surprising since they apparently do not turn anyone away but instead allow people to keep joining the waitlist to overrun the parking and waiting areas. This location is just not managed well, the other locations do not have this problem. We have been to this location several times and it is always like this, but usually we have all morning to sit around waiting for a parking spot and table - just got tired of waiting around today."

,,,,,"I got Snooze takeout and had a wonderful experience with Habanero Pork Belly Benny (Egg Benedict) and Pineapple Upside Down Pancakes. The Egg Benedict was super delicious and not overly salty compared the egg benedict I had in some other brunch places. Although it didn't look like a large amount of food but it turned out to be surprisingly filling. The pineapple pancakes is also quite a lovely experience. It was not overly sweet but definitely still satisfied my sweet tooth for the day. Also, if you are planning to do a long hike later in theday like I did, the calorie per dollar ratio for these pancakes is definitely the way to go!"
,,,,,"Worst service. Had a reservation & I booked it 20 miles out in advance (the app only allowed to reserve if your within 20 miles) which is fine. I had a reservation time of 1:30 & got there to check in at 1 PM (just in case there was earlier seating) we didn't get seated til about 2:15 PM. MIND YOU WE MADE A RESERVATION AT 12:40. They seated MULTIPLE parties before ours. I understand one or two parties, but at least 6 parties of at LEAST 5 people each. Each time I asked the host when we will be seated she had an attitude & kept switching the stories on which table we would sit at twice. Most of my party left at 2 Pm, so 2:15 (WHEN MOST OF OUR GROUP LEFT) they seated just 4 of us. Worst server. Bad host. If I can get less stars I definitely would, sucks cause Snooze was my favorite place to go til I received such horrible service."

,,,,,"Amazing amazing amazing! Never disappointed! This place is amazing! Use the waitlist great feature! Been to Austin and Colorado locations! Spot on! Every pancake can be made Gluten free, have coconut and oat milk! Spot on! Did I say I love this place! Austin serves free coffee while waiting as well!"

,,,,,"Breakfast tasted  great, but the music is too loud. The blaring rock music made me nauseous. Great for the gym or a club/bar. Not for breakfast."
,,,,,"After waiting in line for eternity and leaving several times, I finally made the cut at the much ballyhooed Snooze in Montrose. Got 3 over easy, bacon and hash browns with toast. Bacon was limp and greasy. The rest was OK, but that's it, OK. Service was good, but I wouldn't recommend waiting in a line or paying extra for the right to say you had breakfast at Snooze. The food at Avalon and House of Pies is better and cheaper. Unless you like to be seen eating breakfast, I'd recommend other sensible venues."

,,,,,I'm a regular customer to snooze. Usually get the OMG French toast and the classic. Great food! 
,,,,,The waiter was ok. She look down on her luck. The food made up for it!
,,,,,"I typically enjoy eating at Snooze, particularly this one. I tried the online system today, it took them 48 minutes to get some blueberry pancakes out, when I asked why the order was taking so long I was informed that their online system only releases orders to the bar once 6 orders have been placed. I spoke to the manager about how ridiculous of a system that is, why should I have to wait til there's 5 additional orders before my order gets ticketed and released. She was completely condescending and uncaring about this situation, I regret not asking her name. She's the African American lady with round glasses and blonde ombré hair, giving ppl a dead stare while they voice something that could be better for your establishment is a real bad look. She could have at least offered a fake apology to go with her condescending demeanor about it taking 40 minutes to make some blueberry pancakes.   "

,,,,,The food is always delicious at Snooze. The service is also good here. It is a small location and parking can be a challenge on busy days. There is a small parking lot but street parking is available as well. The wait is always long so I would recommend joining the yelp wait list before heading over to the restaurant. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. It is definitely one of our favorite breakfast spots. I usually always get the snooze classic because I love the hash browns. My kids love the pancakes.
,,,,,This is so wonderful to hear! Thank you for letting us know that you love Snooze. We love you back and hope to see you again soon!
,,,,,The short version:
,,,,,"Excellent food, horrible service. "
,,,,,The longer version:
,,,,,"As soon as we walked in the man behind the counter is yelling at a lady in the waiting area that her to go order is ready. She is on the phone and doesn't hear him. He walks over and yells ""JENNIFER! YOOR ORDER IS READY, I called you 3 times already"". He then seats us and just seems like he woke up on the wrong side of the bed. "
,,,,,Our waiter kind of had the same energy. His demeanor was cold. We would say thank you and receive no response or acknowledgement. It was weird. Other locations are always amazing. I won't be back to this location ever again. The food was amazing though so I'll give them credit for that.

,,,,,Went to snooze on a Friday morning around 10am. The wait was about 35 minutes for a table and they text your phone when your table is ready. Their is a coffee station set up in front for you while you wait. Staff was super friendly and our waiter  (I think his name was Aaron) was really funny and made the experience more enjoyable. We ordered the Mm mmm mimosas while we waited on our food. They were pretty tasty and I will order them again. The food was really tasty and flavorful with a nice presentation. Minus one star because there is not enough parking and no valet. Unless you wait for someone to leave you will most likely have to park down the block on the street. Worth a visit though.

You should definitely put your name down on the waitlist online at least 45 minutes in advance of when you plan on dining because there is a long wait on weekends. Parking can be a bit of a headache, but usually I find street parking nearby and don't mind walking a bit to the restaurant. However, these minor inconveniences are well worth the quality and taste of the brunch. I love all of the pancake and mimosa flavors, and I'd especially order the Abri-ca-lav-ra mimosa over and over again. I'd also recommend picking two of the eggs benedict for a Benny Duo, AND try the the BACON BUT DIFFERENT (so sweet, spicy, crunchy, unique--I wish I had known about this one sooner)!!! I've been here countless times over the past 8 years, and Snooze food and service always meet my expectations."

,,,,,"I'm a pancake connoisseur.  This place is definitely on my list!  Pineapple Upside Down pancake was awesome!  The Lox-N-Latke Benny have a different twist, which changed my whole thoughts on an eggs Benedict dish.  Great job Snooze!  I will be back for sure!"
,,,,,Wow! We love to hear that you had a great time at Snooze! Thank you so much for your feedback. Come see us again soon!
,,,,,"I can't comment on how the food is when you dine in here as it's been a while, but I can safely say that the quality of the take-out is shit. Nearly a year ago I ordered some pancakes and a latte; the pancakes were literally burnt and the latte was genuinely the most burnt and disgusting one I've ever had. Then today I thought I'd try again and pretty much the same result--extremely overcooked, tough, inedible pancakes. Such a waste of money. Honestly I wonder if because they know it's an online order they just don't bother to try at all."
,,,,,Don't order from here unless you're okay with having to check everything you order and ask for it to be remade.

,,,,,"Fully overrated.  I cannot understand why there is always a line out of the door at this place. Food is nothing special. Kitschy fake diner experience.  So many other real old school diners nearby with better food, better service."
,,,,,"Hi Erin,"
,,,,,"We’re sorry to hear you feel Snooze is all hype! We’d like to hear more about what happened, if you’d be willing to share it with us. I think we can knock your socks off next time! Would you mind emailing us at "

,,,,,"I have to give it 5 stars for the food. We went for breakfast and it did not disappoint. The sweet potato bacon mash up is so delicious, with small pieces of bacon with a maple drizzle sprinkled over a soft, griddled sweet potato, all topped with a poached egg and avocado. The perfect balance of savory and sweet if you can't decide between the two for breakfast! Juan's breakfast tacos were also very tasty with the green chile hollandaise sauce, which wasn't overpowering. They were a sizeable portion for 3 tacos. The Corned Beef hash was another great plate, with tender, salty corned beef mixed in with hashbrowns and an egg of the side. This was a hearty dish, and the meat was very tender and moist. The chorizo is also really great as a protein option, it comes in patty form but is definitely packed with flavor."
,,,,,"For the service, I might be inclined to give it 3-4 stars. This is a very busy, popular spot but it took a while for the server to come over and take our order. Then after we ordered, it took a bit for the food to come. Everyone was very kind, but it was just a little slow so by the time our food came we were pretty hungry. But other than that, the staff is full of smiling faces and I would say that the food was worth the wait."

,,,,,Literally love coming here for brunch! Today I had the Bella Bella Benny-- probably my favorite Benedict from snooze ! Today the bread under the eggs was a little smaller than usual which was unfortunate. The eggs were great though. Tried the vanilla almond matcha latte and it was delicious ! I love the alternative milk options snooze has!
,,,,,This is so wonderful to hear! Thank you for letting us know that you love Snooze. We love you back and hope to see you again soon!
,,,,,"I can't say enough positive things about this particular establishment. The food is excellent but the service, we were  blessed to have a server named ""Mary F.""  Mary was super friendly and attentive. She really helped make the early morning breakfast experience one of the best in Houston. "
,,,,,"Out of 5 stars give Mary F. And ""Snooze"" a 6. It's that good. Be sure and try the robbed maple bacon! With brown surgery! "
,,,,,"And as an added ""enhancement,"" be sure and ask for ""Mary F."" To complete your experrice."
,,,,,"I loved this place! Where else can you get bacon/jalapeño glazed bacon? Nowhere, that's where! "
,,,,,"Really busy and long waits are a downer. But if you go and catch them on a slow day, heaven awaits!"
,,,,,"Not sure if they're having an off day, but the service was terrible. This I was not a great first impression. Our waiter went extremely long periods without checking in on our table and we waited almost an hour for food. The food wasn't even that great once we did get it. The manager ended up comping part our meal to make up for it."
,,,,,"Hi Gabrielle,"

,,,,,I really enjoyed this Montrose location is Snooze. I hate that I didn't get the waitress name. She was awesome and gave us a free pancake for being great guests! I'm definitely putting this spot on the Hot places to go to for brunch! Our guests from out of town loved it as well!!
,,,,,"For starters, the service, ambiance and food was incredible, 10/10 without a doubt! My partner and I are always seeking multiple dishes every order and we decided to choose the OMG! French Toast and the 3 Egg Omelet with tomatoes, spinach and goat cheese. Needless to say every bite was burst of savory flavors in my mouth! Everything was fantastic and the French Toast was the BEST I've ever had, better than my mom's family recipe! Can't wait to go back to this place when I visit Houston again and try the numerous egg Benedict options on the menu!"
,,,,,Thank you for sharing! We always love when folks have a good time at Snooze. We hope to sweep you off your feet again soon!
,,,,,Very popular place. Food was good and wasn't too expensive. Utensils were not super clean though.
,,,,,"Pretty awesome food. I went early in the morning around 7am so there wasn't as much as a crowd. I ordered the OmG French toast, beef hash, and scrambled eggs with cheese. Food was absolutely delicious. I definitely recommend"
,,,,,"Wow! Thank you for your fantastic review, Margrett! We are thrilled that you loved your experience at Snooze and look forward to seeing you again. Happy Brunching!"
,,,,,Covid procedures in place. I called to see if I can have my name put on the list and was told it was first come first serve. Then I stand in line only to find out yu still have to go inside to put your name on the list. The Yelp waitlist link didn't work. Then other ppl walked straight up and put their name on the list before mine. Instructions need to be posted on the door and nearby windows. The sign that's by the door needs to be by the entrance of the side walk. Being that people walked a mile to get to the door when there's no parking. And more than one would help. If I wasn't about to starve to death I would've left. Will update review after I eat.
,,,,,Update. Food was fabulous. Bartender is nice and makes pretty good mimosas. Menu could use improvement. No pancake or French toast combos include bacon or eggs. Everything is separate. Individual Pancake is $5. 
,,,,,Good place to impress a lady for breakfast but be prepared to spend dinner prices.
,,,,,"Hi Cierra,"
,,,,,"We're sorry to hear you didn't have a great time with our waitlist the last time you were in. We'd like to get a little more information about your experience and use it to make our team stronger. Would you mind emailing us with ""Montrose 9/21 Yelp"" as the subject to "

,,,,,"Amazing!!!! I've been to snooze only twice and the first time was in the woodlands area but this location was perfect besides the wait which was about 1.5 hr it was sure worth the wait. I tried the shrimp and grits which were on point, great flavor and I didn't even have to add any salt & pepper. I also ordered the pineapple upside down pancakes which I've had before and they were out of this world; something I cannot even describe I can eat those everyday. I never order alcoholic beverages here but I was tempted and it was a celebration so my friend and I ordered the lavender & regular mimosa and the lavender one was perfect and was better than any drink I've tasted before; I should have ordered two instead of getting the pineapple mimosa. The drinks had the perfect amount of alcohol in it."

I love pineapple, so when I heard about this pancake, I knew I had to go try it and I wasn't disappointed. So when some friends came to town I immediate suggested this place for brunch again. Everyone was happy with the choice. "
,,,,,"Snooze has a bright, cozy vibe, good music playing in the background, a friendly waitstaff, and great brunch food. A must have on your Houston brunch list!"
,,,,,This place will get busy during popular brunch time so either come early or be prepared to wait 1+ hours. Also parking is limited so be prepared to find street parking. But all this just means this place is THAT GOOD.

,,,,,I can'r believe i lived in Midtown for years and never stopped by Snooze to catch some brunch. Better late then never. The wait time is pretty lengthy on a saturday but It was worth it. My Server GABRIEL was amazing. He made all the right recommendations on the food and gave me water and asked if I needed ketchup salt pepper or hot sauce without me asking him for it. Big plus. Not that many servers take pride in working so it's nice to get michelin star like service and a local brunch staple.
,,,,,Well worth the wait! Awesome menu and great drinks. Love to get the pineapple upside down pancake!
,,,,,"Wow! Thank you for your fantastic review, Celeste-Schjaun! We are thrilled that you loved your experience at Snooze and look forward to seeing you again. Happy Brunching!"

,,,,,Thank you for sharing! We always love when folks have a good time at Snooze. We hope to sweep you off your feet again soon!
,,,,,"You can definitely almost always expect a long wait here, but that's how you know this place is GOOD! It's honestly a little pricey too, but this is one of my favorite brunch places that I don't mind splurging on every once in a while. This environment has a very busy and social vibe. It's great for catching up with friends."
,,,,,"One of my favorite menu go-to items is the Benny Duo (5/5). I'm indecisive and I can't decide on just one of the eggs Benedict dishes, so this allows me to pick 2! I get the Chili Verde Benedict + Benny Goodman. Also one of my favorite things about this dish? It comes with a large pile of hash browns that I just LOVE. Pro trip: ask for hot sauce to eat with this dish too for a nice little kick and extra flavor! "
,,,,,"I came here with a group of friends and we also tried the pancake flight (5/5). We all wanted to try something sweet too but didn't want to commit to just 1 dish of sweetness, so we all split it. I definitely recommend this if you're coming here with a group of 3-4 people who want to split some pancakes. We got the pineapple upside down pancake, chocolate chip, and blueberry pancake. (We ordered this on top of our own separate dishes.)"
,,,,,"The most recent time I came here, I wanted to order something different, so I tried the sweet potato bacon smash up (5/5). This felt like a slightly healthier dish, and it was honestly VERY filling and delicious. I also smothered it with hot sauce to give it a nice kick. I would recommend this dish!"
,,,,,Their coffee is also really good too! I get the vanilla iced latte when I come here.
,,,,,"I am addicted to the French toast!! I dream about it! Hard to get a reservation & a long stand by, but worth the wait! Servers are fun and nice :) Got my food in good time."
,,,,,Thank you for sharing! We always love when folks have a good time at Snooze. We hope to sweep you off your feet again soon!
,,,,,Cute breakfast spot with good amount of tasty options. My friend suggested this place as it was my first time visiting the area. I wanted something sweet so i decided on the pancake flight which offered 3 different pancakes from the menu and it was customizable. I got the traditional flight and the danish was my favorite hands down followed by the sweet potato. It was absolutely freezing and the caramel latte was warm and refreshing. Would definitely recommend this place.
,,,,,"Great prices, great customer service, and good-sized portions of food! I'm not a sweet tooth and ended up getting something sweet since they look like they're known for their pancakes (I got a strawberry shortcake pancake) and almost wish I had the stomach for their savory breakfast options."
,,,,,Make sure you make a reservation since it gets busy quickly!
,,,,,This is so wonderful to hear! Thank you for letting us know that you love Snooze. We love you back and hope to see you again soon!
,,,,,Snooze is always a great experience. The staff is friendly and the food is great! Large portions and the food is cooked perfectly every time. Today was no wait so that's a plus
,,,,,Chocolate chip pancakes hit my craving just right! I also ordered a side of sausage patties which were gross. But the pancakes were unforgettable!

,,,,,Sorry for the photos. Food was too good to not eat before snapping a photo. The food was amazing and so fulfilling! The mimosas were great and did its job. My fiancé and I really enjoyed ourselves. This location is practicing social distancing. I thought it was really cool when you pay your bill you're given this digital tablet like thing and you take care of it without waiting for your waitress to pick up your card and return your receipt to sign. 
,,,,,Highly recommend dining here.
,,,,,So delicious! I got the Benny duo with pork belly and the barbacoa verde. The pork belly was a perfect combination of fatty and meaty. I really loved the level of spice as well! Very nice staff and great vibes.

My favorite pancakes was the sweet potato and then the blueberries Danish. Food came out fresh and hot I can see why this chain is so popular down here!"

,,,,,"This place is super busy for brunch on weekends but definitely worth the wait. Thankfully, we joined the waitlist online before we headed over and only had to wait about 15 minutes (about as long as it took to find parking) once we arrived. Our waitress Erykah was awesome and made great recommendations. She was so friendly and welcoming, made sure we were satisfied with our meals and engaged with our daughter to get some giggles out of her. My husband had eggs, chicken sausage, grits and Funky Monkey French toast. Omg that French toast, delish! Our daughter devoured her chocolate chip pancake. I had the sweet potato veggie smash up, light on the calories but full of flavor. We washed it all down with a rummosa and a brewmosa. Great brunch!"

,,,,,No complaints other than parking--and that's in their control. Met some friends after a long shift for breakfast and beverages. I got a regular bloody and a spicy bloody--both made with the housemade bloody mix that is on par and a lil skewer for decor. Had a hard time deciding on my meal considering alllll the options. Chose the breakfast pot pie--puff pastry that was perfectly fluffy and crispy topped with sausage gravy and a fried egg--served with us browns on the side. De-li-cious. Server was great and the handheld self checkout gig at the table was convenient. We were able to split the bill however we wanted to without bugging our server. Get their before 9 to beat the weekday morning rush.

,,,,,Everything was exceptional including the service - perfect breakfast !

,,,,,Thank you for sharing! We always love when folks have a good time at Snooze. We hope to sweep you off your feet again soon!
,,,,,The food at snooze needs more seasoning added. I had the lox benedict and the potatoes definitely needed more salt. The salad on the side had no dressing on it at all. It would have been nice to have a lit something on it. The service on my visit was decent.
,,,,,"Hey there Jasmine, thank you for the feedback! We have passed it along to our team, and we hope to take your next experience from Okay to Amazing! We hope to see you again soon!"
,,,,,Our group of 6 arrived and were seated quickly thanks to online reservation. Super convenient! Indoor dining is open and each table is sectioned off with a clear divider for safety. Doesn't look awkward or anything since it looks like part of the restaurant :)
,,,,,Menu is online through QR code and there's so many options! Tons of holiday specials as well
,,,,,"I got the Benedict to share which is perfect because you can choose two different Benedict's, and they can bring it out on separate plates too. Also got the pancake flight to share and it was perfect for a sampler of multiple pancake flavors"
,,,,,"First time eating at this chain. There was no wait , so we were seated immediately. My chai latte was nice and hot, just a little spicy, but very good. I ordered the breakfast pot pie and my mom got the French toast neat with a side with a side of bacon andAnd scrambled egg. Unfortunately we sent everything back because the temperature was lukewarm on all of our food. The waitress put a rush on our order and we were giving our next meal within 15 minutes which kind of begs the question... Once we got the food it was delicious. The bacon was delicious and crispy. The pot pie pastry was light airy fluffy and flaky. When we got our bill we were discounted a credit of $15 for the temperature of our food which we did not ask for and I thought was a nice touch. All in all, The food was solid and I will likely return"

,,,,,"COVID first.  Masks required. Social distancing enforced. Tables sanitized between guests.  Waiters wore masks. Some wore gloves.  But what really stood out was plexiglas shields between tables.  The menu is QR based, so bring your mobile phone. "
,,,,,"Now that that's out of the way, Snooze utilized a ""waitlist"" feature.  We ""logged in"", checked in when we arrived and got a text when our table was ready.  We had 13 folks ahead of us, and somehow got seated within 20 minutes.  Due to COVID, Snooze doesn't offer free coffee while you wait.  "
,,,,,"We were seated and promptly greeted by our server.  I started with grapefruit juice.  Fresh. Cold. And reasonably priced. My wife ordered a spiked, spiced apple cider.  A shot of rum and you've just kissed $9 goodbye.  By comparison, most entries are about $10-$14. "
,,,,,"The corned beef hash had chunks of corned beef mixed with hash browns and topped with eggs made your way.  Word to the wise here. If you ask for ""over easy "", they'll be served with a very runny yolk.  Ask for ""over easy medium"" for a little more firm center. Great flavor.  "
,,,,,"I ordered Spuds Deluxe.  Again, 2 eggs over hash browns and I added bacon & jalapeños.  I should have specified sautéed jalapeños, they were raw and very, very hot.  I thought the hash browns were a bit under done. I'd prefer them more crispy.  I'm sure there was bacon in there.  But it was chopped up rather than an actual slice.  Still, very tasty.  And portions were perfect.  Satisfying without distressing. "
,,,,,"There's a ton of servers roaming the floor.  And that led to some breakdowns in service. Our meals were delivered and the server (not our original order taker) took off like the Flash.  We sat for 5 minutes before we found our original waiter and reminded him we asked for honey, and that we needed salt, pepper & ketchup. He took off and another 5 minutes passed before a third server brought the condiments.  So, a 10 minute wait equals lukewarm food.  A tasty meal that could have been even better with more aware servers.  "
,,,,,"Finally.  Parking can be a challenge.  You can take a chance parking in private lots across the street.  Or, just circle til something opens up.  At the end of your meal, they hand you a tablet with your bill and you pay at your table.  Very efficient."
,,,,,By far my favorite houston breakfast stop when visiting. Food is always delicious and wait staff are great. Highly recommend to anyone who wants a new take on breakfast that will blow you away.

,,,,,Came in Saturday morning and thought it'd be packed but they didn't have us wait at all. 
,,,,,The parking is accessible everywhere. 
,,,,,I ordered the chai latte with oat milk and it was delicious. It was strong and didn't taste overly sweet like the usual syrups they use and I appreciated that. 
,,,,,I personalized my avocado toast and added soyrizo and it was bomb. I want to try the vegan pancakes next time. I liked that they had vegan options. 
,,,,,"My mom and sis ordered the veggie omelet, and pancakes and they cleared they plates out. "
,,,,,We were all so quiet eating at the table because we were all focused on the food.

,,,,,"Love this Snooze. Friendly staff and like how you can join waitlist through Yelp which I HIGHLY recommend if in the weekend. Sometimes the wait can be pretty crazy, so joining waitlist allows you to not have to go to restaurant til 15-20 min before seating time. Parking can sometimes be a bit of a hassle but once you are seated. Mmmmm!"
,,,,,"I am a big pancake fan and Snooze caters to this. Ask about the pancake of the week. It's not on the menu but different every week and created by a chef at one of the Snooze locations around the country. Are you vegan, vegetarian, GF, etc? Well Snooze has lots to choose from on the menu. The only thing that bugs me is no Splenda or Sweet N Low. They only have stevia which unfortunately for me causes the coffee to have a metallic taste. So I just bring my own Splenda. Haha. "
,,,,,"The Benedicts are a fave as well... as are the boozy morning drinks. I have found you can't go wrong. My advice is to get up and come early when there is no wait, but it is well worth the wait if you have to."

,,,,,"We decided to Door Dash Snooze for breakfast! We know we didn't make a mistake because the food was awesome. At first I was really skeptical because it was saying that it would take over an hour to deliver, but it took less than 40 minutes to get our food after delivering. I was so impressed at the time of preparing and actually cooking. "
,,,,,"Once we got our food, just by opening it, I was impressed. They package their food in compostable containers and to keep things not soggy and warm, they also have tin foil wrapping. "
,,,,,"I ordered the Spuds Deluxe with bacon and onions with the over easy egg. It was delicious. The bacon chunks were huge, and the onions were sautéed to the point where it wasn't the sharp bitter onion-y taste. The cheese was such a great pair to the potatoes as well. I would totally recommend going here if you have the time or even Door Dashing if you don't!"
,,,,,"I normally love coming to this location, but my last visit wasn't their usual. We waited quite a while for our waiter, and they seemed very put out about anything related to our table. Everyone liked their food, but I wish that the service had been better."

,,,,,"Overall I had heard good things about snooze, so when it was a rainy morning me and my girlfriend decided to splurge a little and get Snooze for brunch! There's a ton of menu options but I decided to get an omelette with a pancake on the side, and she got one of the kids meals with eggs, toast, and another side, because she wasn't too hungry. "
,,,,,"After ordering everything went downhill. The email we received with our confirmation said the order would be ready in 15 minutes and to wait in our car until we received a message. We showed up at the pickup time and waited for about 15 minutes in the car, before I decided to head in because I assumed they forget to notify us. I went inside and asked about pickup and they directed me to the bar area. I kept asking waiters and waitresses for help but got got no assistance or info from anyone. After about 15-20 minutes I finally heard my name and got my order, and never received any sort of notification about my order so the email confirmation we got was completely wrong about timing (ending up waiting like an hour) and what to do while waiting."
,,,,,"After waiting for so long I hoped my food would be at least warm and fresh, but instead my omelette was cold, my partner's eggs were as well, and they gave her the completely wrong sides. The only redeeming quality was the pancake i got on the side was pretty decent, but also not very warm. I've heard great things about this place in the past so not sure what happened, but not sure I'll be rushing back anytime soon."
,,,,,"Hi Christopher,"
,,,,,"We’re sorry to hear service has been less than amazing. We’d like to get a little more information from you, if you’d be willing to share it. Would you mind emailing us at "
,,,,, with “Montrose 7/10” as the subject? 
,,,,,We hope to hear from you.
,,,,,"My family likes to eat at places we don't have at home so we thought we try this place. No regrets here, everything we ordered was delicious and service was good."
,,,,,Wow! We love to hear that you had a great time at Snooze! Thank you so much for your feedback. Come see us again soon!

,,,,,"This was the first time I was placed on a waiting list with this location. However, it was worth the wait. The food was delectable and the service was very good."
,,,,,Thank you for sharing! We always love when folks have a good time at Snooze. We hope to sweep you off your feet again soon!
,,,,,"Good place for brunch!  We were meeting some friends here and because I've been burned by not checking the Yelp waitlist before, I had the right mind to check it this time and scheduled our wait in line for the time that we were planning to make it there.  Parked, got the text that our table was ready, and walked in immediately to our table - couldn't have gone smoother than that honestly.  The wait was getting up to an hour by the time we got there."
,,,,,"We got the snooze classic with scrambled eggs and the strawberry shortcake pancakes from the summer menu.  Our friends got the spuds deluxe and a lox-n-latke benny with the signature pancake flight for the table to share.  The strawberry pancakes were delicious, a bit sweet if you're eating earlier in the morning but still good!  No complaints about the snooze classic or the entrees from our friends either.  The pancake flight was pretty cool to have and I would recommend that for a small table to share.  It's a good mix of flavor to try quickly and all at once.  Would come here again!"
,,,,,This is so wonderful to hear! Thank you for letting us know that you love Snooze. We love you back and hope to see you again soon!
,,,,,"Wow!   Just all I can say.  Everyone loved their meal.  Sooooogoood.   The service was impecable. Our servor,, Tatiana was fabulous.  She was very patient with what I consider to be a difficult table. As a matter of fact, she turned them all into satisfied customers. And I can't leave out Dwight, who personally brought a hand wipe to one of the parties who spilled something"
,,,,,If you looking for a place with great mimosa.....try their their Snooze sparkling with Tito.   
,,,,,And each of the dishes left nothing to be desired. The kind of meal that make you wish they served bread with your meal so that you can sop up your plate and wipe it so clean that they put it on the shelf. Lol
,,,,,"Wow! Thank you for your fantastic review, Lynn! We are thrilled that you loved your experience at Snooze and look forward to seeing you again. Happy Brunching!"
,,,,,"I had been in the uphill search for the perfect egg Benedict for a vegetarian... Until I found this place. They allow so many customizations and the veggie alternatives (soyrizo) are SO good that you really can't go wrong with any of the Benedix on the menu. I don't wanna dedicate my whole review to the Benedicts but I use this as a measuring stick for all others (bc I can't keep eating crab Benedict). The sandwich I am, OMG French toast and pancakes are so flavorful and delicious every single time, and I've probably ordered 50+ times already. The dining experience is pretty great too, they've implemented Glass partitions which makes me feel secure but I'm not sure that that is evidence-backed. The service is always friendly. The weekends are pretty busy and if you don't join the waitlist you will end up waiting for 40+ minutes so I suggest calling in advance or ordering in."
,,,,,Thank you for sharing! We always love when folks have a good time at Snooze. We hope to sweep you off your feet again soon!
,,,,,Chain Breakfast/Brunch spot that is a local favorite.
,,,,,"This place was busy and packed, which is the norm especially for Sunday brunch."
,,,,,We had a party of 2.5 (10 month old) and placed out names on the waitlist 30 min prior to arriving. We were quoted a 45-60min wait time before we would be seated.
,,,,,This location has limited parking in their parking lot but plenty of street parking. 
,,,,,There is no standing or sitting room to wait for your table indoors. The space outdoors for waiting is limited.
,,,,,We were seated at a booth style table within the quoted wait time window.
,,,,,"I ordered the Palomamimosa, Sweet Potato Bacon Smash Up, and Signature Flight"
,,,,,"Paloma-Mimosa was advertised as a twist between a Paloma and a mimosa. It was grapefruit juice, tequila and Champagne. It was terrible. "
,,,,,The Paloma is one of my go-to mixed drinks and I love Mimosas (even outside of brunch) but something about this cocktail didn't sit right with me. The grapefruit juice didn't taste fresh and the tequila seemed as if it was watered down. There could've possibly been too much ice in my glass. 
,,,,,"The Sweet Potato Bacon Smash up was ordered for my daughter. This is a lot of food. The avocado was fresh, and eggs scrambled but still light and fluffy. The sweet potatoes were cooked perfectly. "
,,,,,The bacon bits were a bit too crispy too enjoy but I didn't feed those to my daughter.
,,,,,The Signature Flight was very tasty. I can normally only stomach about 2 pancakes at a time because of how rich the batter tends to be. 
,,,,,"I tried the Pineapple Upside Down pancake first and it was amazing. The flavors were light, not too sweet and the pancake batter itself seemed light like a crepe. "
,,,,,The Blueberry Danish was very sweet. I took a two bites to be sure and couldn't stomach the rest. 
,,,,,The Sweet Potato Pecan had an odd taste that I couldn't place but was improved with its paired maple syrup. 
,,,,,I finished the pineapple upside down pancake and ate half of the sweet potato one.
,,,,,I wasn't impressed with this restaurant enough to understand the hype. I would consider returning to try other menu items to-go but I wouldn't re-order any of the items from this meal or return to dine-in.
,,,,,"Hey there Kay, thank you for the feedback! We have passed it along to our team, and we hope to take your next experience from Okay to Amazing! We hope to see you again soon!"
,,,,,From food to service this place never disappoints! This is probably the most popular brunch spot in the area. It's always packed! I recommend getting in line and checking in while you are on the way. The wait is almost always about an hour. It is worth it though! 
,,,,,"I usually get the pancakes but I decided to get the Benedict duo this time and OMG so good! I got the avocado smash and the habanero pork belly. Both were amazing but the habanero pork belly was out of this world good. Out of all the plates on the table, absolutely nothing looked short of amazing. We also tried pineapple, orange and grapefruit mimosas. All great! I was sad they do not sell carafes though :( "
,,,,,"Our sever was awesome as well, I wish I could  remember her name. She was fast, friendly, and always kept checking on our table promptly despite how busy she was. Overall this was a 10/10 experience."
,,,,,Wow! We love to hear that you had a great time at Snooze! Thank you so much for your feedback. Come see us again soon!
,,,,,This is tough. I gave 3 stars because overall the food is honestly fire but it is my duty as a single bro to let fellow SB's know that this place is crawling with couples. Not dope. Lost my appetite feeling out of place (lonely). I thought my waitress was single at first because I thought she was into me but she wasn't. Obviously never coming back here when dennys full of single babes. Not Vance approved. Also this me looking fly.
,,,,,Awesome food and creative boozy menu options.  Brunch dishes are extremely generous - you won't leave hungry. 
,,,,,Be sure to Uber !
,,,,,Thank you for sharing! We always love when folks have a good time at Snooze. We hope to sweep you off your feet again soon!
,,,,,"We went on Monday so there was no line, it wasn't overly crowded, and service was good. I enjoyed my food and was satisfied. I don't know if it was waiting line good? But I don't know many things that are lol cute atmosphere for an easy breakfast. They also offer outside seating"
,,,,,Thank you for sharing! We always love when folks have a good time at Snooze. We hope to sweep you off your feet again soon!
,,,,,"Okay, this is going to be a difficult review. I use to LOVE eating here back in high school, and would gladly wait an hour to get seated. "
,,,,,"I wanted to get brunch today and we decided on here, since I haven't been in years. We got seated right away and the hostess was super nice! I will say we were waiting awhile for our drinks to come out, and we really wanted to drink them before we got our food. So we let our food sit for maybe 30+ minutes before we got our drinks. It was busy, but it was inconvenient. "
,,,,,"Food was great, the pancakes were a lot heavier than I remember but still very enjoyable! I will say the egg that I got for like 2 or 3 dollars I believe was very small. I really don't think it should be that small for the price. The mimosas we got were also warm and we ended up not finishing them."
,,,,,"I think I'd have to come again and try it, because I do love this place! The food wasn't bad so I'll definitely be back in the future."
,,,,,1706 Westheimer Rd
,,,,,"Houston, TX 77098"
,,,,,I don't know why it took me forever to try this bakery out but I finally made it. I came in just to pick up some sweets aka  perfect bite size macaroons for my office. I picked up an order of 28 total. Now I wish I would of tried some of there food items but i had lunch already. I will say seeing what other people got the food did look amazing. Ok back to the macaroons they were good and fresh I will say that.
,,,,,"I finally got to go to the bakery, now that it is not impossible to get in lol. I ordered a cake for my husband's  birthday, the double chocolate. I went to pick it up, and I was excited to see other little treats that have to offer. Everything looked so good, especially the chocolate chip cookies, even though I was fasting, I was able to resist temptation, after we had a amazing cake to look forward to. I will need to return for those cookies, and the menu looks so delicious, I want to try everything, As for our cake, you can really tell the difference when quality ingredients are used. It was so good, it tasted like a hostess cupcake."
,,,,,Best. Place. Ever. 
,,,,,This is my go-to place. I eat here at least once or twice a week. My friends got my birthday cake made here and it was amazing! I have referred this place to many friends and they all loved it!
,,,,,"I very much enjoy the cute environment in this cafe/bakery. I absolutely LOVE their croissants, especially the pistachio one. Highly recommend that one as well as the almond one. I've also tried a few of the beautiful cakes/pastries, which were divine. Iced coffee is pretty good, too. Items here are a bit pricey, but I will definitely be going back."
,,,,,"It's been tough to find my ""go-to bakery"" spot in this city but the search is finally over! This place is devine! The cakes are not only beautiful, but they taste fabulous which is very uncommon. Those who have a sweet tooth know what I'm talking about. So far I've tried 3 of their cakes, their macaroons and chocolate chip cookie! All fantastic! "
,,,,,"I've ordered the lemon raspberry cake, chocolate raspberry, and strawberry champagne. Let's just say I can't decide which one is my favorite yet. "
,,,,,"I've also eaten here for lunch which is pretty nice. This spot is always crowded which tells you a lot about the quality of the food. If you haven't tried it, I'm not sure what you're waiting for!"
,,,,,"On a rainy day in downtown Houston, this place had the vibrancy and the atmosphere to raise the mood and our spirits up! As soon as you walk in, you are greeted by a beautiful assortment of amazing desserts and a friendly hello by the staff, the food very pleasant to look at! Drinking a warm and soothing cup of Lavender coffee right next to a window with racing raindrops: it's a whole vibe! My personal favorite treats were the Nutella croissant and the walnut chocolate chunk cookie! The atmosphere was super cozy and warm as it had a European flare to it with the charming dangling lightbulbs and the rustic wood tables, had a flashback when I was in downtown Stockholm, Sweden! If you are touring around Houston looking for a good coffee with a warm and inviting atmosphere, this is the place to go! Regardless if you're new to Houston or if you've lived here for years, this place is DEFINITELY worth a try! You won't be disappointed!"
,,,,,My husband surprised me with this beautiful birthday cake! This is the second cake we've gotten from Common Bond and they never disappoint! Tasted as good as it looked. Excellent customer service as always!
,,,,,Stopped by here before our flight for bfast today around 7am.  
,,,,,Biscuits & gravy with fried chicken-  I really liked their biscuits and that was pretty much it
,,,,,Chefs bfast scramble- it was also just ok
,,,,,"Kouign amann-I am super obsessed with these, so I was excited to try.  They were just ok.  My favorite is the ones from B patisserie from San Francisco.  "
,,,,,Choco cookie-this was actually my favorite.  
,,,,,"Overall, place is pricey, but just mediocre food."
,,,,,"Cute cafe with delicious desserts! Plenty of parking. We only stopped in for dessert and coffee, but I would definitely return to try some of their regular menu items."
,,,,,"Clean trendy place for a quick salad, breakfast, or whatever is on the menu.  Everything' is good and place is very comfortable. Make you want to just hang out till your next meal! Will go back"
,,,,,1706 Westheimer Rd
,,,,,"Houston, TX 77098"
,,,,,"I am usually a savory over sweets kinda gal but this place has me acting like it's opposite day! First thing's first, you will almost always have to wait in line - don't be discouraged it is worth the wait! "
,,,,,I will ALWAYS get the Kouign-Amann - it's like a croissant that was layered with sheets of sugar between the filo dough and then the outside achieves a shell that gives you the perfect amount of crunch when you take that first bite. The little cakes are also a delicious little snack. The flavors are not overpoweringly sweet and it looks like you can even get big cakes for your birthday or next big event. I saw the chef (or would it be baker?) sit down with a couple to help them pick out wedding cake flavors so that is also a feature they have.
,,,,,"Now for the brunch items. I came in with a friend looking for the same level of quality. Aside from an exceptional fluffiness in the scrambled eggs, they fell short of even lesser franchise brunch spots. Their hash/potato side was made in the form of a cube, mixing cheese and other ingredients together but it came out with too many flavors mixing and not any specific texture."
,,,,,This is my favorite restaurant in Houston! Their pastries are to die for and their entrees are so tasty. I have the hardest time selecting what I want because I just want to eat everything LOL. I've never tried anything here that I didn't like. 
,,,,,"On my most recent visit, I got an almond croissant, the Herb Crusted Lamb Chops, and the Beef Bourguignon. "
,,,,,"The almond croissant was perfect! It was so flaky, crispy, and not overly sweet. There is a ton of powdered sugar on the top but you can easily tap off the excess. There's a a bit of filling inside too! "
,,,,,The Herb Crusted Lamb Chops were divine. The potatoes and carrots are perfectly roasted and the sauce is amazing. 
,,,,,"The Beef Bourguignon has so much flavor as is surprisingly filling, but is a bit on the saltier side."
,,,,,I see why this place is so popular! It's insta-worthy and tasty.
,,,,,"Common Bond is a bakery in Montrose that serves up pastries and basic-sounding but not basic-tasting cafe foods (salads, soups, sandwiches, etc.) The interior is light and airy with tons of space to study inside with outlets or chill on the al fresco patio with friends."
,,,,,"You order cafeteria-style so you have to walk past ALL the freaking pastries before paying the cashier at the end. I walked inside with the intent of buying one pistachio croissant pastry but ended up also ordering a goat cheese and beet salad and an almond croissant for tomorrow morning.  No regrets, though. "
,,,,,"The pistachio croissant is the most recommended item. It has a pretty green swirl through it so it looks really good on photos. The first bite was delicious- slightly nutty and pistachio-y with a sweet kick. However, the marginal utility of each subsequent bite diminished faster than most readers' tolerance for my nerdy jokes. Moving on! By the time I got halfway through the pastry, the croissant tasted overwhelmingly sweet. So I recommend splitting one with a friend. "
,,,,,"The beet and goat cheese salad was money! I thought it was possibly the best beet and goat cheese salad of my life. They had three types of beets (red, golden and the swirly kind,) leafy sprouts, crushed pistachios, soft goat cheese, crispy croissantinis, and a sweet balsamic drizzle. To top it a off, they sprinkled a spice of some sort all over and it just MADE the dish! It tasted like five spice or cinnamon or cloves. It was sooo good."
,,,,,The almond croissant was also so good! Almond croissants are my go-to pastry but only if they have almond paste inside. This one has almond paste. The croissant was crispy on the outside but fluffy and soft inside. The almond paste was sweetened just enough and it wasn't cloyingly sweet like the pistachio one.
,,,,,"I really enjoyed Common Bond and I wish they would come to Los Angeles- I know they would do very well.  If you find yourself in Houston, definitely make a stop here. I recommend getting the beet and got cheese salad and the almond croissant."
,,,,,"The Brussel sprouts are amazing. Hands down. The best we've ever had!!! Go there now and order them!! Topped with Honey balsamic glaze with caramelized onion (we left the pancetta off), these were fresh and so delicious! The Poutine fries are really good, as is the French onion soup. We also ordered a vanilla latte with Oat Milk, and it was smooth, refreshing and perfect. The walnut chocolate chip cookie was decent, but probably wouldn't order that again. Overall, it's definitely worth the trip. The fresh baked breads looked great also."
,,,,,"Eh, this place is just ok. We came on a Sunday morning and were surprised to find a spot in the very small lot next to the building but we're not surprised that the line extended beyond the inside. It did move quickly, we were able to order within about 10 minutes. "
,,,,,We got the chocolate chip walnut cookies based on reviews. I haven't eaten mine yet but my SO reports that it's just a regular cookie. No better than just grabbing one at Whole Foods.
,,,,,"For breakfast  I had the French toast which looked really pretty but didn't do it for me taste wise. I liked that the bread used for it was really thick, but they cooked it too long which made it difficult to eat. He had the Shrimp and Grits which he reports as just regular, nothing special. "
,,,,,Meh. We might come back one day but we're not dying to do so or making a special trip for it again.
,,,,,"Every meal I have ever had from Common Bond has been great. I recommend the French dip or grilled cheese sandwich. You can't go wrong with their tomato soup either. Also, their eggs Benedict and brunch meals are solid. The location is a bit difficult to find parking, but better right now to get meals delivered or curbside."
,,,,,"I have had coffee and pastries here. I do not come back for the coffee, but I absolutely come back for the pastries. I got a vanilla latte, which was good not great. However, I love their baked goods. I haven't tried all of them (is this even possible?), but the ones I've tried I have loved. The oatmeal cream pies are a particular favorite of mine, but the Nutella croissant is good too. Common Bond also serves a cooked breakfast, but I have never had it. "
,,,,,"The cafe had always been clean when I went and the staff super friendly and helpful. There is a lot of indoor seating (seat yourself) and outdoor seating. Their display of breads, cakes, and baked goods will make your mouth water for sure. "
,,,,,"It is conveniently located on the corner of Westheimer and Dunlavy and has a small lot next to it. That fills quickly, as it is shared with the rest of the shopping center. A block or so north, there is a larger lot for just Common Bond customers. You can also park on the street."
,,,,,"If you tryna come here for brunch on a Saturday or Sunday like I did, good luck... it is packed-and for good reason!  My friend and I quickly got in line and started to look at the menu and drool over the fresh pastries on display.  That pistachio croissant looked so freaking good, I knew I had to order one.  In addition to that, I also ordered a croque madame and a latte for dine-in.  After paying, the cashier handed me a number for my order and as I began to look around the room, I got scared that we wouldn't be able to find a seat.  However, an employee gestured me over and said that there was a table so phew!!!"
,,,,,"My latte came out first and was the right combination of milky and bitter.  Drinking a nice, hot latte feels like getting a hug on the inside... the hot coffee and warm milk travel down my throat and just warm me up from the inside out!  Once the croque madame arrived, I started to dig in and was pleasantly surprised at how delectable it was!  The bread was soft and warm, the ham salty and sweet, the cheese perfectly melted and had a slight hint of jalapeño flavour to it... just overall scrumptious.  The small cornichons accompanying it was a nice complement as well!  There was a fried egg on top (which makes it a ""madame"" instead of a ""monsieur"" ) which could have been a little more runny than what I got, but whatever-still enjoyed it all the same."
,,,,,"P.S. Parking here can be a bit difficult, but they have two parking lots.  One right next to the establishment itself and another one a little further down if you just keep driving.  Both don't have that many spots, though.  Due to this reason, I would try to come at off-peak hours."
,,,,,I mean this place's reputation precedes it.  Great pastries and baked goods.  Staple of Houston.  Kouign Amann is one of their well known buttery multilayered cake.
,,,,,Everything is fresh.  Idk why you're reading this if you're debating whether to go.  Just go already!
,,,,,"I liked this place. The pastries were really good.  I came in on a Sunday around 230 pm and there was really no line.  I actually like the set up, as you can buy with your eyes first.  We ordered the pistachio croissant, the almond croissant and a few other pastries.  "
,,,,,"The restaurant was a little dirty, some tables had not been thoroughly cleaned, but it was busy."
,,,,,"I wish the pastries we choose to eat at the restaurant would've been warmed up?  Maybe I'm alone on that.   All the pastries, baked goods did look delicious. "
,,,,,I'l definitely try it again if I'm in the area.
,,,,,1706 Westheimer Rd
,,,,,"Houston, TX 77098"
,,,,,"My friend and I love going here, the pastries are delicious and so beautiful! Cerulean is super friendly and helpful in making suggestions when we are overwhelmed by all the yummy options. :)"
,,,,,"Do I want a delicious, melt in my mouth croissant with a flat white or the turkey sandwich or the flatbread? The point is I can't choose because all are so delicious. If you are looking for a filling, legitimately tasty sandwich, do the turkey club. You won't be disappointed. I sub the white bread for multigrain and ask for spicy mustard but the quality ya the turkey, bacon, avocado and bread make the perfect lunch for me. Common bond has a ton of options and the best part is that I can take a loaf home for the rest of the week."
,,,,,"The pistachio croissant was screaming my name when I stumbled across this place on Yelp. Common Bond has been in my bookmarks for way too long. So of course, I was beyond excited when we just happened to be in Montrose and decided to stop by after getting coffee next door at Agora. "
,,,,,"Beware that parking is almost nonexistence. They have a small lot in the front but don't count on it. This place is always packed! Your next best bet is street parking. When we walked in, the line was almost out the door. However, it wasn't too bad and it moved quickly. They have every goodies imaginable. "
,,,,,"As you go through the line, just point out what you want from the display. They will give it to you on the spot. They have a variety of desserts. A-must is the chocolate chip cookie and the pistachio croissant. The cookies are super chunky with bits of walnuts inside. I love the pistachio fillings inside. Just the right amount of sweetness. The blueberry cheesecake is also a-must with its rich flavors. "
,,,,,"There was a few cakes on display, ready to buy. The cakes were beautifully decorated, one of them was a unicorn theme. Great choice for a birthday cake. They also serve lunch and dinner here with coffee and lattes. Water and utensils can be found by the windows. They have a good amount of tables to sit. Overall, I'm loving the baked goods and desserts here. An ideal place for breakfast or brunch."
,,,,,"Open for dine in but everyone is required to wear a mask prior to entering the bakery. The fruit tart crust was crisp, not too sweet. I had the mascarpone pastry which is a wonderful combination of brownie, chocolate mouse and mascarpone with a touch of espresso....amazing pastry! The Father's Day special, ""the mustache"" pastry is a chocolate mouse, too sweet for me."
,,,,,"Cute, popular bakery with outside seating. Nice croissants! Recommend! Especially for weekend breakfast."
,,,,,"Not an easy place to find seats. It feels like a high scale Starbucks, but people are oblivious. Instead of sitting down to have a meal and move on they dwell and discuss work. If you have business to discuss do it in an office setting not in a place where others may be waiting to have a meal. "
,,,,,I know it is not fair for the establishment to receive a less than perfect score due to the actions of inconsiderate people. I suggest management post some signs inside that states to make seats available once your done with your meal in consideration of others.
,,,,,Also plan your business to not run out of food. Something as simple as French toast is not something you should run out of.  Please plan accordingly.
,,,,,"Other than that the food and the drinks are top notch. I recommend the morning bun and avocado toast. I wish I could've recommended the French toast, but I wasn't able to try it."
,,,,,"Favorite bakery in Houston thus far!  The morning bun is probably my favorite.  A lot of their pastries are not overly sweet and very moist.  I haven't tried much of their other food yet, but it all looks very delicious!  My go to bakery especially at night when the baked goods are 50% off!"
,,,,,Corona menu 2020. Everyone is wearing masks and there is hand sanitizer at the door. Food is soso
,,,,,"Ok. First the cafe. If you love eggs this is a must visit location. Eggs on the burger cooked to perfection. The Tamale Benedict... oh yes. And you're welcome. The Beef and Grits, mmhm, grab that too. "
,,,,,"Now the pastries. On Mother's Day my husband and sons bought me the Unicorn Cake. The cake itself is tender and the sweetness is perfect. The frosting on the other hand. You remember the movie with Wreck it Ralph and the game Sugar Rush? The frosting was all that  Venelope or Penelope Von Sweets could wish for. So, if you to feel the sugar crystals in your buttercream then is particular cake is for you."
,,,,,"The cake is BEAUTIFUL, the frosting just was too much for me. "
,,,,,We also bought the Blackforest cheesecake and the Stawberry passion flourless goodness. 
,,,,,Try EVERYTHING! you won't regret the visit.
,,,,,Went here for brunch and would definitely go back! We ordered the lox tartine and chef's scramble and ate every bite. Only downside was our coffee orders were wrong but they were super busy on a Sunday morning. They keep the tables distanced and it seemed pretty clean.
,,,,,1706 Westheimer Rd
,,,,,"Houston, TX 77098"
,,,,,"I've only had pastries and their avocado toast here and they were all pretty good though pricey. For example, I love their pistachio croissant but it's $4.50 (seriously?! as much as I love it, I've had better croissants elsewhere for much much cheaper). It's also super crowded inside and service is pretty much nonexistent. After my first trip here, I thought I would come here so much more often but now I don't come here unless I'm really craving their pastries."
,,,,,"What a fun place to go! Definitely recommend for the younger crowd as the music is loud and there is a bunch of movement throughout the restaurant. When you arrive at Common Bond you walk past all the pastries, it's impossible to go without ordering one before arriving at the register to order. The restaurant is a seat yourself kind of place. There is a good amount of seating for the amount of space they have, you can sit inside or outside, but I wish they had more tables. When I was in line I was afraid we would order and we would have no where to sit! That's also a great thing as it shows it's a popular place. We ordered a chocolate croissant, it was the perfect amount of flake and butter to match the chocolate filling! I had the avocado and bacon toast. I felt as if I was eating at a farm to plate restaurant as everything on the toast was so fresh! I was a little underwhelmed with the poached egg, it looked poached on top but on the bottom it looked as if it was fried. We also tried the sausage and egg sandwich, let me tell you one word, WOW!! The entire thing was delicious from the buns all the way to the cheese. They have nailed their sausage recipe, the flavors burst with every bite, I could've eaten it all day. They also did not skimp out on the sausage either. I was expecting a thin piece of sausage but it was dense but not too dense where it over powered the entire sandwich. We will definitely be coming back and I will be ordering the sausage and egg sandwich!!"
,,,,,For those who don't know Common Bond offers an assortment of breads that are sold at local Whole Foods locations so now you can enjoy this local favorite at your local grocery store! 
,,,,,"Common Bond is by no means a cheap alternative - a couple pastries here can easily cost you $20 bucks. However, given 1) the excellent execution of appearance/decoration 2) the interesting flavors/combinations 3) stellar atmosphere I believe they're worth the money. "
,,,,,"Adjacent to Agora in the heart of 'omg where should I park?' land, Common Bond offers its own parking lot. It's almost always full, though. (What did you expect?) Fortunately next to a residential area with plenty of nearby parking if you're willing to walk far enough. "
,,,,,"A relatively spacious rectangular-shaped patio seating area. Cool, chic, modern indoor area that's clean and spacious. Self serve water, utensils, napkins, etc. "
,,,,,"Once you walk in, there's a dessert/bread display case on the right. This is where the waiting line is. You order at the end of the counter [some assortment of drinks offered] At the end, to your left will be a coffee bar to supplement your dessert addiction."
,,,,,Where do I even begin?
,,,,,Common Bond is the best place in:
,,,,,1. definitely Houston
,,,,,2. probably America
,,,,,3. maybe the Universe
,,,,,"Their laminated pastry (croissants, kouign amann) are incredible."
,,,,,Scones - I don't even like scones buy I love theirs.
,,,,,Everything is executed beautifully and balanced.
,,,,,They need to make a special category for yelp reviews that are on a totally different scale.
,,,,,It's like in The 5th element when they realize Lilu has totally different DNA and is a superior being to all humans.
,,,,,There are restaurants (everything else on Yelp) and then there is Common Bond.
,,,,,I was gifted some delicious cookies and some cupcakes O M G was this to die for. Everything I have tried has been wonderful. Definitely going back!
,,,,,Cool place. Good desserts too. They want me to add more words in order to post this review so I guess this little sentence may have solved it. Yelp.....stop making people post more words than what they experienced. It literally is a cool place and all I had was desserts lol.
,,,,,This place is the worst place I've. Ever been too the most snobbish waitstaff especially the cashier I asked her for salt and pepper and she totally ignored me and the prices are ridiculous If you're a snob it's the pert place for you
,,,,,This place is my go to spot for Birthday desserts in a pinch! They are nicely priced and people absolutely love the high end look of the personal size dessert.
,,,,,"I finally made it to the infamous Common Bond! People always talk about this place as one of the best bakeries and a good study spot. Well I'm going to throw in my 10 cents and say that this is probably one of the worst study spots because it gets so crowded and loud. I've never not been here when there's a line out the door so yep. Unfortunately I've yet to try their entrees, so this is a dessert review. "
,,,,,LOVE the cookies!! By far their best dessert even though it seems to be their simplest. I've tried both their Triple Chocolate Brown Butter Cookie and Chocolate Chip Walnut Cookie and omg they're so delicious. It's the right amount of chewy center and slightly crunchy on the edges. It's not diabetes-inducing sweet but it definitely hits that sweet tooth. I'd venture to say that this is the best cookie I've had in Houston so far. 
,,,,,"Nutella croissant: Omg yum, the croissants here are pretty good! This pastry is drizzled with Nutella and is also stuffed with Nutella on the inside, which I actually think makes its too sweet. The croissant part is soft, flakey, and buttery though! I'm also a huge fan of the little round crunchy balls that are sprinkled on top of the Nutella drizzle. "
,,,,,"Strawberry passion: This was super aesthetic, and it's sweet/tart which I enjoy but I also think that these types of desserts are more for IG/looks than they are for actual enjoyment."
,,,,,"Boston Cream Kugelhopf: Okay... what is this? It looks like an upside down something with cream inside. I think this was one of my least favorites because the cream has a strange indescribable flavor to it, which is further complicated with the texture of ?raisins?."
,,,,,"Twas super hyped to check out this place, not just because of the numerous reviews and photos but also because it reminded me of my yelp days at home in CA. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad but it wasn't extraordinary like I hoped to experience. The photos did more justice than the food itself all in all."
,,,,,"With three of us there, one of us did the HRW offering and the other two of us just ordered off the regular menu. Definitely go during HRW if you get a chance - that ended up not only being a good deal but also impressed the most. As for me, I ordered the steak salad, which ended up being more of an Instagram photo than a culinary experience. The steak looked nicely cooked but some pieces were chewy. The salad was not ""gigantic"" in my opinion, like the employee helping us said. And it ended up being nothing special but greens with some radishes, tomatoes, blue cheese, and the steak. Not a bad salad but again, was expecting more."
,,,,,"As for dessert, we tried three different kinds since it was our first time here - the cheesecake, the flourless passionfruit strawberry cake, and a caramel chocolate eclair. The only one I thought was good was the cheesecake, as this was light, fluffy, and flaked apart like snow. The only thing, however, is that it needed some fresh blueberries paired with the ""maraschino"" blueberries or something crumbly to offset the entire smooth texture. As for the other two desserts, both seemed like they were sitting out. The chocolate eclair mousse was dense and had that slight gel like texture around the outside, and the strawberry passionfruit dessert fell flat and dry. In fact, the layers separated right when we cut through it."
,,,,,Hope to visit again though to explore other things on the menu.

,,,,,"I've been to common bond about ten times and I like the open atmosphere but fair warning, it gets crowded, loud, and cold in here."
,,,,,"I really enjoy the coffee and pastries. I usually get a cappuccino and kugelhopf. I've tried their food and breakfast and wasn't impressed either times, especially for the prices. I would not recommend the lavender cappuccino, it was too fragrant and artificial."
,,,,,The cakes and macarons in the display cases are gorgeous and the French baguettes are perfectly crunchy and chewy.
,,,,,"Hi Samantha! Thank you for the review and feedback. We are so sorry you have not been satisfied with our entrees. We hope you will chose to try a few more items, we know you will find something you love!"
,,,,,"Sweet mother of pearl! Bookmark it, bookmark it NOW!!! Yes, 5 STARS! There was nothing-- not one single thing-- that I ate or drank that I couldn't rant and/or rave about! "
,,,,,"Seriously, this place is the TRUTH! Obviously the secret's out, but I was thrilled to find that the hype is real and the food and beverage can hold its own-- easily! "
,,,,,"The vanilla latte is arguably the best I've EVER had-- yep, I said it and I meant it! The scramble was EPIC! Their freakin' macarons-- good Lord! The biscuit was flaky and wonderfully made, and the preserve accompaniment was delicious and worth the honorable mention. The hubs had a beef, pot roast-ish deal that was divine but I was so locked in on my food that I didn't have the focus nor determination to skim off of his. He thanked me later! "
,,,,,"Warning: I do believe that the staff could possibly be a band of robots. Everyone I came in contact with was fully engaged and uber kind. Their customer service was way too seamless-- I mean, who's training these people? Someone should look into that! "
,,,,,"I kid you not... while I always want to love what (and where) I eat, I haven't been THIS excited about a dining experience in a while. Thanks Common Bond, you made my millennium and lucky for you, I'm not a local. Otherwise, I'd totally be the Dutchess! ;0)"
,,,,,"Ordered French Toast. The bacon was great; the fruit was tasty; the whipped butter perfect. The bread was heavy, dry, impossible to cut, need some liquid to be able to swallow. Compare with Sicilian Toast at Empire Cafe . That was a delight, this was a BAD breakfast! To add insult to injury, this item was way overpriced!"
,,,,,"Ordered the soft scrambled with applewood bacon with fresh baked baguette. The eggs were very flavorful. I had asked they be medium rather than soft. Perfect. Unfortunately the bacon was not completely cooked, certainly not crispy. The baguette was toasted and so good. If butter and jelly were included, would have been five star! Will do again!!"
,,,,,"I've been wanting to come to common bond for years, but finally came here recently! I think the venue deserves the credit it gets! The line was kinda long, and I saw I could place the order online, but I really wanted to see the whole line and pastry assortment. I got the ham and cheese sandwich, we got a few assorted pastries and croissants (best in the city in my opinion), and my wife got the egg scramble. We loved everything we got, and will definitely come by here again in the short future! The parking was a bit atrocious, the lot is TINY, literally enough spots to fill maybe a third of the restaurant, the rest is park at your own risk / run across the street if you're brave enough."
,,,,,"I keep hearing about common bond this and common bond that.  I had this bakery bookmarked and a few of us after attending a UYE decided to fulfill our craving for carbs.  The bakery was pretty busy and solid. I could not believe the amount of desserts (cakes, cookies, croissant, pastries etc) that were available.  "
,,,,,"They have a small parking lot adjacent with limited amount of parking spots.  Once the lot fills up, then basically your options are street parking in the neighborhood.  The line was long but steadily moving.  As you get closer to the counter to pay, you can point out to the employees of what you want from the display and they will mount the plate for you."
,,,,,"We ordered the pistachio croissant, black forest cheesecake, berry tart, a few cookies, and a slice of red velvet cake.  They actually have a nice selection of lunch and breakfast sandwiches available along with good salad selections. "
,,,,,"I did nibble from all our selections and if you have a sweet tooth, then you will definitely enjoy the carb treats."
,,,,,"Been here a couple times (once when visiting Houston and once after moving here) and loved it! Staff is always friendly and willing to help. I've tried their strawberry macaron, almond croissant, and chocolate walnut cookie. All super delicious and perfect for snacks or dessert. Most people come here and order their pastries to-go as the tables are for dine-in only. Will definitely be going back to try their pistachio croissant."
,,,,,"Oh man some good eats. Nice pastries and Brussels sprouts are amazing. Some pretty good coffee. Not silly, but pretty dang good."
,,,,,The staff here is extremely kind every time I have come in. I have come in separate occasions all for take out but if it wasn't for Covid-19 I would be dining in because the ambiance feels right and not rushed. 
,,,,,"I picked up the ""dad"" shaped fathers day cake (pistachio and berry pate)...It was delicious but it was very small for the price.  I also got four chocolate chip walnut cookies and my goodness these cookies are delicious, rich, thicccccc, and hearty.  "
,,,,,"I also ordered the common bond burger, it was a regular burger, not much flavor...it could definitely use an aioli of some sort.  Maybe I just like a little extra, and if you do too...this is not the burger for you, stick with the baked goods. "
,,,,,"Though I hate to admit it, Common Bond is the place I go to to pick up a last minute birthday treat for a friend who's birthday I seem to always forget.  It is within my budget and also, the presentation of these baked goods make them look like the dessert table at a royal wedding. "
,,,,,"Overall, splurge on a sugar rush and skip the burger."
,,,,,"If I could only pick one restaurant in Houston I could eat at for the rest of my life, it may very well be this amazing haven of sweets and savories. As a bakery, their baked goods are without a doubt the freshest and most delicious. I'll make the drive every day from sugar land to get my hands on those perfectly baked pistachio croissants. The Kouign Amann is a flakey ball of buttery dreams. And their cookies - omg buy them all especially if they're fresh out of the oven. I want to try everything else but those three things take my heart (stomach) every time. "
,,,,,Their brunch menu is so. Damn. GOOD. Breakfast sandwich is packed with meaty flavor. The tamale Benedict is the best Tex mex breakfast I've ever had. The cheese they use in the croque madame makes takes this sandwich to the next level. 
,,,,,"Their dinner menu! Holy cannoli, this was one of the best menus I've had during HRW and I need to come back for more dinner time here. Their soup was on point and the scallops. Man the scallops were good."
,,,,,Guess I better make some plans to cover some of my call shift tonight because I'm gonna need my common bond fix after writing this review.
,,,,,"The French toast is very very good. Not too sweet. The burger is so juicy and flavorful. My favorite dish, though is the brussel sprouts dish. The bacon is cubed but thick and the onions are a little sweet. The brussel sprouts are not overcooked and still crunchy. It's so good. I also had a chocolate chip cookie which was great. I've been here twice and the service is always impeccable. They're fast and very nice. The iced chai latte is also good. Lots of cinnamon. And it's a beautiful establishment full of light because of the large windows."

,,,,,"This is such a cute bakery/cafe! My cousin and I decided to try here for lunch. Parking is limited in the back of the cafe so you may have to park in the neighborhood where it is a parking zone. I didn't get the baked goods this time, but I tried their lunch menu.  Luckily, it wasn't too packed and was able to find an indoor table after ordering our food. I got the Beef Bourguignon while my cousin got the Hot and Crunchy Salmon, and we also the Latte coffee. "
,,,,,"Beef Bourguignon: 5/5 - It may seem little, but it was filling for me. The dish was flavorful, and the meat was tender. I appreciate the in house-made baguette to go along with the stew dish. "
,,,,,Latte coffee: 5/5 - You know they grind fresh coffee beans to make the drink. The latte has a good aroma!
,,,,,"Overall, the staff are all super friendly. The food is made from high-quality ingredients. I enjoyed my meal. I would like to be back to try their baked goods, food, and other drinks!"
,,,,,"Every time is a fun time here at Common Bond! The people are friendly and really help you out with choosing something from the menu! The food is always delicious, and we try to get something new each time! "
,,,,,Don't get me started on the amazing pastries- oh my gosh imagine a fresh warm chocolate Nutella Melting in your mouth with each bite  Just reminds you of how good life is! Everything is made fresh- from the savory juicy soups to the crispy hot French fries  
,,,,,"The pricing is a little high but other than that, love this place!"
,,,,,"Best little bakery in Houston!! Common Bond has the eye candy angle down pat. On our way through town, our family grabbed a number of pastries for our upcoming vacation.  Every single one was delicious...the pistachio croissant, chocolate chip cookie, Boston cream kugelhopf, and the macarons. I take that back. One of the macarons was stale, and they replaced it for me once I brought it to their attention. I was seriously considering hitting Common Bond on our way back from vacation! Sadly, didn't get to. "
,,,,,"We brought our two year old and 6 month old baby with us for a short cup of coffee. The other guests seemed pretty open to them and there were other young children at the bakery as well, although I wouldn't consider this a kid friendly place, but it worked for us. The inside of the bakery is so jammed with tables (due to their popularity I'm sure) that there wasn't space for us to maneuver our extremely small, nimble stroller. But I would absolutely come back anytime I can."
,,,,,"Oh my goodness! This place was delicious. We came here on a recommendation. Brunch on a Saturday for 3 people and a baby. The line was long, but moved at a good pace. Be prepared to have some patience. The parking lot was pretty full (naturally) so be prepared to have patience here as well. But, once you're in, that's when it all becomes worth it!"
,,,,,"You walk past all their delicious baked goods on the way to ordering your breakfast. We ordered just about everything. Cookies, cakes, doughnuts, croissants, croissants with marzipan, chocolate, lemon, etc. You get the idea. We ate it all (felt fantastic) and it was delicious! They are also known for their pies but that will need to be for our next visit."
,,,,,"Now let's move to brunch. French toast, a specialty eggs Benedict, pancakes, another egg dish, etc. Also all delicious but they had small twists. A different ingredient, or different way of preparing it, for instance my eggs Benedict was over a tamale with a red sauce. The flavors all worked and it wasn't so exotic that you couldn't find anything to eat. "
,,,,,I would absolutely recommend coming here and hope to come by myself when I visit Houston next. Enjoy!
,,,,,"We were really looking forward to trying Common Bond but left a bit disappointed. We ordered two pastries to go upon arrival and those were good. We got an oatmeal creme pie and a chocolate chip cookie. We then proceeded to order lunch. A Texas sandwich and shrimp & grits. Overall we felt the food was subpar. But the worst experience we got came down to the service. We encountered 4 employees all in different roles. One who I got the impression was a supervisor and out of all 4 the only one who gave good, respectful service was the cashier (I wish we got his name to give him credit). Overall, not a great experience. Willing to come back and try breakfast entrees but we don't think it lived up to the reputation this place has on the internet."
,,,,,"I went to Common Bond solely for the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich && it turned out to be just as good as I had imagined!! I had to go all in with the Parmesan fries as well, I ended up stuffed but it was definitely worth it. We order two hibiscus mimosas, the server accidentally brought out mango. She graciously comped the mango && brought out the mimosas we had ordered. We had to take some goodies to go since we were already there. The Turtle Brownie && Mocha Mascarpone Tart were both cute and delicious. "
,,,,,The only downfall I can point out is the limited seating inside. There are plenty of tables but during lunch time there pretty much all taken. We were lucky to have spotted someone leaving. The patio would've been awful during the daytime because who wants to sit outside in this Houston heat!!
,,,,,"Cozy happy lil. Coffeeshop. Parking is scarce. But worth the trip! Their chocolate chip cookies are THE BEST cookies I have ever had! Not too sweet and the texture is just perfect. Also, they have the best birthday flavor macaroons. Everything I had there was really good. Service is great and the place is clean. I tried almost all their sweets and baked goodies - i like them all!"
,,,,,"We were looking for a place we've never been to before to try breakfast at in our neighborhood and we came across Common Bond Cafe & Bakery. It's such a cute spot. With an array of pastries to choose from, as well as different coffee drinks, there's also a full food menu. I wanted to be on the ""safe"" side and chose something that I knew wouldn't fail me and that was the French toast. Let me to tell, it was so good!!! They use challah bread, which is my favorite for French toast, it's served with some amazing tasting strawberries and bacon. I was pleased with my entire meal. They also have mimosas, which we had a carafe of mango mimosas. Definitely no complaints there lol!  Because who doesn't love mimosas! "
,,,,,"All in all, I can definitely say that we'll be back to try something different on the menu and to try some of their pastries!"
,,,,,"Common bond is great for pastries and coffee drinks! I love the macarons, cookies, and all of the pastries they offer! "
,,,,,One of the best things about common bond is that you can't get a lot of their desserts anywhere else in Houston and they all taste amazing! 
,,,,,They have the best lavender lattes as well! Coffee is super good! Great place to go with friends and for brunch or a quick coffe!
,,,,,"Baked goods are yummy, but service could be a bit friendly.  Just smile and it will go along way!"

,,,,,Went here with a friend after we got our noses pierced for a quick snack. Packed as usual. They have a small parking lot which we were able to find spots in. If. It street parking is available. Great experience!
,,,,,"We have never been to Common Bond Bistro & Bakery, but we were very excited to try it since the location seemed nice and the food looked delicious. However, the customer service left us not wanting to return as it was busy we were told to wait by a gentleman that may have been the manager on duty until it calmed down a bit and tables became available. However, after a few minutes were we told by another employee that it was okay to enter and we ordered our pastry. The same gentleman asked us who allowed us in and we explained. He once again informed us that there are no tables and we would have to wait. He did not state an estimated wait time nor that we had only the option to order for take out or eat outside in this hot Houston weather. Once it was our time to get to the register and order our main meal the cashier told finally informed us that we could only eat outside or to take out. We were disappointed to have waited nearly an hour to finally be informed of this. After poor communication with the staff and the customers we will not be attempting to try them which is such a shame."
,,,,,"This place is worth the wait! The line may be intimidating, but don't worry; it's there because people are choosing from a wide variety of delicious pastries before they order their entrè. "
,,,,,These guys know their dough. I loved their pastries and bread. It's as fresh as it can get! I ordered the Pork Tamale Benedict. It was beautifully plated and delicious! 
,,,,,The atmosphere and lighting in here makes this place great for a date or brunch with friends. There's even a back patio for you to sit outside and enjoy the Montrose vibes. 
,,,,,I'll be coming back!
,,,,,"Yes, Common Bond continues to offer the best Kouigan Aman I've ever had. I felt I owed it to you all to return for a triple-check and quality confirmation  This buttery, chewy pastry with layers of flavor rocks my world every time. I always find myself trying to scheme up ways to take a dozen home, freeze them, somehow not gain weight and celebrate their magic over and over again. Alas, I'll savor these few visits we have every year. "
,,,,,"If you're looking to tap into WiFi, note that it is available on weekdays on the patio and rumor has it they shut it off on the weekend which makes sense with their serious flow of hungry pastry fans filling through."
,,,,,Key takeaway: the line is worth the wait. Don't get your panties in a wod. Stick around and thank me later.
,,,,,"Today was our third visit to this pastry haven. Maybe fourth? Either way, I'm well overdue for a review. Today's particular visit stood out as their front patio offers patrons a dog friendly option. You mean I can devour your perfected pastries, lavender lattes, read my book in the sunshine and hang with my pup? Heaven! "
,,,,,"Get ready- I'm about to throw out a superlative--- Common Bond makes the best kouign amann I have EVER had. It is the perfect balance of flaky, buttery layers with a sugar coated crisp bottom. It would also qualify as one of the best pastries I've ever had in general. The cherry on top is the window on the side of the building where you can watch the magic happen behind the scenes. "
,,,,,"Order at the front counter and weave your way down the line of breads, cakes and pastries. Note that they also offer proper breakfast and lunch options like biscuits and gravy topped with over easy eggs. The lattes and cappuccinos are top notch. If you're planning to make holiday orders - be prepared to do so in advance. They pop up a tent and make a whole production of it. (This place is no secret, you guys)"
,,,,,Can't wait to swing by early Saturday morning and grab a few more pastries for the road home to Indiana.
,,,,,"Love this cute little place!  Whenever my hubs and I come, we always get a latte with some pastries.  Everything is always great and they have a wide variety of different pasties to try.  I wanted to swing by today, but didn't want to deal with the challenge of getting a parking spot.  That is itself can take 15+ minutes.  But that is a great thing for them, they stay busy.  "
,,,,,So my hubs mentioned that the other locations are not as busy as this one.  You can get in and out faster if that is what you are looking for.  
,,,,,This is def one of the places I will always go for my usual croissants and latte.
,,,,,"Love this spot, food is always good and service is on point. Since CoVid they have been on top of making sure customers abide by social distancing and face covering."
,,,,,"If you want to wow a crowd at a dinner gathering, order from Common Bond!! This is my go to for desserts and it's always a crowd pleaser. I order a variety of options online- pastries, cookies, macaroons. It's so easy and the food is absolutely delicious!! I pick up curbside. It's all very efficient. Great customer service. And the packaging is so pretty. Great presentation when meeting with friends."
,,,,,"My mom and I decided to finally try this place out on her birthday so we went for brunch. It's the kind of place where your order, choose an indoor or outdoor seating and they'll bring it out to you. "
,,,,,FOOD:
,,,,,"They had quite a lot of menu items than I expected but I went with the Nashville Hot and when I say Hot, I mean HOT. Sheesh. It was a pretty big sandwich. It was good but it was a bit more spicy than I would've liked but it had cole slaw in the sandwich so it kind of toned it down a tad. I wouldn't get it again though if we're being honest."
,,,,,The Parmesan fries were really good. 
,,,,,My mom ordered the quiche and she said it was pretty good too. 
,,,,,DRINKS/DESSERT:
,,,,,Wow. Probably some of the best I've ever had. That cinnamon vanilla latte was SO delicious. My mom said hers was so yummy!
,,,,,We ordered the chocolate turtle brownie and gingerbread cookie. Chocolate lovers this ones for you! Order it. Thank me later. 
,,,,,All in all a great experience and lovely atmosphere. I love that they had a coffee bar and self serve water dispenser. 
,,,,,Definitely will be back to try out other menu items.
,,,,,"Stopped with a few friends for Sunday brunch at Common Bond at 10am, and here was a huge line out the door; that's when I figured this place would be really good. "
,,,,,"When we entered, I was automatically tempted by the giant pastries; the croissants just looked like they could each serve one person! I hadn't gone for a pastry that day; I'd settled for Beef and Grits and a drip coffee. My friends tried the French Toast and Bacon and Egg Flatbread. "
,,,,,"My meal was definitely very hearty; I was served a generous amount of fall-apart beef roast with cheese grits (the only way to eat grits, obvi). It was 10/10 morning comfort food. "
,,,,,"My friend said the French Toast was a little on the sweet side, as she couldn't finish it in one sitting. It looked absolutely delicious though. The flatbread was also a very substantial meal for a Sunday morning. "
,,,,,"The service was actually pretty fast; we'd been in line at 10am, but had our food by 10:30. Also, drip coffee refills are a thing here. "
,,,,,"The staff was very friendly, and I really look forward to coming back to Common Bond!"
,,,,,"I got the French dip Sandwhich and it was dry, it had a very weird smell to the meat. When trying to sit at a table the employee stopped us from sitting and there were customers fighting over tables. While the employees job is to calm the customers she walked off and was very unprofessional."

,,,,,"Houston, TX 77098"
,,,,,Really terrible day at Common Bond yesterday. I would give one star but there was one vigilant employee who sort of swooped in and got business taken care of. 
,,,,,"We came in for to-go coffee at almost 3:00. There were TWELVE visible employees - only one of which was on a register. Inconsistently, might I add. You had to wait in the pastry line to order coffee. My companion, realizing that no one in the pastry line was eager to get anyone in or out quickly tried to let the coffee bar guys know our order so it would be ready faster. They said we had to wait in the line for the register. There were only two parties ahead of us but it still took TWENTY TWO MINUTES for us to get to the register and get served. 22 minutes. For to-go coffee. Employees were doing phone orders, standing around, making sure no one was too close together but not serving people or getting anyone in and out. "
,,,,,There was finally one little guy who could see our heads were about to explode who saved the day. Unfortunately he got the brunt of our frustration. 
,,,,,When the coffee costs as much as it does at Common Bond not being served when there is barely a line and you can visibly see TWELVE EMPLOYEES is 100% unacceptable. If my support staff allowed this I would fire em all!
,,,,,"The salmon is amazing, sweets are delicious, coffee is strong, and pretty rad dude name Tristan working there always super helpful"
,,,,,I love coming here for a fancy croissant or a quiche. They have a wonderful breakfast selection and lots of desserts. My new favorite thing is their mushroom flatbread pizza! SO GOOD i could eat it every day! Service is always on point.
,,,,,The mocha was really good. The coffee taste strong and the oat milk didn't water down the coffee at all.
,,,,,"I got the daily board selection, which included baguette, sunflower rye and multigrain. Not such a huge fan of the baguette; I much prefer seeded/multigrain bread. The sunflower rye and multigrain (has poppy seeds) were really filling. The board came with jam, cream cheese and butter. The jam was too sweet for me. I think it would be nice if they offered different types of jam. I thought the breads tasted good but there wasn't anything too special about it. "
,,,,,"The soft scramble was good and had spring onions on top. It went well with the baguette. Personally, I wish there were more breakfast options, or at least vegetarian/vegan options. "
,,,,,"They have a wide selection of pastries. A lot of people ordered their croissants. I got the pear and earl grey scone, which is massive. I also got the mocha mascarpone tart. Their pastries look very decadent and I think it's what they're mostly known for. A great place to grab coffee and a pastry!"
,,,,,The food from this place is exceptional. From their soft scrambled eggs to their avocado toast. The freshest ingredients and the perfect balance of flavors. Anytime I'm in Houston this is a must have!
,,,,,"Best kouign amanns in Houston, hands down. What are kouign amanns? A buttery. flakey croissant-like pastry with a caramel bottom. Common Bond has these on display caramel-side up. Actually, I'm not sure where else one goes to get kouign amanns in Houston, but I don't need to know! I've had the kouign amanns as Dominique Ansel's in NYC, and Common Bond can stand their own."
,,,,,"You get in line, order pastries, pick out patisseries, and then order drinks and/or savory food at the register. They hand you the pastries right away, and if you ordered a coffee or food, they'll bring it out to you. "
,,,,,"Their chocolate walnut cookie is fantastic - gooey, chewy, and very tall. After the pastries, they also serve various patisseries and cakes. I've also tried some items from their savory menu - the duck ragout was delicious!"
,,,,,"It does get pretty busy, and popular items will run out. There are close-range tables inside and some tables on a little patio outside. The location is pretty crowded - solid for grabbing breakfast and having casual chats, but not the kind of place to sit for a long time or study. I think this is what Common Bond intends, anyway, not really a complaint! Every spot has to pick a vibe, and Common Bond is a bustling pastry shop."
,,,,,"Been wanting to come here since forever, but with all these bakeries in town I finally got around to coming here. The only reason really was because of the patio where I could bring my dogs. It is a nice place to bring your dog out. The food compared to others i would say beyond the looks the taste was just ok. Nothing caught my attention although they were all beautiful to look at. My pistachio crossaint did taste very good. The inside had some type of pistachio almondlike filling. The seasonal item i think was the stollen bread was good too. Overall not bad, but not one of my favorites"
,,,,,"I eat out 4x per week,  yet never give reviews.  However, today I am. I  went here for the 1st  time and my experience was terrible. I ordered the brunch special which was crawfish Benedict highlighted the screen as the brunch special. Strangely, the staff scrambled around and finally said they were out of crawfish. They said they had the tamales Benedict so I ordered that as it was something I had never tried. They brought the food to me after about a ten minute wait and the eggs and hollandaise sauce  were at best lukewarm...the  tamales were cold. I told the staff of my disappointment and they just looked at me with a bizarre look and said I'm sorry...My alternative?  A taquito from Whataburger. Just a horrible first time/last time experience."
,,,,,"I have been to Common Bond several times. It's in my neighborhood, and I really want to like it, but ... Today, it was very busy (Sat lunchtime), and I had to wait quite a while, but I stuck it out since people have said it is beter than it used to be. I got the Chef's Scramble and coffee, $25 for breakfast. The eggs were a bit overcooked. I thought they gave me a brownie which turned out to be a very over-browned hash brown square, and my usual favorite, the biscuits were over crisp and falling apart. I could not spread jam on them because they just crumbled when I tried. Everything tasted good, but was just so so for the price. I do love their croissants and fresh loaves of bread, especially the sprouted sourdough. Finally, though, they have a few more options for vegetarians, and that's a good change from their previous attitude of ""no substitutions."""
,,,,,They took almost 30 minutes in line to take our order. Very unfriendly when we got to the end of the line

,,,,,"We've always loved coming here.  The ambience & decor inside is very airy & light.  The food is always delicious!  We are currently under the stay-at-home order & although we mostly cook at home, we support a restaurant or 2 on the weekends & this one hit the spot!  We ordered a breakfast sandwich, avocado toast, bread basket, & French toast for our kids.  Although it was takeout, the presentation was still gorgeous!  Can't wait to be able to dine out properly again!"
,,,,,"Great place for pastries!!! Boston crepe pastry was delicious and rich. Lunch was beet salad... huge with different color beets , great dressing. French toast, pimento cheese, tamales!  Everyone loved their lunch."
,,,,,Sorrowful about this place.  Coffee was ok but all the pastries were eh...at best...cookies...Kroger is better.  Always have had bread from common bond but now I know-don't stray.  Oh and my KUGELHOPF was dry like an day old Fiesta donut.
,,,,,Super cute cafe! Finally a place that makes a good cappuccino and actually knows what breve means! This is a very special place in Houston Texas.
,,,,,Such a good place!! Everything on the menu looks amazing and the pastries look so good! I would recommend this place to anyone and would for sure come back!
,,,,,"I was in love with Common Bond for many years , unfortunately, yesterday was my last time at this location. Few things , price is ridiculous high, customer service not very friendly and slow and food was very stale ..."
,,,,,"I have been wanting to try this particular location for brunch for quite some time. Unfortunately my experience wasn't that great so I'm not sure I'll return. I have a lot on my mind and somehow didn't notice the line outside. After waiting for at least 10 or 15 minutes in the inside line and getting ready to check out, I had to ask for dine in as the cashier automatically chose to-go. "
,,,,,"Upon my request for dine in the cashier goes ""Did you wait in the line outside?"" to my shock and embarrassment. I let her know I didn't notice the line. She said she would have to ""check"" with the people outside to see if it's okay for me to have a seat, and to go wait at the bar. "
,,,,,"I walk to the bar and meet another worker who tells me I can't sit there. So at this point I was very confused. I told them that the cashier had asked me to sit there because I didn't realize there was a line. In a condescending tone this person says ""Yes, there is a line."" and motions for me to sit in a section that's really not for dining. Eventually I was allowed to have a corner table which was fine by me. Mind you there were open tables everywhere once that line died down. "
,,,,,"The situation just seemed like a big to do about nothing. While I understand there were people waiting, and it wasn't fair that I passed them, you can either seat me or you can't. Don't make such a big deal about it. "
,,,,,"All in all, the food was not worth the trouble. It was $10 for a sausage sandwich that was just okay truthfully. It wasn't the best overall restaurant experience."
,,,,,"Two of us visited on a Tuesday late morning. While you stand in line, all of their sweet and savory baked goods tempt you to the point you just want to try them all!  We decided on coffees, a pistachio croissant, a fig & goat cheese macaron, and the biscuits & gravy."
,,,,,"With the weather being sunny and around 70, we sat outside. The servers brought both the drinks and the food out to our table. "
,,,,,"The pistachio croissant was delicious! The color and glaze on it was beyond picture worthy. Then biting into it made me realize it doesn't just look good, it tastes amazing.  It was light, not too flaky, with pistachio filling on the inside that added a nice texture without letting you forget you are eating a croissant. "
,,,,,"The fig and goat cheese macaron was tasty as well, soft inside with a slight crisp when you bit into it. "
,,,,,"The biscuits and gravy dish came with two biscuits, each topped with an egg. These were so good. The biscuits were dense and not crumbly. The gravy was very flavorful. Cutting into the eggs and letting the yolks run just increased the flavor! "
,,,,,"Overall, a very nice and clean bakery/cafe that I would definitely visit again."
,,,,,Sick coffee shop in montrose area!!located near all the other good spots on Westheimer 
,,,,,"Awesome staff. If you're new to Houston, this is one of the places you have to visit to chill out and recover. Great place"
,,,,,Saturday afternoon 1:15pm (12-15-18) and there's a line out the door!
,,,,,Line went fairly fast (15 minutes) 
,,,,,we got it all: 
,,,,,breakfast dessert kuglehopf and a scone. 
,,,,,"Hibiscus champagne, vanilla and a carmel latte, chicken Florentine flatbread, avocado toast (wish it was 2 pcs instead of 1) , and a chocolate marscapone tart. "
,,,,,I also bought some whole bean house blend coffee. 
,,,,,Fantastic food and baked goods. 
,,,,,Highly recommend. 
,,,,,Note: at 430pm place was still going strong. Says a lot

,,,,,The wait was not bad for a Sunday. The food was good really good however the coffee did not do to for me. The people were very nice.
,,,,,"Ordered the crawfish Benedict and french toast. The crawfish was amazing highly recommend, french toast was okay cannot really mess that up."
,,,,,"We dropped by with a party of 5. We got several pastries, coffees and soft scrambles. It was all great. Nothing left to improve on. From the strawberry preserves to the potatoes hash brown/ quiche everything was great. We will definitely try to make it back tomorrow morning. It's worth it."
,,,,,"I ordered the tomato and burrata sandwich and it was really good! The service was even better, David took care of us and he did an incredible job! Made us feel so at home and took care of us! Thanks David!"
,,,,,"Okay so this place is delicious. It was recommended by my sister who currently lives in Houston. From the flaky croissants to the savory dishes. I was in awe of the flavors in the flatbreads and the salad.. but I feel my favorite dish was the shrimp and grits and the red velvet croissant. Not too sweet... Just the perfect flavor. If your in the area definitely check this place out. My husband also chose to get a slice of there hot fresh baked bread and oh was it delicious . We added some of the goat cheese from the salad and it hit the spot.. for any bread lovers, I absolutely recommend it if your getting a salad."

If your in the area definitely check this place out. My husband also chose to get a slice of there fresh baked and oh was if delicious with some goat cheese. Topped off the amazing dishes we had.
,,,,,"The pastries and desserts are top tier, so in comparison, brunch here is decent. I'd say most of the entrees are pretty good (my go-to is the chef's scramble while the boyfriend's is the nashville hot chicken sandwich), but I'd pass on the tamales benedict -- lukewarm, tiny, the tamales tasted like they were just microwaved, and just very underwhelming especially considering it's like one of the most expensive items on the menu."
,,,,,"Basically, you're really missing out on the full experience if you limit yourself to just ordering an entree. The almond croissants are my FAVORITE. I wouldn't normally pay more than $3 for a croissant anywhere else but I find myself treating myself to one whenever I'm here. Haven't tried the cakes here but the mini desserts (I favor the ones with chocolate) have all been great."
,,,,,"While there is usually a line by 11am on a weekend, the line moves at a decent pace so I haven't really had to wait more than 20 min. Wouldn't recommend coming here with more than 4 people as the space is relatively small and compact. The parking lot isn't big but majority of the time I've had good luck/timing on my side. Otherwise, it's montrose -- you may have to park a couple blocks away, but the pastries are worth it."
,,,,,"Disappointed.  My almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and baguette were all stale.  They were all very soft like cotton textured on the exterior. It seems like the baked goods were just defrosted from the fridge. I have given common bond many opportunities to improve but it just seems to get worse and worse in quality. There is no longer the local feel from a local bakery."
,,,,,"I have been disappointed with my experience with the croissants at common bond. The almond and chocolate croissants have been stale and no longer crispy, airy, and flaky like it was originally.  I can no longer rave about these croissants. I believe the ingredients have been downgraded and yet we still pay a premium for an inferior quality. Please bring the ""original"" quality croissants back."
,,,,,Long line but worth the wait.  Staff were friendly.  Delicious olive and walnut bread.  Good baguettes.  Best almond croissants in town.
,,,,,Delicious delicious food but MOST definitely overpriced!! I mean you are paying for aesthetics but at the same time it gets way too crowded so it doesn't turn out to be so aesthetic overall. 
,,,,,Pastries are a must try. Their croissants and breads are delicious and worth paying a bit more for.
,,,,,Entrees are not as special but taste delicious nonethelesss and are very aesthetic.
,,,,,"Every time I try coming here, it is packed with people and I decide to just leave and go somewhere else. I just wish I could sit down and eat properly D': With that being said, I have had their desserts and they are delicious. I'm a big fan of the chocolate croissant and their macarons!! The macarons are large and stuffed with super flavorful ganache that actually matches the flavor of what the macaron should be. I just wish the bakery had more seating so that I can one day enjoy eating indoors. Will keep trying to come back to get a seat!!"
,,,,,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Houston. They have several locations, but the one on Westheimer is the best! The desserts are gorgeous, but they are OK.  I rather have savory than sweet!  I ordered the Tomato Basil Soup with a Grilled Cheese Sandwich and Poutine. Poutine is a Canadian dish with fries, gravy, and cheese curds."
,,,,,The tomato basil soup was full of flavor and goes perfectly with the sandwich! I really liked the bread they used for the sandwich because it had the perfect crunch while it was soft inside. It had the perfect amount of cheese for a fun cheese pull!
,,,,,"Poutine is one of my favorite dishes! We don't have a lot of restaurants serving poutine here in Houston. They added the perfect amount of gravy that it doesn't make the fries soggy. If you are a cheese lover, I suggest you try this dish!"
,,,,,The whole experience was 5 ! Pastries were perfection! The tamale brunch entree was remarkable!! We will definetely be returning !
,,,,,Best bread and pastries. They just get it right which is unfortunate for my waistline! Pricey though!

,,,,,"I've been to Common Bond several times to do work during the afternoon. I love the atmosphere at this bakery - large windows with lots of light, plenty of tables to work, and the wonderful smell of baked goods. I had only ordered tea and pastries before, but I finally went there for breakfast the other day. For a Wednesday morning, there were a lot of people around. It was about half full when I got there around 8, but it was pretty full by the time I left at 9."
,,,,,"Besides all of the beautiful pastries that you see while standing in line to order at the counter, they have several menu items to order. I got the chef's scramble - 3 eggs with daily ingredients (that day they had mushrooms, spinach, and cheese), potatoes, choice of sausage or bacon, and choice of biscuit or toast. Wow was it delicious, and a lot of food. Get this only if you are really hungry...I wish I had been hungry enough to finish it all! Would recommend getting the toast because it's a nice thick lightly toasted piece of bread. I don't like things overly toasted, so this was perfect for me. I will definitely come back to try more meals and more yummy looking desserts and pastries soon!"
,,,,,Great location and atmosphere. The Blackford cheesecake was so delicious with my Michael latte.      I will be back here.
,,,,,Looooooooved the almond croissant  everything was good but loved the croissant too much haha the lox tartine was tasty. It was just too big for me and i couldnt bring the rest home bec the smoked salmon wouldve gone bad. Latte was good too!
,,,,,I've always loved Common Bond's food and especially the pastries but I was very disappointed this time bc their cookie was undercooked. The person serving me was not very engaging so I asked for two of each flavor of Macarons but she left out one flavor that I really wanted so that was disappointing.
,,,,,Absolutely amazing. Best coffee in town IMO. I always try to shop local and what better service and team members than common bond. The barista also complimented my purse which of course heightened the experience. 10/10
,,,,,"My boyfriend and I came in on a Sunday afternoon. Parking is scarce. To drink we started off with some mimosas.  For our meals we ordered from the weekend brunch, they have a menu for the weekday as well. My boyfriend ordered the bacon and egg flatbread , it was delicious and crispy. It does have a red sauce that was semisweet but still a good pairing for the flatbread. I ended up getting the French toast which was very fluffy and sweet.  They had a wide variety of desserts, will try to come back to taste ! "
,,,,,Seating is also a scarcity on a Sunday early afternoon. We ended up seating on the patio to enjoy the beautiful day. They are a dog friendly patio.
,,,,,Overall the staff was friendly and the food was delicious. We will definitely come back!
,,,,,"Hands down my favorite place to get coffee in the city. The coffee and pastries are top notch, but also the Montrose location has a really great atmosphere. My favorites are the almond croissant and the Kouign-Amann (with butter and jam). "
,,,,,The hot food menu is surprisingly hearty--and tasty. I recommend the quiche loraine. The French toast is excellent (maybe order the maple syrup on the side). I've also enjoyed pork tamales and duck & white bean stew served with a baguette. All delicious. 
,,,,,Everything about Common Bond is five stars.
,,,,,"Nice, cozy cafe! I would recommend it for the overall environment and food. Lots of natural lighting."
,,,,,The food was pretty good. The only complaint I had was that my grilled cheese was a little on the burnt side. Their pastries were tasty- the chocolate chip walnut cookie and turtle brownie were my favorite.
,,,,,Very disappointed.  I am positive the chef is different. The entire experience was sub par compared to past experiences. So sad won't recommend nor will we return.  Kitchen needs help.  Over cooked yoke undercooked whites on croque madam.  French dip was basically mushrooms . French fries severed cold and never was approached by a wait person.  
,,,,,"At register given the choice of 25percent tip or more...really no service, oops, should have said no thank you.  My fault.  "
,,,,,What a shame used to be such a treat.
,,,,,************+
,,,,,We received a very respectful and concerned email from management.  We are very encouraged by the quick response.  Hope their future is bright.
,,,,,"First time at Common Bond, and I was impressed! My coworkers and I were doing community site visits and stopped her after lunch for a snack. They were raving about the sweet treats, so I was very excited to try them out. The restaurant has a nice ambience inside and it was very neat. I am excited to return so that I can experience some of the food and partake in the happy hour. "
,,,,,I ordered a chocolate chip/walnut cookie and it was very delicious warmed up. I loved the set up of the water station because it had everything you needed and you could return at your own convenience. The service was great as well. I will definitely return.

,,,,,"Houston, TX 77098"
,,,,,"We've been here several times and I would say I loved it on the past but and underwhelmed by them now. The staff member rang us up wrong and after I brought this up, he assured us it was the same price (it wasn't, there was a 25 cent difference but it's the principal.)he didn't know the menu and wasn't able to answer questions regarding the menu. Interior and ambience is cute but I don't think we will be going back anytime soon."
,,,,,"Cute little shop with ample lot and street parking. We stopped by on a Sunday around noon to order to go some brunch snacks to go. All employees that I saw were wearing masks correctly and they had someone at the door pacing the number of folks coming in and out. Jennifer at the pastry counter was cheery and helpful with information on what was available and her favorite picks. I ended up with a blueberry muffin that Castro so nicely got warmed up for me and a lavender latte with oat milk, that Jennifer recommended and the woman in front of me excitedly encouraged. The gentleman at the register suggested I get it iced and I have to say, my crowd sourced drink order was extremely tasty and not too sweet. Pop in, they've got warm and cold drinks and dishes for dine in (indoors or patio) or carry out along with a million sweets to tempt you."
,,,,,I want to update my review to another 5 stars. I want to thank the regional manager for his amazing customer service. I won't say what he necessarily did but he gives my daughter with a surprise for her up coming bday and was just so nice to her while I waited in line. He was so friendly snd the staff and service was the best like always. I drive all the way out here from Katy that's how much I love this place. The coffee desserts and food are just to die for. I'll never stop being a customer here.
,,,,,This place is SO GOOD! Very expensive but absolutely worth it. I recommend the coffee. My husband and I drive about 35 miles from home just to come here to get coffee and a pastry. The cookies are incredible and the breakfast is our favorite. There's no other place like this. I recommend giving them a try despite the prices. Will always be a regular customer!
,,,,,"Common Bond is an oldie but a goodie. Came by for breakfast with my kiddos and was super IMPRESSED by the spread. All of the pastries were beautiful and looked delicious. Their coffees are fantastic, too. "
,,,,,The inside of the cafe is bright and inviting. Service is quick and efficient. Can't wait to return to try the kouign aman. I loved the almond croissant and ham and cheese baguette I got!!
,,,,,I had a late start one day and decided to head over for some quality coffee. Common Bond always produces positive vibes and great coffee- just what I needed! Inside they have fewer tables to maintain distancing and keep everyone safe. I got a cappuccino and it was the perfect size and definitely delicious!! Head over to common bond and check out their delicious coffee and cute bakery items!
,,,,,Definitely highly recommend their chocolate chip walnut cookies!! We've seen people grabbing two of those per person when we visited and soooo glad we got those as well. Surprised that not many reviewers mention them here. It hit just the spot for my chocolate chip cookie crave and they look just like the trendy thicc Levain Bakery's NYC chocolate chip walnut cookies!! So so good.
,,,,,I'm giving 4/5 stars because it's difficult to find parking if you're driving. But the food is superb!!!
,,,,,"This place is very cute, but the food is not always amazing. The place itself is really bright and clean, while the customer service is polite and friendly."
,,,,,"I've ordered the club sandwich here, which was unfulfilling, one of the least satisfying club sandwiches I've ever had. Hard to say what it was about that sandwich... The bread was dry and the filling was lacking in flavor and it was overpriced. Club sandwich is hard to mess up, so I don't know what happened there. I've also tried the various cakes, including a chocolate cherry cheesecake, which looked so gorgeous but it tasted not as great as it looked, although the couple of dark candied cherries they included in that cake were delicious."
,,,,,"I've also ordered the croissants, which were actually pretty good, and the drip coffee, which was high quality. So I'd recommend those."
,,,,,"Really great atmosphere and croissants, but not much else."
,,,,,"Once you walk in, you'll be met by a friendly hostess and the scent of butter wafting through the air. Ahhh. It has a modern, cozy, and rustic atmosphere that makes it worth the visit. "
,,,,,"The food itself could use some work. I had a blueberry muffin which was dense and cake-like, a scone that was borderline bread, and biscuits & gravy that were bland and disappointing. The walnut chocolate chip cookie had a good texture, but it wasn't anything to write home about. A perfectly decent cookie."
,,,,,"The croissant was a different story. You know in Ratatouille when Colette describes fresh bread to Linguini? A ""symphony of crackle,"" she says. She proceeds to hold the bread up to her ear and give it a gentle squeeze to demonstrate. Biting into the chocolate croissant sounded exactly the same. Flaky layers upon layers of delicate bread surrounding two squeezes of chocolate. "
,,,,,"Overall, it's worth a visit for their croissants and atmosphere, but I wouldn't have high expectations for their other items."
,,,,,"I LOVE this location. I've dined in at this location and placed multiple orders to go. Each time was a pleasant experience. Today I picked up a Valentine's Day cake. It was so cute, and tasted delicious. Shout out to Lee for excellent customer service and getting my custom cake. It came in a nice box and was secure driving home. (My previous review was actually for another location that isn't as good as this one, oops)"
,,,,,This bakery is super expensive. I do however enjoy their salads and lunch dishes. The presentation is nice and there to go boxes hold up well.
,,,,,Common Bond will always have a special place in my heart. It's got some tasty pastries that I love. Always a sure way to make someone's morning. I think the pastries are the best thing that the bakery has to offer. Food has always been just okay for me. The montrose location is my fave.
,,,,,1706 Westheimer Rd
,,,,,"Houston, TX 77098"
,,,,,Great place to check out for brunch. This Common Bond location has much more space and many more pastries to try than the other location. You'll walk in and immediately have your eyes drawn to the pastries on display. The kouign aman is delicious with sticky sweet caramelized flaky pastry. Delicious.
,,,,,I've also tried a variety of foods here such as the croque madame (very rich but delicious) as well as the breakfast scramble. The avocado bacon toast is also great!
,,,,,"While the savory dishes at Common Bond are always delicious, the pastries are just okay in my opinion. Went for coffee with some girlfriends and the lavender latte was delicious (the coffee is always top-notch), but the pistachio croissant was mediocre. It comes with this pistachio marzipan type filling and its an overkill of sweetness. The coffee is already sweet then you add an overly sweet croissant, there's a lack of balance and I personally could only eat a couple of bites before feeling sick. If lots of sugar is your thing, go for it, but I'll stick to a plain croissant next time!"
,,,,,I love this spot for my study sessions and my brunches. I love their pastries and drinks. The people there are very friendly. They are good but a lil bit pricey compared to other places.
,,,,,"It's rare for us to come downtown since we live far. Will definitely make the trip more often just for this place! Looking for a quick dessert stop 10 before 8 we asked if we could still go in, since many businesses don't accept costumers close to closing time. They were so welcoming and recommended their favorite treats. The tiramisu, chocolate chip cookies and macrons were the best ! Definitely will come again !"
,,,,,"This place has the potential to be amazing but it just isn't. The bakery items like macarons, croissants, cookies, and scones easily deserve 4 stars for deliciousness but the service is lucky to earn 2 on a good day. Employees and cafe cleanliness leave a lot to be desired, almost as if they would rather they not have customers at all. Of all the pastries I've tried there, this (""fresh from the oven"") blueberry muffin was one of the most disappointing. It was crumbly to the point I couldn't eat it without a fork and the crunchy texture of the sugar topping was just absolutely off putting not to mention overly sweet. Wish I could say it was just an off day but seems to be an ongoing downward trend."
,,,,,If you like kouign aman Common Bond is the place to go! It is one of the best ones I've ever had and the portion is giant. 
,,,,,I also love coming here for Brunch and sit out on their outdoor patio if the weather is nice.
,,,,,"Normally I don't frequent Common Bond because while I do really like their pastries and food, it can get expensive since everything is so tempting and prices add up (think ~$4 for a croissant). That being said, I recently found out a game changer that will definitely have me coming back more often!!:"
,,,,,"Every day, 1 hour before closing, their pastries will be 1/2 off!! This was seriously game changing because I love their pastries and breads so much but can't afford to get $4 croissants that often. I went in a couple days ago ~45 min before closing and got a pistachio croissant, butter croissant, almond croissant, Boston creme, walnut choco chip cookie, apple cider ginger snap cookie, and a whole loaf of bread - everything all together came to a total price of ~$16 which is seriously seriously a steal for this place. Their croissants are huge and so buttery and airy - so worth it. Also their Apple cider ginger snap cookie is maybe one of the best cookies I've ever had- it's super chewy and pillowy with the perfect balance of spice and sweetness. And their bread!!! A WHOLE loaf of multigrain for $2.50 you seriously can't beat that kind of quality with that price. Highly recommend. If you come the hour before closing, come early because I got the last pistachio croissant and Boston creme that day so if you come earlier there may be a bigger selection. "
,,,,,"However not all of their desserts are on sale- the tarts, macarons, and cakes are still full price. Previously when I had gotten the cakes and macarons, I thought the cake was a little too sweet and the macarons were ok for their price. Their pastries are really where the good stuff is in my opinion. "
,,,,,Definitely recommend here if you want to get a great croissant and some great bread!! 
,,,,,"In terms of parking, they have a lot right next to their door. However I've had problems finding a spot there during peak brunch hours. When I went there around 8pm though, I had no problem finding parking"
,,,,,"I went in to have breakfast this morning and was disappointed by the morning attitude at Common Bond Montrose. With the exception of one employee, I was met with a distinct lack of interest. In fact, real hostility might be more appropriate. It does not seem that ordering a 14.00 breakfast sandwich demands much civility."
,,,,,Hmmmmm....
,,,,,"Common Bond is my neighborhood bakery  and there are many things to love about this spot. However, in the age of covid when waiting around is not only irritating but dangerous, they need to step up their staff. I waited half and hour for an iced coffee and the bar was a mess. Please get a clorox wipe going and invest in a few more employees."
,,,,,"Sadly, this Houston bakery which started off with fireworks , had sold out to new management and is mediocre  at best. From the tacky blinking sign at the entrance to the bland and overpriced fruit tart, there is just disappointment for lunch at this cafe."
,,,,,Really a shame that the management might believe that Houston customers wouldn't notice the drop in quality .
,,,,,First time to visit here today to have lunch with my sister-in-law. The pastries were all beautifully made. The cakes are Instagram-worthy.
,,,,,"I had the butternut squash soup, which was topped with pumpkin seeds and sour cream. Loved the creaminess! My sister-in-law got the quiche florentine, which came with a side salad. I had a piece of the quiche and it was delicious. She enjoyed the french onion soup too. My husband had the Nashville hot chicken sandwich. It was moist and crunchy but the chicken was small. There was more bun than chicken."
,,,,,"I bought several pastries mostly to share my neighbor. Hopefully she'll like the pumpkin cheese croissant, pistachio croissant, and kugelhopf (classic and boston cream). My sister-in-law bought pastries to go as well. Hers were a couple of different scones, peppermint croissant, and a loaf of multigrain bread. "
,,,,,This place is popular for sure. The tables were full and there was a line. Will have to go back and try the desserts.
,,,,,"Stopped by Common Bond early in the AM because it came highly recommended by a few friends. We ordered the almond croissant, chocolate chip walnut cookie, and hazelnut chocolate muffin. The standout item was by far the almond croissant. It's hard to find a good almond croissant and this one definitely lived up to my expectations. The chocolate chip walnut cookie was okay, and the muffin was definitely lacking in flavor. It seems like their croissants are what they are known for, so highly recommend those if in the Montrose area!"

,,,,,"I ordered a simple (smash) cake and 12 cupcakes as a custom order for my daughters first birthday. Working with their contact for custom cakes was such a pleasure. She was so professional, and was so easy to work with through email. When they first told me to call their custom cakes contact, I was concerned my order was too small and not important (they also do wedding cakes). However I received a response within a day or two of contacting them, and the order was seamless. I even ordered the week of the event! "
,,,,,"As far as the actual product, the cake was tasty, but I went with simple vanilla buttercream since it was also for a baby. I bet their other flavors are better! The confetti cupcakes were actually fluffier and better in my opinion. I prefer fluffier versus the denser vanilla. I also think keeping the cakes in the fridge overnight might have compromised some of the flavor, but everything was really delicious! "
,,,,,Seriously though A++ for customer service. I would definitely order from them again.
,,,,,"Their desserts and pastries are all fresh and delicious! Unfortunately , I won't be dining here anymore. They don't accept cash."
,,,,,"Omg this may be my new favorite place in this area!  My coffee was amazing!  The pastries and desserts were incredible!  My salad was amazing!  Only downside was they didn't have ranch and my keto diet doesn't like sugary vinaigrette's, but it was delicious!!!  My daughter got amazing sliders and a huge amount of delicious fries!  Definitely coming back."
,,,,,"Delicious baked goods and lunch. The parking lot can fill up. We swing by and if it's packed try again later, worth it."
,,,,,Came in to grab a couple of desserts. We enjoyed the fruit tart and turtle brownie. The service was ok and the turtle brownie was VERY rich So be prepared for that and the tart was very good in my opinion.
,,,,,Poor management. There was no place to sit and still they were taking orders. They asked to sit outside when it was so windy and with tables covered in dust. I mean why let people order when there's no place to sit. Super disappointed with the staff.
,,,,,"Very nice place decided to go after visiting the menil art museum. Food was amazing family had the po boy, burger and grilled cheese. They have many yummy desserts  had to get some to go. Coffee and wine bar was also great! A must try!"
,,,,,"I'm writing this as we're sitting at Einstein Brothers because despite two attempts, they couldn't get a simple order right. We ordered the sausage and egg sandwich and specifically asked for it dry with a well cooked egg. As soon as it came out, we could tell the egg was very runny. I went back to the counter and they said they would make another one.  Well the egg was fine, but it had what looked like the aioli on it. When I said something to the girl that brought it, her comment was that it wasn't aioli, it was mayonnaise! How it that dry? What moron decided that they would substitute Mayo for aioli. At this point we were so disgusted with it, that we just left. So I got to have my yogurt alone, while my partner got nothing. "
,,,,,"Also they wouldn't have a long line if they worked smarter. One guy's only job was to get pastries, so when no one needed them, instead of helping with orders he just stood there doing nothing.  I'd leave 0 stars if that was an option. Will never go back"
,,,,,Cute little gem that always hits the spot! I always order the almond croissant and the tomato basil soup! I always park at the additional parking spaces one street down.
,,,,,"Very nice breakfast/brunch spot with delectable dishes, and some pretty good coffee as well :)"
,,,,,"Good social distancing protocols, monitoring how many people are in the shop at a time, and tables well distanced to reduce capacity for those dining in. "
,,,,,"We got in before the rush came and were lucky to get a corner spot where we could people watch while we enjoyed our breakfast fare that was deliciously savory, sweet, or bitter, depending on the bite (or sip). "
,,,,,"The shrimp and grits were different from what I've had before in that it came with a salad, there was a soupy sauce, and the grits were very coarse (you could see portions of the kernel in it). It was very tasty but did get to be a bit heavy after a while, so mixing in some liquids or chocolate helped to balance it out a bit. "
,,,,,1706 Westheimer Rd
,,,,,"The cortado was very nice, fluffy cream on the top, not too bitter, and decent portion as well. "
,,,,,"The coconut pastry was a nice find as well, with a milk chocolate shell for the coconut itself, with coconut cream and bits inside with pineapple on top and a chocolate straw; so good!"
,,,,,"Houston, TX 77098"
,,,,,"Nice and delicious pastries but pricy ,"
,,,,,you have variety of choices 
,,,,,They also have food and wine 
,,,,,I ordered almond croissant and coffee and I really love the ambiance
,,,,,"People of the world, if you love sweets, you love art, you love baked goods, you love nice decor, and you love friendly people, they you got to try out Common Bond! Just look at the pictures and you can tell everything is beautiful! We stopped by this place, as we were in the Inner Westheimer district and were overjoyed!! I got soo much food to try and left really happy! Wish I could buy the entire menu to give a critique! Well, I guess that's why there is next time!! Come out and support them, you will love it. ChowChow Time!!"
,,,,,"Came here for brunch. There was a pretty long line but it was worth it! We got the Chicken and Biscuits, Onion Soup, Truffle Mac N Cheese, and the mushroom goat cheese flatbread. They were all delicious! The flatbread is now one of my favorites. The crew were very friendly and helpful. I love how they had cups of water out by the coffee bar ready to grab. Brilliant idea! I would definitely come again for another brunch!"
,,,,,Came here for breakfast . I wish I could have tried everything as the pastries looked amazing. I got avocado toast and coffee . Quick service and self serve dining . Stellar place !!
,,,,,"This is definitely a cute little brunch spot. The lattes are good, I have yet to try the pastries but they look so yummy and pretty. I've had the vanilla lattes here and they are always good, the avocado toast and the shrimp and grits are pretty good as well."
,,,,,"Delicious pastries and goodies ! Seasonal pumpkin croissant and apple cider ginger snap cookies, and even spiced apples! They serve alcohol too, beer, and wine. And their coffees are unique and scrumptious too... we got a lavender latte :) "
,,,,,The flatbreads are so big and delicious. We got the mushroom and goat cheese. 
,,,,,Will definitely be back for more!
,,,,,I like the space but the food I ordered was not warm and was dry.
,,,,,I've been here before but the time I'm writing this review was my least favorite. (Yes I enjoyed it more the other times). I'll probably be back but to order something else for breakfast.
,,,,,The iced cold brew coffee is a little diluted but I can just barely taste it.
,,,,,"The chocolate chip cookie, however, is extremely chocolatey, so if you're into that, get some!"
,,,,,This spot is pretty popular and this is my paragraph for review. Come give The Common Bond a try.
,,,,,Supporting one of my favorite local restaurants. 
,,,,,"I usually come here for dessert but I've been on a ""fry hunt"" looking for the best fries in town and had to order the Truffle Parmesan Fries to give them a try. "
,,,,,The Parmesan and truffle were very apparent which I loved. My only complaint would be that they were a little too greasy for me. 
,,,,,I'll be back for more of their delicious cakes and pastries
,,,,,"Amazing quality of freshly baked goodies. Only recommendation would be to maybe add another cashier to keep the line moving, especially during busy hours? Some customers just want a cup of coffee to go..but the wait can be too long so they turn around. Can argue..it is worth it."
,,,,,Really good breakfast place! The location is nice and central. Definitely recommend it if you haven't been.
,,,,,1706 Westheimer Rd
,,,,,"Houston, TX 77098"
,,,,,"DELICOUS! I like this place a lot. The service is good, they usually get you thru the line with minimum wait time. The croissants are fresh and phenomenal. Only reason it's 4 stars and not 5 is because of their Nutella croissant. It was just TOO much Nutella where I couldn't even eat half of it. As well the scrambled egg dish was not to my liking but I can see it being for others. Otherwise good place!"
,,,,,"The cafe is cute and we'd eaten there before - sandwiches, patisserie, etc are all excellent. But it's the cake that Kim and the artists made that really blew me away. I had a pretty simple description: please make a delicious, veggie garden themed cake for my dad's birthday. Wow did they deliver. The cake is delicious and the decor absolutely spectacular from every angle. So very happy. Thanks!"
,,,,,"This is our weekend go-to. All of their pastries are consistently high quality, fresh, and delicious. We also enjoy their seasonal coffee drinks. "
,,,,,"You walk into the restaurant and are greeted with a bright, light-filled space, very large inside and there is a patio outside. There's a large glass case with pastries, cookies, macarons, other sweets, and cakes. Many different loaves of bread on the back wall as well! Order at the counter Togo or order to eat in. "
,,,,,Their lunch items are good too and the portions are huge. 
,,,,,The staff are always friendly and helpful!
,,,,,"By far one of my favorite spots in Houston, and this location specifically is great."
,,,,,Just came here for a little brunch moment and loved it! I got the kids grilled cheese and the strawberry chocolate passion and both were delicious. My brother had the kids chicken strips and my mom had the burger with parmesan fries and they loved it as well. The kids meals were pretty big and filled me up! Also the owner was super nice and gave us a free hot chocolate! Customer service was great and so was the food! Definitely will be back.
,,,,,"Let's just be honest, this place have the best coffee products. I used to drive to Starbucks and get in line sometimes for 30 min and I don't know what kind of syrup they add, but their coffee looks fake and oily. Now, I am sad because after living here for almost 5 yrs I just found Common Bond that is 3 min away from my house, but we are 6 months away from moving to a new house :( Anyway, we had a very nice cake I forgot the name of it and I get a daily coffee served by Efe I, he is a very nice guy with the best Customer Service. Thank you guys and thanks Efe for making my day."
,,,,,I had their tomato and ricotta flatbread and I loved it!! It had lots of veggies and the balsamic vinegar really ties it all together. 
,,,,,Common Bond is known for their varied of pastries. Their chocolate and butter croissants are super flaky. The Kouign Amann has a crunchy sugared outer layer whilst being soft and somewhat flaky inside. The blueberries muffin is somewhat pedestrian but it does have a sweet aftertaste to it.
,,,,,TLDR: It has great bakery items and offers a nice environment to catch up with friends. 
,,,,, 
,,,,,"I stopped by on a Saturday while I was in Houston for the weekend. The place is super busy, and most people were taking their orders to go. The staffs were friendly and patient. It took me a few minutes to decide what I wanted to order. The only downside about this location is that it is so small. With the COVID-19 situation, there are not many seat options. You do have the opportunity to sit outside if the weather permits. "
,,,,,I got an Almond Croissant and a Cortado. The croissant is one of the best I have ever tried. The filling is not too sweet with a good balance almond flavor. 
,,,,,I would go back if I ever found myself in the area.
,,,,,"After a less than satisfactory experience at the Medical Center store, I decided to give Common Bond another chance. About 3 weeks ago, I visited the Montrose location. My breakfast was very good; however, I was taken aback by having to stare at the ""F"" word written on the men's room wall above the urinal. I reported this to the manager, Ashley, and she contacted the corporate office. Before I left, she came by my table and said it would be cleaned up that week."
,,,,,Here it is 3 weeks later and...nothing has been done. So I asked Ashley about it. She explained that they had been too busy to fulfill their commitment. Wow!!! Just wow!!! No more Common Bond for this foodie...I'm beyond dumbfound.
,,,,,"What a treat! Just pickup some cakes and sweets, and really enjoyed. Croissants are very crispy, especially pistachio one was outstanding. They have fancy treats, if you want amazing start off your day, visit Common Bond Bistro."
,,,,,"Nice place, staff is attentive and sweet, food is very good.  Pastries and coffee are excellent."
,,,,,1706 Westheimer Rd
,,,,,"Houston, TX 77098"
,,,,,Perfectly light yet hardy breakfast; lox at @commonbondbistroandbakery. Montrose location has quick service and lots of parking make this an easy option if you're on the go. Or sit outside and enjoy your meal on the large dog friendly patio.
,,,,,"Occasionally, I believe in self indulgence, especially during a pandemic. This means treating myself to a chocolate nutella croissant and an almond croissant! The bakery goodies never fail to disappoint at Common Bond. However, sometimes the customer services can lag, which is disappointing. It's more of an attitude, which they should cultivate more to better welcome customers. Perhaps, it's a millennial too cool for school attitude with the guy behind the goods... this can come off pretentious and annoying. Otherwise, the food does not disappoint. And for the most part, customer service is good. I may have had an off day. Otherwise, the food is always tasty. Unfortunately, I may have had an off date."
,,,,,HRW FTW!!! So worth and very filling. 
,,,,,"Ordered by calling in a togo order and got the tomato basil soup (hearty & flavorful), CHARCUTERIE BAGUETTE (delicious bread and yummy deli meats/veggies) and the trio macaroons). 2nd order tomato basil soup, Texas club sandwich (toasted bread and yummy deli meats) and the turtle brownie (very rich). They had a designated parking spot for togo/pick ups in the front of the restaurant. And you just call them when you arrive. You can pay ahead through the phone or in person. Would come back for sure for a simple brunch/lunch!"
,,,,,Unique breakfast menu items with large array of sweets.  Really enjoyed the biscuits and jalapeño pork sausage gravy topped off with an egg.
,,,,,Tasty decaf espresso blend.
,,,,,Parking lot is too small and the spaces are narrow; beware the rude patrons that park so close that you cannot get in your car.
,,,,,Good really do have very pastries. They have or did have a really good ham sandwich. I do recommend the Common Bond. Enjoy.
,,,,,"Amazing... everything! Seriously, I was beyond impressed with all of the food items we ordered for brunch as well as the incredible job they do with their branding/packaging. "
,,,,,A few of the highlights:
,,,,,"Avocado toast: the seeded bread gives you that crunch every time, even if you don't have a radish in your bite. "
,,,,,Parmesan fries: perfectly cooked and crispy even with this being a togo order
,,,,,Bacon/egg flatbread: cheesy with so many yummy toppings
,,,,,"ALL of the pastries! Although I'm sad we didn't eat the pistachio croissant, I've heard so many good things about that "
,,,,,"Yes, this was way too much food for 3 people. We had leftovers but got to enjoy so many different bites of food."
,,,,,Our review is based on the pastries we ordered. We got the mocha mascarpone tart and kouign amann which was recommended by the server. Both were extremely rich and delish! I can see why this place is super popular.
,,,,,"They tell you in their name who they are, so I shouldn't have been surprised to have a perfectly ""common"" experience here. "
,,,,,I always want Common Bond to be better than it is. But every time I come here I leave with a renewed sense of why it's just better to cook at home. 
,,,,,"This morning I ordered a flatbread. When it arrived it looked delicious. Sadly it was not. Halfway through eating it I literally thought, ""Maybe I've contracted Covid-19 because I can't taste anything."" Unfortunately/fortunately I do not have coronavirus and my tastebuds have not betrayed me. What has betrayed me is the chef who is responsible for creating a breakfast pizza void of flavor. It's actually an accomplishment. I mean, how do you make bacon bland?! "
,,,,,"Largely reminiscent of the BBQ Lean Cuisine pizza, I kept thinking, ""I paid twenty bucks for this!! The Lean Cuisine is only 3 bucks and will save me 17 dollars over this insult to flavor."""
,,,,,I just kept looking for a bottle of Sriracha.....anything to put some modicum of taste on the food. I left without eating a 1/4 of it. 
,,,,,"Common Bond is the place you go when you are stuck in an airport on a long layover. Its easy to forgive airport food because it's.....airport food. But I've had lots of airport food better than it. Common Bond is cutesy and looks appealing but at the end of the day it's just a place to go to get the job done on your way to whatever is next. For me, it was a trip to McDonalds to get a McGriddle. Although I'll have cramps for the rest of the day, I'll at least have tasted something and not feel......common."
,,,,,This is a solid bakery and bistro.  We really enjoyed the oatmeal cookie sandwiches.  The employees were nice and did their job well!
,,,,,"The food is good, however they usually play music extremely loud! Sometimes they have been nice and reduced it so I can get school or work done without so much distraction. However I came in once and asked twice, saw them asking what I'm assuming is a manager and it never got lowered. It was so loud people were yelling and couldn't hear each other. I was even using my head phones and it didn't help! Think it's pretty rude that he couldn't lower it a bit!"
,,,,,"Airways a great place to enjoy a coffee and dessert and hang out with friends.. disappointed there's no WiFi  as I would love to study here, but besides that the food and drinks are always amazing!"

,,,,,"Houston, TX 77098"
,,,,,"Common Bond is my favorite pastry place in Houston! I am a huge fan of the pistachio croissant, the chocolate walnut cookie, and the fruit tart (the best I've ever had)! It's such a cute brunch and pastry place and there are so many different options. They also have a cafe inside. I like that they have a parking lot and you can avoid street parking if it's not super busy. They have 50% off all of the pastries in the hour before closing every day so I love going during that time. I go here a couple times a week and definitely recommend this place to everyone!"
,,,,,Common Bond is definitely my favorite pastry spot in Houston! I love the deal they're running where their pastries are all 50% in the hour before they close everyday. The pistachio croissant is definitely my favorite. I also like the chocolate walnut cookie.
,,,,,Line goes by pretty quick and they'll only let you in if there's enough tables. I ordered the salmon tartan which was ok - a bit dry but  their dish of the day was the crawfish Benedict which was absolutely delicious.
,,,,,Their almond croissant and the kouign amann are good. I recommend heating up the kouign amann for 10 seconds in the microwave for a late midnight snack.
,,,,,Also what's nice is you can place an order to go before sitting down for your meal and pick it up once you're finished with your meal. Definitely recommend their frose which we ordered on the go. The container alone that comes with it is worth it and you just place it in the freezer when you get home if you don't want to drink it right away.
,,,,,Yummmmm!
,,,,,What we got:
,,,,,Kouign Amann
,,,,,Pistachio croissant
,,,,,Nutella croissant
,,,,,Cold brew
,,,,,"Cute bistro and bakery! Lots of selections to choose from that I wanted to get everything, but I can't so I settled for the 3 pastries and their cold brew and they were decadent! This place could easily be a favorite in New York City if they had a location there!"
,,,,,"What not to like, great location, delicious food, very tempting pastries, fresh bread! Parking is a little tough in Montrose in general so their parking lot is very much appreciated."
,,,,,"Delicious pastries and breakfasts.  We frequently have breakfast delivered from here.  Love the chocolate and pistachio croissants.  The one time I went in person to get breakfast to go, it was very crowded and parking was a hassle.  It's hard to hold that against them, however, because the food is so darned good."
,,,,,"Common Bond is easily my favorite bakery in Houston. They have EVERYTHING, and the menu items are impressive."
,,,,,"Was looking up different bakeries in the area, and this place popped up. I won it's OK get some special treats for my birthday so I stopped by on Sunday afternoon. I had the pistachio croissant (2.5/5), almond croissant (3.5/5) morning bun (4/5), fruit tart (2/) and the vegan gingerbread cookie (1/5). They have so many options to choose from. Employee was super helpful in helping me make decisions. They also informed me that an hour before closing, all of their bakery items are 50% off. The bakery was super cute and the staff were very helpful."
,,,,,"Pistachio croissant - decent. I saw a lot of people raving about it on here so I gave it a try. nice layer of filling. I just wasn't sold. The croissant itself was OK, but the filling what is the best part."
,,,,,Vegan gingerbread cookie - OK. It was oily on the bottom. Definitely can taste the punch of  ginger which was nice but it just wasn't a great cookie.
,,,,,"Almond croissant and the morning bun were probably the best things I had. The filling was great. Croissant had a nice chew and wasn't too sweet. The morning bun was described to me as a churro. It tasted more like a croissant covered in cinnamon and sugar. I can see the similarities with a churro, but that's not how I would've described it. I typically love morning buns, and I would describe them as a cross between a cinnamon roll and a croissant. This one had no cinnamon or sugar and the inside, just the outside. "
,,,,,Fruit tart was decent. I've definitely had better.
,,,,,"We've been here a few times and have yet to be disappointed. Staff always wears masks, which is great to see. Also, they're conscious of pronouns for their employees!"
,,,,,"We've tried pastries all of our previous visits, but this time we decided to go with drinks. I got an iced mocha which was nice and strong but not bitter. Hubs got a chai tea, but it was so spicy that he couldn't finish it."
,,,,,"Tables are often full, so if you want to sit, be prepared to go outside or wait. I definitely recommend the pastries - I've never had a less than delectable one. Just use caution on drinks."
,,,,,"We've been to Common Bond multiple times for their baked goods and always enjoy them! We've also had dinner here a time or two, which was also yummy albeit a bit pricey for a small cafe. The triple chocolate brown butter cookie we tried yesterday was hands down one of the best cookies I've had. It was served warm, so the chocolate was all melty and delicious - ugh, amazing. We also really enjoy their macarons, although the mango passion was a miss IMO. Also yesterday we happened to walk in during happy hour and tried their $3 lavender mimosas, which were light and refreshing! One recommendation, though: continue to swirl the drink throughout consumption otherwise you'll end up with a mouthful of lavender flavoring at the end. Give this cute cafe a try! I know we will continue to stop by for tasty treats!"
,,,,,"This place is just mid in my opinion. Everything is really over priced (I guess expected from a location close to downtown). Macarons are $3 each but they're so tiny, you can get better quality macs at an actual macaron shop and they cost less too! Coffee is okay here, nothing life changing. I got a Panini for $12. It was good and a decent size. Overall I wouldn't really come again unless i'm in the area and wanted something quick to eat like the pastries!"

,,,,,"Common Bond is a neat bakery/bistro in our area. If you go on the weekend, be prepared to wait. Sometimes the line is out of the door, sometimes it takes a while for a table to free up. They have some unique menu items. I do think that their macarons while delicious are a bit pricey. And sometimes the quality isn't all the way through. For instance this past weekend I got 6 macarons, 4 of the flavors were great and soft with just the right amount of crunch. But one of the flavors (which I got 2 of) were so hard I could hardly bite into them."
,,,,,"Their pastries is where it's at (get the pistachio croissant!). Their coffee is awful and inedible. I'm not sure who's been making their drinks, but it's been consistently terrible and I've wasted my money by giving them another chance. I also order way ahead of time online and my orders have never been fulfilled on time. This place used to be amazing but lately the quality is subpar. They need to do some changes in management and training then hire qualified baristas to make the drinks."
,,,,,"This cafe is great when you want to hang out with a couple of friends and catch up, but there were a few things that I didn't enjoy. Their coffee is overpriced for a small cup of coffee that doesn't really taste like it's worth it. The space is very small and it can get very busy, so if you are on the run or want a pick me up, the wait will be quite long. For parking, there is a small lot that they share with other businesses so it is quite limited. "
,,,,,"I really like the appearance of the cafe, it is very well decorated and the color scheme of the restaurant is great. I also like the touch of the marble counters and the bar stools for the coffee bar. It's also clean and I would highly recommend their pistachio croissant and Lavender Latte!"
,,,,,"Have to update my review from the last time I've been at Common Bond. I went here on a Sunday evening and the service was so bad. First off, my friends latte came out with lipstick marks on the cup. When we asked to replace, the service gave us a weird look. I think it's pretty reasonable to not want to drink from a cup that's not properly cleaned! Also I ordered a Prosecco and they charged me for it but after a long wait, they came back and said they do not have Prosecco. The guy who was explaining to me said they didn't charge me for it even though I definitely paid for the Prosecco from my bank statement. After that, he said he will take care of it and remove the Prosecco charge from their end. My other friend asked to heat up her pastries and they said no. She also had to wait at least 30 mins for her london fog. When we went up to check up on it, the only response we got was not sure what happened but we don't have it, we will make a new one. I'd  say the quality of the pastries and coffee stays consistent High disappointed by this place's customer service."
,,,,,Best bakery in houston!! Everything there is super yummy and light so perfect place to go after lunch or dinner for sweets. Parking is super easy with a private parking lot and it's easy to find in Montrose! Can walk around the area after for a fun experience
,,,,,"So, Common Bond has been go-to bakery/ restaurant since before the pandemic and now I appreciate this eatery even more. The food is just goooood! And the outdoor patio is perfect in the evenings. The food is consistently delicious. The service is always delightful and helpful. This sandwich is Memphis hot Chicken....one of the last entrees I've sampled. Oh my goodness! Come Try it!"
,,,,,This is a great cafe to come to for good food and drinks when you want a lowkey vibe. Their Nashville hot chicken sandwich tastes so good!! The grilled cheese and soup combo is good - nothing special but it's a staple. If you're a fan of oatmeal pies you gotta try theirs! It's so yummy!! I also tried their lavender mimosa and I'm HOOKED. It looks like white wine but it definitely doesn't taste like it - the lavender flavor is lovely and delicate.
,,,,,"Very late to the game here and to add insult to injury I'll confess I haven't made it inside the restaurant. Due to the long wait on. a Sat morning we did a quick phone order (different menu available for this). The wait for our curbside pick up was as pleasant as could be and our bacon egg flatbread and chocolate ganache cookies were delicious. The iced coffee was literally the icing on a great morning for me-perfectly blended and just the right amount of sweetness and ice, The ordering process was super easy and the the waitress who took our order was so sweet! I really can't wait to go back and try it for a real brunch."
,,,,,Brought my daughter here after daycare thinking her and I could enjoy an afternoon of Mommy Cappuccino and Hibiscus tea for her. I looked at the website with coming here prepared to order some yummy treats! The macaroons were spot on as well as the treats ! Though I was served with little to no engagement. The place is cool but the service is COLD and uninviting. I was really looking for a place that would my go to place since I work less than a block away with a few hundred caffeine enthusiasts like myself but with was a miss. ::Sad::
,,,,,solid pastries 
,,,,,i loved the pistachio croissant!! 4.1/5 i just wish it were a little more crispy
,,,,,the tart was also very yummm
,,,,,"The original common bond was sold in 2016 to Carraba's. Like all business that eventually get sold, costs need to be cut or prices needed to be increased to capture the returns. The original head baker/chef Roy Shvartzapel made Common Bond an incredible spot. Since it has been sold, it has changed and I'm STILL chasing the original high of the original techniques and recipes. "
,,,,,"They definitely have changed their recipes or the way they make their croissants. Their croissants used to be extremely flaky and like croissants from France. Now they don't have many layers and are soft. If you don't believe me, look at the photos of the croissants from when they first opened to what they looked like now. COMPLETELY different. "
,,,,,"They used to have croissants when you took a bite the flakes would be over your face, making a huge mess BUT SO DELIGHTFUL. Now its just some soft croissants that kind of taste the same everywhere."
,,,,,"I have posted a photo. CLEARLY the old croissants were crispier, flakier, and had much more layers. The new ones are soft, don't flake at all when I take a bite into them and definitely have LESS layers. This wasn't a fluke. I've been to common bond many times hoping that it was just an OFF day."
,,,,,"The manager did reach out to me to try to make it better but unless they go back to their old techniques... it just won't be the same. I imagine with 4 locations in Houston now, they probably centralize some of their production in order to scale which might be the reason for change in process."
,,,,,Very good but they changed their croissant recipe. It used to be much crunchier and have many more layers. Now the croissants just tastes like a gourmet croissant you can get anywhere. Their old recipe used to taste like croissants you can get from France.
,,,,,"We split the texas club sandwich, shrimp and grits, and some truffle fries and everything was basically great. I think the ratios on the club involved a bit too much turkey and not enough tomato/mayo but the overall experience is a good one. The shrimp and grits are very solid as well. Would love to come back and try the french dip and those levain like cookies that were calling to me through the counter."

,,,,,Common Bond continues to hit it out of the ball park where today for a brief moment I forgot I was in Houston Texas during my late lunch. 
,,,,,"Common Bond is well known for its baked goods, tarts and treats but the actual lunch menu items are incredible too. This has become my favorite lunch spot. Portions are reasonable, the ingredients are always fresh and the food actually tastes like it was made with love."
,,,,,"The smoked Salmon Croissant Sandwich today was so flavorful my neighbors were looking at me making faces of joy and ecstasy as I ate it. The flatbread also was incredibly inspired, fresh, well prepared and right on the money in every way possible. "
,,,,,The space is beautiful however a little small for the number of clientele this spot pulls. Still it is a nice well lit clean comfortable space to have a quick lunch or snack with a friend. Many many conversations are had over coffee and desserts on tables next to mine. 
,,,,,"I always find something wrong with even the most perfect place so following this tradition,  I would like Common Bond to serve a better variety of cold drinks. I want regular coke maybe a couple of other American staples. Then Again you might say wait a sec weren't you just raving about how this place didn't feel like America? Touché!"
,,,,,"The food here is delicious. Great, quick service,"
,,,,,I haven't tried their pastries but they look beautiful. Looking forward to going back.
,,,,,"Common Bond is a great place to order a treat, grab a hot or cold beverage, and people watch others making their orders. They also have these beautiful whimsical cakes on display in different sizes. I've always wanted to order one for a loved one's birthday but I don't want to be disappointed or embarrassed if they're not good and I have a feeling that they may be mediocre."
,,,,,"Anywho, during my staycation in my great city of Houston I decided to order dinner from here. I settled on a turkey club, truffle French fries and a turtle brownie pastry thingy for dessert. "
,,,,,"I thought I couldn't go wrong with a turkey club sandwich but boy was I wrong. Now the sandwich itself looked so delicious. Toasted white bread with Turkey, thick bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. It may have had cheese. I don't remember. Maybe not since I'm not a cheese fanatic. Oh, it also had thick slices of delicious avocado. "
,,,,,"The turkey on the sandwich was slimy and stale. It was so accrid that  I ended up throwing the whole thing straight into the garbage. Yuck, it was so gross! So gross! "
,,,,,The fries were okay but the star was the turtle brownie dessert. It was rich and decadent. Sort of like an upscale brownie. Very scrumptious and we'll made. I could have just skipped the sandwich and fries and just enjoyed the brownie with a tea. 
,,,,,I'll probably be back as all of my out of town visitors love coming here and to be fair so do I. I'll just be careful what I order. They haven't lost me as a customer.
,,,,,"Dear plain croissant, void of chocolate and marzipan, you are enough. You have won me over with your rich buttery layers of fluffy goodness. "
,,,,,"Chocolate chip cookie, fraternal twin of Levains in New York. You are delicious yumminess!"
,,,,,"Lemon tart, sweet and tart......and oh so sublime. I shall be back. I shall."
,,,,,"Food was good and employees were nice and helpful. It's a nice open space with windows, plenty of plug-ins, so making a good place to work with free Wi-Fi. They just opened up so it's pretty quiet right now and I like it like that. Only a few blocks from me and across from the park so it makes it a good breakfast date place also"
,,,,,"While initially I was delighted that common bond was expanding beyond this location, it's unfortunately growth that's too fast and inconsistent."
,,,,,"I went to the Katy Freeway location recently, and one of the pastries was gummy and the other was dry. I have the expectation that common bond produces great pastries, however in my recent experiences have shown me otherwise."
,,,,,"When I attempted to call this location, all of the phone options redirected me to their website not an actual human -- much less a manager. "
,,,,,Their commissary apparently has very few quality checks as these massive orders are being shipped off to other locations. It's only retroactively that they find out about quality control issues after it's already made its way to the hands of customers.
,,,,,They don't have enough quality check processes in place to make sure that their products are always fresh and that the commissary isn't messing up massive amounts of pastries for to go locations.
,,,,,"Always enjoy my warm croissant and hot coffee. Staff is nice and patient, especially because I always want to try something new and ask for their opinion and always go back to my croissant."
,,,,,Adorable corner and very small spot in the Montrose. Small! You can find additional parking down Dunlavy should you need. This area has boomed so traffic is only getting worse so most likely will only come back once in a blue moon. Houston restaurant week was okay tasting. Had better as we close 2021's event. The service is excellent though. Very kind staff. Thank you. Cheers!
,,,,,Super yummy!! 
,,,,,Came here for lunch with some friends - the line was pretty long and it was difficult to find seating but overall great experience.
,,,,,Slightly on the pricey side but very tasty.
,,,,,"The pastry selection is absolutely amazing, everything made my mouth water!"
,,,,,The cranberry orange scone was delightful - the sweet frosting balanced out the crumbly scone.
,,,,,"The Nutella croissant was doused with Nutella (which can be good or bad depending on how you look at it), very heavy but the croissant was truly amazing. "
,,,,,The brussel sprouts were my Favorite- I can't wait to go back just for these - they are perfectly roasted and soft. The honey glaze and pancetta pair so well! No one can say that they don't like brussel sprouts after eating this dish!
,,,,,"Super cute spot to visit, quite busy but worth a stop!"
,,,,,***WARNING***
,,,,,This place is filled with flies and the crew is used to it when you ask the staff about it (black lady with mushroom earings and mexican lady who picks up everything with her gloves she wore since she idk maybe clocked in at work)they just  shrug their shoulders like the flies are part of the decor of the pastry. Used to go here a lot when I'm in Houston.

,,,,,"Houston, TX 77098"
,,,,,"Small quaint place that has a well known reputation. Barely any available parking on site, so be prepared to park a little further away and walk."
,,,,,The coffee bar area looks great. The coffee is just alright. They do have a good variety of milks and flavors to spice up your lattes and cappuccinos. A little pricey (but reasonable for the location).
,,,,,"Apparently I've been getting the wrong things each time i visit. (Upon multiple friend's recommendations, next time I'm going to give the Kouinn Amann). "
,,,,,"The bakery looks visually appealing, but the last time I visited, there were unfortunately a couple of flies flying around behind the sneeze guards. Hopefully this was just a one off, as i understand that it's difficult for bakeries to deal with those issue; and thus it wouldn't deter me from visiting again in the future."
,,,,,Common Bond lunches cannot be beat!!! I always stop in for a sandwich being a nursing student is very stressful it's awesome to have common bond so close to campus so I can treat myself between classes and indulge in the amazing sandwiches they have!!! Definitely a musttttt the bread is delicious and the ingredients and quality super fresh! My nursing study buddies and I always stop in and grab coffee and sandwiches we love common bond!!!
,,,,,Late-night craving and weird macarons
,,,,,"Today was my first time visiting turns out most bakeries, sweet shops in Houston close early, and Common Bond Bistro don't so we arrived 30 or less minutes before closing even if they were already cleaning and picking up chairs, the staff was super polite and still let us sit down anyway, we didn't stay we just waited for our drink and left. "
,,,,,I got a caramel latte which was excellent!
,,,,,4 different types of macarons which were questionable...?
,,,,,vanilla and strawberry were good
,,,,,Lavender as expected was soapy and oddly super hard 
,,,,,but the worse one was the manga passion it tasted like french fries???? like why
,,,,,"On the other hand all the cake, small desserts were excellent I really enjoy the black forest "
,,,,,"so great staff, great cakes, not so great macarons"
,,,,,I'm not sure what happened to the quality of this place..??!! When it was previously owned by the Roy Shvartzapel the breads cookies etc very good and when first changed hands to Ruggles owners. Now I'm not so sure my son claim that their cookies and croissants are inedible...I hope they get their QA back to where it used to be if not going i'm taking my business elsewhere or my own house bakery.
,,,,,Love the bakery however hope they would change it up and do new bakery items. Watch out for weekends...hard to find parking and many bakery items sold out early.
,,,,,"Food is great, and the pastries and cookies are out of this world, but this location is consistently disappointing. My recommendation is:  "
,,,,,"If you are interested in food from Common Bond food, order it to go."
,,,,,"Why? Chaos! For all of the great culinary perfection, they don't know how to manage the ""patron's floor"" of a restaurant. It's too complicated to explain in full, but I will share what happened today, which is somewhat exemplary to what we have experienced every time we've graced this restaurant in the past couple of years:"
,,,,,"1. We asked for both of our pastries to be heated. They were both placed, as usual, in a non-commercial broiler oven, which does not work. The food was served less than lukewarm. We ask that it be reheated, and even so, it was reserved not warmed to a level that any reasonable person would expect. I told the server that it was disappointing that the oven didn't work, and she said ""I know!""  We have actually promised ourselves that we were never coming back to this restaurant - and told the management so - as a result of this one thing, but alas we decided to give them another try and, alas once again we were disappointed. Can't they invest 50 bucks in a new broiler oven, especially since they're hell-bent on not having a commercial level oven to heat their products?"
,,,,,"2. When I placed our order, I was told that I could wait at the barista counter for our serving of orange juice.  After standing in place for 10 minutes, I gave up. Our food arrived at our table before the orange juice was ready, meaning we did not have a drink with our food. Eventually, the orange juice was ready; however, ice had been added, which diluted the orange juice, took away nearly all flavor, and resulted in us having to throw it away ... a waste of $3.25 plus tax."
,,,,,"3. When I placed my order, I asked for a side of butter with my croissant. The young woman who took my order joyfully said, ""of course,"" and, as usual, no butter was served with our order ... and I had to ask for it a second time."
,,,,,"4. One in our party was having water to drink. Usually there are water glasses or water cups available near an urn of water in the restaurant. There were no cups available for the patrons, and I had to ask for a cup in which to drink the water."
,,,,,5. The restaurant was extremely cold. It's very seldom cold in Houston; however it was chilly today and the area where patrons dine was as cold as it was outside.  
,,,,,"6. Tables are not bussed timely. I can't tell you how many times we have taken a table that has not been wiped off. This is a very highly trafficked restaurant, and if management was on top of their game they would make sure that there was a person attending to the patron's floor at all times to immediately bus tables. Instead, the dining area pretty much looks like a pigsty."
,,,,,In summary:
,,,,,"The moral of my review is, ""Wonderful food, terrible service."" Buy their food and enjoy it at home. "
,,,,,"My opinion, and this is only my opinion, is that this is a symptom of their poor management having not implemented a quality system in addition to a lack of customer service training of their staff."
,,,,,I didn't have a good experience. The manager ended up refunding because the order was so wrong. This would be one thing but keep it mind they are also expensive for breakfast fare.
,,,,,Stopped in Common Bond Bistro for some dessert/baked goods.  Pretty busy around 8 on a Friday night.
,,,,,"A Bistro, Bakery that has a great variety of options.  We went with Cranberry Orange and Spiced Pear & Earl Grey (had to try) Scones.  Both were excellent with the Pear scone having a hint of spice.  "
,,,,,"Tried the Triple Chocolate Brown Butter Cookie based on the name and it lived up to the billing!  The Chocolate Caramel Paris Brest is a must try!  Pastry topped with Endless goodness of Chocolate Mousse, Caramel.  Didn't want this one to end!"
,,,,,"You have everything from a burger to Poutine, Shrimp Po-Boy, Duck Confit, Steak Frites and they also have breakfast and a coffee bar.   The choices are a bit overwhelming in a good way so this will take a few trips."
,,,,,"Friendly service throughout.  Will definitely be back for breakfast, lunch!"
,,,,,"Solid 4 here! Common bond has a great menu that is simple enough to easily make a decision without feeling overwhelmed. The food is cooked with care, although I have seen the portions change drastically over the last 2 years. My favorite meal is the French dip sandwich, the au jus sauce is the perfect balance and always very tasty. The desserts here are like no other! They have so many options, however, my favorite of all is the turtle brownie! The drink options are vast, but my favorite is the lavender latte (which is superb both hot and iced). The ONLY downfall I have to mention here is that because common bond is so dang busy all of the time, it's difficult to even place an order and have it ready in a timely manner, and I have found that when I order for pick up ahead of time, they always wait until I arrive to the restaurant before they ""realize"" I placed a drink order with the food and I have to wait there for nearly an addition 10 minutes before I can take my items and leave."
,,,,,"We frequent the Heights location pretty often food quality and service are both high. This location just wasn't hitting the mark. Both service and food quality is was low. French toast breakfast was cold, sent it back, upon return bacon was damn near raw. Asked if we could have crisper back and they sent us the most burnt up inedible pieces of bacon ever. Finally had to talk to the manager which I NEVER do. She seemed unbothered by the whole situation. She said she was going to return the charge to the card but I'm not sure that will actually happened. The food there costs too much to be executed so poorly next time we will take the extra 10 minutes to drive to the heights location or maybe one of the other great breakfast spots in the area like Brazil, Baby Barnabys or even Snooze."
,,,,,"""Don't mess with a man and his bacon.""  - Martin Luther King Jr....... I think."
,,,,,Wandered in one weekday morning for cappuccino but couldn't resist the macarons. Cappuccino I was surprised was so inexpensive at under $4 and was wonderful. The macarons where very cold and I'm not sure if that is normal or not but they tasted delightful. I had lavender and tiramisu flavor. Will be back when the line is shorter!

,,,,,"Jacob provides excellent service for me at the sushi bar.  Nice restaurant setting, more high-end than the average sushi spots.  Good variety of fish from kohada, aji, to kinmedai.  Bluefin toro, chu toro and akami.  Fresh Santa Barbara uni was a leaping portion for sushi, foie gras on my applications, I think I had most of them.  Would of like the Foie a bit more seasoned, the Foie sushi was a bit too cooked.  Everything was fast even though quite busy.  "
,,,,,"Shari was not up to par for this level of fish.  Rice quality should be tamanishiki , Tamaki gold or better, it was slightly too al dente for me, and was too cold, mostly it was unseasoned, no sushisu flavor.  It couldn't balance the fat content of fish.  Was a bit disappointed."
,,,,,"I got Foie since San Francisco doesn't, so extra star for that.  Shari 2 stars.  Overall I was happy and Jacobs service saved the day."
,,,,,"They have ups and downs. Some day everything was good, Some day even edamame is undercooked."
,,,,,My recent 2 visits;
,,,,,Sushi rice was cold and the sushi rice wasn't at the best condition.
,,,,,My server was lacking of in terms of knowledge and attentiveness.
,,,,,There kanpachi with Foie Gras is the best. I always order 2 dish.
,,,,,"I mean. Who doesn't love Kata?! I've come countless times throughout the years and I've never had a bad experience. Love the ambiance, service, and food overall. Def won't be stopping my visits here anytime soon."
,,,,,I walk in at 2:46 pm. Google says they are open till 10:30 pm. Hostess says they just took the last seating at 2:45 pm. Seems to me like there's more to that story.  That's my last visit to Kata Robata.
,,,,,Such amazing food and sweet service! I'm a self proclaimed Mac n cheese connoisseur and I give the lobster Mac n cheese a 10/10 so so dank and the Caribbean roll is chefs kiss!!
,,,,,"Love love love Kata Robata!!! If you love sushi, beef skewers, and eggplant you have to try this place out!! Don't forget to get a Sapporo beer, Sake, or a Leche Martini too! Fine dining and a great place to go to for date lunch or night out!"
,,,,,"I really missed sushi from Los Angeles. Sushi around Austin was a hit or miss, but the sushi here was absolutely divine! Everything was delicious, service was great, and food came out quickly. Definitely coming back if we're in Houston again."
,,,,,If you don't like money come here. As far as sushi and s Hashim I goes very limited and over priced. I left wanting to just go somewhere else. Probably double any place around. Got 2 stars just because what I had was ok. Not worth the hype.
,,,,,"Enjoyed dinner here during a weeknight. The dining room was crowded but that's expected when the sushi is so great! Parking is in a shared lot, which fills up quickly. Highly recommend trying the dessert if you can... banana crème brûlée was my choice but I avoided the chocolate and berry cream topping because it didn't really mesh well with the banana and brûlée base..."
,,,,,"Went here yesterday based on reviews.   Food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.  Bland.  Blah.  Eh."
,,,,,"We tried the bento box lunch and a trio of sushi rolls.  In the end, it's a one and done for us.  Nothing special"

,,,,,One of my all-time favorite spots to go to for fresh sushi I just can't get enough of this place
,,,,,"Made a reservation for 5 for 8:30pm. I got there around 8:20 and the wait was about an extra 30 minutes. Though the wait was long, the food made up for it. I'm not even going to pretend like I remember what the dishes are called but they were all really really good. If anything, just show the waiter the pictures ^_^"
,,,,,"The ambiance works with a group of friends or just for a date. The low light makes it a lot more intimate. However, it is pretty cold so bring a jacket."
,,,,,So incredibly disappointed today! Our family came in to visit and we made reservations in advance. Had checked before and they said they had gluten free options. We have members of our family with Celiac and at the time we were seated( which was 5:30) we were even willing to eat early as we have always loved it...when we asked to confirm...the waiter did a horrible job at letting us know that they announced last week that they stopped doing GF options due to supply chain issues. Ate at Uchi yesterday and they handled and entire chef's menu GF without question. If they had handled it nicer it would have been easier to swallow!
,,,,,"This was my first time in Houston and this was the first restaurant that I've dine at as well.  I was so impressed with the food here.  Japanese style tapas to sushi to Ramen, kata Robata nailed it all.  "
,,,,,The food and presentation is nothing but top.  Server knows their menu in and out and is always attentive 
,,,,,For sure a must visit when in Houston.
,,,,,"Let me start with saying I have been all over the world at the finest restaurants and this is certainly at the top of the list!!! This is real unique culinary experience!!! Everything is high quality prepared perfectly, we had a variety of the special rolls and sashimi, seaweed salad, razor clams, all I can say is it was amazing!!! 5 stars isn't enough!!!"
,,,,,"I've been waiting months to come here! My sister was visiting from out of town, so we made reservations the night before. Menu is kind of difficult to see since it's all through the phone. What we ordered:"
,,,,,"7 sushi and roll ($22 + $5 for king crab cali): Amazing deal that's part of their lunch. Great selection of nigiri, and i was quite surprised how good the king crab cali roll was - definitely worth the upgrade."
,,,,,"O-toro premium fatty bluefin tuna ($12 per piece): veryyyy fatty, and delicious. ate it before the wasabi arrived, which would've made it much tastier"
,,,,,Foie gras & scallop sushi ($17 for 2 pieces): BEST. THING. I. EVER. TASTED. it was melting in my mouth and had soooo much flavor. i would order this 1000x if i could afford it. 
,,,,,Wagyu sandos ($20): super super tender. so hearty and helps to get you full in combination with the sushi/sashimi
,,,,,"Big sushi eater and this place was delicious. Spent 60 bucks on a sushi meal, tonkotsu ramen, bento plate and a beer. Everything tasted so fresh."
,,,,,"My boyfriend and I stopped by for our anniversary dinner on our way home back to New Orleans from Austin. Made reservations for 6:30, got seated immediately and from then on we had probably one of the best dining experiences ever. Our server Anh was very friendly, knowledgeable and was a pleasure to interact with. Everyone was very helpful and made sure things went smoothly. As for the food.... omg let me just say... MUST GET: Kobe beef skewers, Yuzu marinated salmon sashimi, amberjack sashimi with foie gras, miso crusted bone marrow, miso Marinated black cod, otoro and Uni nigiri & green tea soufflé cheesecake!!!! "
,,,,,"EVERYTHING WAS MELT IN YOUR MOUTH, FINGERLICKING GOOD. I kid you not. FOR DRINKS definitely ask for the Summer Sunset... made and concocted by our amazing server actually. It's a refreshing oolong tea drink with notes of passion fruit & citrus with rum. Thank you Kata for the amazing experience.. ahh we will definitely be back again next time we're in town!!!"
,,,,,"So impressed by this place!! Definitely my favorite meal I've had in the times I have visited Houston. The sushi was sooo fresh, the lobster Mac and cheese was so dreamy and I have been waiting to try a wagyu katsu sand which and the flavors were insane!! Such a delicious meal, and the service was great. From the hosts, to server to food runners everyone was so friendly and made sure we were enjoying our meals. Can't wait to get back here and eat some more!"
,,,,,I had a great experience. Was told this was the spot to go to when driving through Houston. Service was great. She made excellent recommendations. I left fat and happy =)

,,,,,"This restaurant has such good reviews but our experience there was just bad. We came in on Saturday evening and the restaurant was pretty empty. The hostess was very polite and asked us to wait for a table which was fine since we didn't have a reservation. We got a couple of drinks at the bar which were pretty good and bartenders were very helpful and friendly. And that's where 'goodness' stops. We were seated and waited for about 40 min, no one came to greet us so we asked hostess to send us a server. When lady finally showed up she seemed irritated and was straight forward rude. We asked for recommendations she said that descriptions of items were self explanatory. I'm sorry but I don't know the names of ingredients they use and google each one of them is not something I'd like to do on a date night. Her attitude made me think that she had a problem with us specifically because table next to us got all the attention from her. She never came back check on us. The service we got was just horrible."
,,,,,"After craving sushi for a month, we decided to go there for the first time. The service in this place is amazing, not only are the servers friendly and nice, they are knowledgeable about Japanese food and give good recommendations. We got Salmon slices as appetizers which were tender and beautifully marinated. After that we ordered pieces based on their recommendations all of which were beautifully made and delicious. Someone in our table ordered  non seafood items and loved their beef skewers. We tried their lobster Mac and cheese too which was great, but not a typical choice for me as I do not want to fill up on Mac instead of good fish. Finally their tres leches dessert was probably the fluffiest and lightest tres leches I had tried. Easy to go down after a meal with low sugar."
,,,,,"We loved our experience and I absolutely recommend this place. My only cautionary thought is that this is a pretty expensive place (for a reason), so it might not be a weekly go-to sushi place."
,,,,,"Came here with my husband to celebrate a belated Christmas after (both working in the medical field, we worked the whole week of Christmas), it was the 26th. "
,,,,,The parking lot was jam packed. They had complimentary valet parking (but I'm cheap and never carry cash). Once we got inside there was a thirty minutes wait... which moved pretty fast. I believe we waited twenty minutes tops.
,,,,,"The ambiance was great, dim lighting, and wooden beamed ceilings and bar. New age wood. Just so you know there are several options which are gluten free as well as vegan. They take food allergies and diet, very serious and asked us if we had any preferences or allergies when we sat down. "
,,,,,"We ordered the rising star roll as an appetizer (which was refreshing and delicious), the spicy ramen (full of robust flavor), the hot pork plate, and the green tea cheesecake (spongy and light Japanese styled cheesecake with a dairy free creamy red bean ice cream) YUMMY. "
,,,,,I FOUND IT YA'LL. Can't wait to go back and try more.
,,,,,One of my fav places. Food is delicious.  IService is usually good and you get your food in 5-10 min.
,,,,,"One of the best dining experiences I've had in a few years. Don't be fooled by the exterior, very nice inside, should be a stand alone restaurant. The atmosphere was full of refined energy, the service was exceptional and the dishes did not disappoint. The Texas Kobe Beef skewers were heavenly, wonderfully flavorful and melted in your mouth. The Texas Wagyu Katsu Sando was not bad but paled in comparison to the Texas Kobe. The Miso Crusted Bone Marrow was a must try for uniqueness, not bad but different and you need coaching to eat or in terms of the sauce accompaniment. As we ordered family style, I don't remember some of the dishes but took pictures and they were delicious. We are from San Francisco and I would fly back to Houston just to dine at Kata Robata."
,,,,,We ended up here quite by accident and it was a very happy accident. We were celebrating our anniversary and my husband made us reservations at another restaurant. It was not quite what we expected so we bailed and were driving aimlessly wondering where we should eat instead. I remembered people recommended this place to me in the past and we were close so we stopped in. 45 minute wait for a table but there were 2 seats left at the sushi bar so we took those. 
,,,,,"Food - excellent. We ordered the Madai with Truffle and the Lobster and Crab Ramen off of the daily specials and the Spicy Tuna Roll, Texas Himachi Roll and Miso glazed Black Cod offbof the dinner menu. All of the sushi was fresh. The cod was my favorite - prepared to perfection. Nice and moist and flaky with crispy skin. The Lobster and Crab ramen was creamy and decadent with big pieces of lobster. The Texas Himachi Roll was the only dish that could have used some additional flavor. The waiter brought us a blueberry cake for desssert for our anniversary. Very nice of him. I thought I was full but we devoured the dessert. Not too sweet and was perfect with the Earl Gray ice cream. "
,,,,,Service - excellent. Our waiter was very nice and helpful. It was our forst time there so his knowledge of the menu was very helpful. Our water glasses were kept full. Our plates were cleared quickly. And he brought us a free dessert with candle to celebrate our anniversary. 
,,,,,Ambience - Very good. I read some other reviews that it was a little shabby but I found it to be very nice on the interior. It was a little bit loud so we did have to talk loudly to each other and my husband had a hard time hearing what the waiter was saying. Masks didn't help that either. 
,,,,,Temperature- I am always cold so I always bring a sweater with me to go out. I did put my sweater on when we first got yhere but was able to remove it halfway through the meal and was very comfortable with the temperature. 
,,,,,Price - it is on the pricey side but typical for good sushi.
,,,,,"I have really enjoyed every meal that I have ever had at Kata Robata. I have spent a lot of time at this restaurant over the years and I have never had a bad meal here. Chef Hori and I have had a number of conversations after each meal and he is such a kind Chef. Whose goal is to just make sure his guests are always happy and eating the most innovative and delicious food. His Food is simply some of the best quality sushi I have had. The atmosphere is really a special one that can be amazing for large groups or a couples dinner. Thirdly, they are very accommodating to us as It was a special event and they proved to be just fantastic in providing a special service"
,,,,,"This has become one of my favorite sushi restaurants to go to. I love the fresh quality sushi here. I came on 5/5/21, Wednesday, at 1pm to come celebrate a friend's recent engagement. She has never been here and thoroughly enjoyed her meal, especially the Texas Kobe beef which is just a fan favorite with its buttery meat quality. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. There's hardly any chewing needed. I also really love their salmon! The five different types of seaweed salad was unique but it's probably not something I would order again, some of it was a little bland. Lastly their green tea soufflé cheesecake was subtly sweet and a great way to round out our meal, I'll definitely order that again. The service and atmosphere is always so nice and great for any occasion. I look forward to trying many more of their dishes."
,,,,,"Overview-Top notch sushi. We enjoyed various items from steak skewers, grilled octopus, to the OToro tuna. The ambiance is average for a restaurant of this caliber. Service could have been better but may be a one off experience. "
,,,,,The two star discount is based solely on orginization/service. I can't say if our experience is a one off or this is typical. I also understand Covid has likely had an impact on staffing. 
,,,,,Our anecdotal experiance-
,,,,,"My wife and I love sushi. We choose Kata Robata for our anniversary celebration, it was a special night. When we arrived we were told the reservation for ourself and friends (party of 6) made a month ago was no where to be found and they had no room for us. After some frustrating discussion it was discovered that they marked the reservation for the wrong month. Room was found and we were seated. Service was attentive to the point what we felt rushed and were advised after approximately 80-90 minutes that we were eating into another parties time. This was rude and frankly unreasonable time expectation for a party of 6."
,,,,,Lobster Ramen was amazing. I've had quite a bit of ramen in my time and this is hands down at the top of my list. There was an aroma of flavors in every bite. I was impressed.

,,,,,"One of the best Japanese food restaurants in Houston, my wife and I eat hear regularly and always consistently good food."
,,,,,"It was our first time and can't believe we waited so long to finally dine here. Great to see they are enforcing social distancing and proper hygiene to allow guests to dine safely. The food was amazing. Bone marrow, salmon carpaccio, foie gras, and numerous Japanese nigiri. We'll definitely dine here again!"
,,,,,"Eh I use to love this place, we came not very dressed up and the server treated us horribly like we couldn't afford anything. I been here so many times. The food was really awful this time especially for the price. I'll have to retry again and see what I come up with. There are plenty of good sushi places around Houston area!"
,,,,,Great lunch experience!
,,,,,Server was knowledgeable and had great recommendations! We had the chefs tasting and only ended up not liking the lobster head. We also ordered the longhorn and Texas hamachi rolls. Super tasty!

,,,,,"A top-notched place for sushi. The presentation to the quality and service were awesome. Located in Upper Kirby, this place does get very crowded. Parking lot does get full and they also have valet for the restaurant if needed. "
,,,,,I loved every item that I tried from the miso crusted bone marrow. The flavors were spot on. The uni chanwanmushi was another favorite item. Really good quality uni. The Kobe beef skewers is also a must. The beef just melts off. 
,,,,,Service was friendly and quick. This place gets pretty crowded. The ambience is chill. You can dress up or down. Reservation is recommended but we didn't have one walking in and the wait was short. A great choice for dinner in town.
,,,,,"Don't to-go from this place, they don't place same quantity/quality compared to dining in. 6 pieces of thinly sliced salmon vs over 9 pieces that are thickly sliced. For this item that is highly priced, one would expect to get what is paid for. If you want high quality sushi with thickly sliced pieces, you guys might want to check out teppay on westheimer. All their pieces are thickly sliced, high quality...and HALF THE PRICE."
,,,,,"omg I love this place! Their sushi and small sharable plates are so so good. The place is a bit dark but the booth seating are comfortable with lights, dinner vibes interior and the service was good."
,,,,,"We went in happy hour which we were able to get the longhorn roll and spider roll for half price. We also got spicy salmon roll, vegan gyoza, fried brussel sprouts, fresh catch ceviche, and miso lobster mac n cheese. I really liked all of the items we ordered, miso lobster mac n cheese as my favorite one, longhorn roll was so delicious as well as the fresh catch ceviche and vegan gyoza. "

Very great team Kata Robata has!! All dishes were delicious and pretty presentation. Hot green tea was very tasty as well. Thank you Kata Robata! See y'all soon.
,,,,,"Quality, quality, quality. Very special. Sashimi for 2 is always super fresh and offers an amazing selection and value as well. Coin toss with MF sushi for my fav sushi restaurant in houston, but kata offers more 'flexibility' (hours) and a bit better value. Wonderful and attentive wait staff. There is a reason they stay busy all the time and the place well deserves it. Also very glad to see some management changes/improvements. Keep up the good work."
,,,,,Spontaneously decided to try this place as we were driving around to find somewhere to eat for dinner. We came on a Monday night around 7 and the wait was only about 15mins which is nice since reservations are highly recommended. The oysters were delicious and left us wanting to order more. The kobe beef skewers were sooooooo soft and flavorful. The hamachi and jalapeño sashimi was ok. It didn't really stand out compared to other sushi restaurants that serve it for half the price. The ocean roll was veryy good and rolled beautifully. We got the green tea cheesecake and the cheesecake was very soft but not as sweet as I'd like. Buttttt the red bean ice cream that came with it was very sweet and very good. I wish I could've ordered just the ice cream by itself!
,,,,,"1st: To the previous customers who wrote 1 star because they didn't think they didn't have time to eat or someone was rude. Please do not return. Giving a 1 star for 1 problem is not cool. But! On the bright side, this allows more space for me to return! :)"
,,,,,"The food, service and staff were amazing!!!"
,,,,,I am new regular. 
,,,,,"Order: King Lobster roll, Duck Breast Ramen. All freshly prepared, huge shout out to the kitchen. "
,,,,,"Staff: Edward was great! Very knowledgeable and friendly, he made the restaurant feel like home. Thanks Edward!"
,,,,,"Went here for a nice Saturday evening dinner, I called ahead and asked for a table for two and the host told me that she would hold me a table as I was only 10 minutes away. When I arrived i was told there are no tables left and it would be a 30-45 min wait. I asked if we can sit at the sushi bar and we got sat immediately. Our server was incredible, probably some of the best service I have received in some time now. The sushi chef was also very nice and helped with our selection. We ordered the wagyu sticks, some king crab, pork belly and other various pieces including the scallop and foie gras . "
,,,,,"The wagyu was delicious, cooked just right and with just the right amount of glaze on it. "
,,,,,The pork belly was yummy and tender but just a little too heavy for me which I expected 
,,,,,"The peppered tuna was very fresh and flavorful with just the right amount of pepper , so was the salmon. "
,,,,,We ordered a roll as well which I didn't care for much. 
,,,,,Overall a great experience and can't wait to go back
,,,,,"Kata robata is THE place to go for fresh, quality fish in Houston. We got chirashi, which had toro, salmon, Madai, unagi, hamachi, and an assortment of other fish. The toro was excellent quality, melt in your mouth buttery flavor. The Longhorn roll and toro rolls were also really tasty. Other dishes we ordered included butterfish and the grilled octopus. Butterfish was pretty average for a good Japanese restaurant, but octopus was so soft and tender and the sauce it came with complemented the food well! I've also tried the yuzu salmon dish and fish&fish hamachi collar, both which are excellent. Overall, can't go wrong with takeout or dine in here!"
,,,,,"The meal is an experience. This takes sushi to an entirely new level. We ordered the Kobe beef skewers to start- top 2 cuts of beef I've had in my life. Omakase for the meal, which was a mix of nigiri and sashimi with fresh Japanese fish options, and then a banana crepe brûlée to top it all off. For drinks we had the lychee martini and the sashito mojito. Best sushi I've ever had and it was great trying new fish you can't get at most places with the Omakase. We can't wait to return and try some of their rolls."
,,,,,"I must say this place is fancy , pricey (but it's worth every penny), bathrooms have the Japanese toilets which is an experience LOL!but getting into the food ,house made lemonade, Kobe beef skewers wide selection of sushi (I will highly recommend yellow tail and Toro.), great rolls as Texas Hamachi and the ocean picante. This is hands down top rated sushi restaurant in Houston in my book :)"
,,,,,Love this place the beef sandwich is so good! Also love the steam egg with goose liver. The only thing we don't recommend is the cold noodle.

,,,,,"If you've never been here before go!! I will be back to try everything else on the menu. No disappointment, believe the hype."
,,,,,Hands down one of the best places to eat sushi in Houston! Totally worth the money. The quality of the fish and other ingredients are top notch! They have great lunch specials and some of the most amazing sushi rolls I have ever had.
,,,,,TLDR; Food poisoning in two separate orders of the DIY handroll kits. Avoid at all costs. 
,,,,,"I wanted badly to write a positive review for Kata Robata. I've dined in on a few occasions and usually only have good things to say about the fish; most of the other small plates or hot dishes are also quite good. My Sunday dinner, however, was drastically different. My party of 4 ordered two sets of the DIY handroll takeout kits, each of which comes with 10 sheets of nori, rice, tempura crunch, spicy mayo, avocado, cucumber/jalapeno strips, and fish (tuna (akami), toro, yellowtail, shrimp, and salmon). For only ~60$ for a two-person kit, it definitely isn't a bad deal, as the amount of fish is pretty generous for that price point (though I wish they provided a little more rice)."
,,,,,"The surprise, however, came after when all 4 of us got severe food poisoning. Considering it was from a place established (and expensive) Kata Robata, where the fish typically tastes quite fresh, I was extremely surprised and disappointed. There's no discerning if it was just something in the fish, or if it hadn't been kept at the proper temperature, or if it was due to sanitation issues at Kata Robata, but during COVID, the possibility of contracting any type of illness from food (and paying 60$ to do so), isn't worth the risk of dining here again and figuring it out. Because this place really has impressed me in the past, I'd be willing to visit again later on, but I would really recommend staying away for the time being."
,,,,,I guess this is why people say not to eat sushi on Sundays :(
,,,,,"I've heard amazing things about Kata Robata so I went in with high expectations. First off, I love a dark ambiance especially for dinner which is what Kata has. Our waiter was also very attentive and checked on us often. Food wise, I wouldn't say that it lived up to the hype per say but I would definitely come back. The sushi was great quality and the vibes were nice. I highly recommend the first roll in the picture, with white fish and Serrano. Not sure of the name!"
,,,,,"Took my wife and son here to celebrate his birthday and truly enjoyed the experience. Our server was excellent, and the sashimi, robata grill, and rolls were fresh, tasty, and overall excellent. We stuck to the classic sashimi and nigiri and tried almost every fish item on the menu. They gave my son a matcha green tea cake to celebrate his birthday, which was nice and truly appreciated. Will be coming back."
,,,,,"My wife and I came here for a date night.  We shared the mixed ceviche, kobe skewers, and pork gyoza.  She had the Longhorn maki, and I had nigiri sushi (salmon, yellowtail, and chopped scallop).  The mixed ceviche was the best thing we ordered: the leche de tigre was good, and we liked the combination of octopus and white fish.  The kobe beef was tender and delicious, so I'd also recommend that.  However, we really came to order sushi, but we weren't impressed by either the maki or the nigiri sushi.  All the food prices were high.  At least the ceviche and the kobe were tasty.  The sushi wasn't anything special, so we didn't think it was worth the price tag."
,,,,,Came here on a Friday evening to celebrate the boyfriend's birthday and really enjoyed our visit here! 
,,,,,"I was able to easily make a reservation online and upon walking in, we were quickly seated. Throughout our meal, our table was cleared and our waters were filled frequently. Our waiter also checked up on us multiple times and was very polite"
,,,,,"We started off with the Texas Kobe beef skewers and foie gras and duck cold soba. The beef skewers were so juicy and flavorful! It had a perfect sear on the outside and was tender on the inside. The cold soba noodles were great after the skewers. The vinaigrette helped break down the fattiness of the beef from before and was very refreshing. However, we found the duck breast to be a bit tough and chewy. "
,,,,,"Their menu on the first page had daily specials and we decided to try out their Hokkaido scallop sushi. It came with a big piece of scallop and was so soft and buttery! We also shared the sushi platter which came with 10 pieces of sushi and a side of your choice of tuna or salmon roll. The platter had a great variety of the chefs pick and was all very fresh and delicious. We especially liked the otoro, yellowtail, unagi, and ikura! "
,,,,,"Since it was my boyfriends birthday, they also gave us free dessert! He picked the green tea  soufflé which came with red bean ice cream. It was a great way to end the meal and was not too heavy at all. I also really liked the grounded Black sesame powder that the ice cream sat on top of! It added a nice texture and nuttiness to the desert. "
,,,,,"Overall, we really enjoyed our meal here and would definitely come again! The menu is large and can satisfy everyone, whether or not they like raw fish or not. Although it is a bit more pricey, it is definitely worth it as you get amazing quality food and service!"
,,,,,"Everything during our dinner was spot-on. We started off with the shishito peppers, which weren't as spicy as we would generally prefer, but the kimchi aioli was a great way to bring out a more unique flavor profile for the peppers. The miso crusted bone marrow was one of the highlights of the night. Each side topping or accompaniment that was given paired perfectly with the bone marrow to balance out all of the flavors. We finished off with a variety of nigiri, including some amazing o-toro and wagyu a5 that was among the best we've ever had. And the portions for all of these items were more than generous. Top that all off with the very fast and friendly service we received and I would say this is definitely an experience we're looking forward to having again."
,,,,,"A few things standout, not in a good way. The cut and execution. The taste profile of their so called ""creative"" dishes. And the overall cleanliness of the establishment (or the lack there of). "
,,,,,The cut and execution: 
,,,,,"The standard cut of flat cut sashimi should be approximately 10mm thick, but Kata Robata offers a sub 5mm cut at best. That's a 50% reduction that reduces the both texture and taste of the fish... not to mention they sell it at standard cut pricing (premium too). "
,,,,,The execution of the nigiri is revolving sushi bar quality at best. Requiring a subtle brush of tamari on top of the fish is too much to ask because apparently they won't even wipe wasabi underneath or even cook the rice right. 
,,,,,"The ""creative"" dishes: "
,,,,,"Throwing ingredients like greens or taro chips or jalapeño and the like on top of too-thinly cut subpar cuts of sashimi with store bought sauces and condiments drizzled on top is by no means creative. It's purpose is only two fold: to get rid of subpar cuts, and to overcharge for otherwise inexpensive ingredients. It is only okay if taste surpasses other factors. The flavor profiles here are bland, elementary, and cliche. "
,,,,,Cleanliness: 
,,,,,"If a sushi restaurant's cleanliness is even a topic of discussion, that's an immediate red flag. Kata Robata  should consider getting into the flags business with its greasy floors, sticky armrests, and grungy corners. "
,,,,,There are two stars ONLY because the freshness of their seafood selections are surprising. But unfortunately that should be a prerequisite for all upscale sushi restaurants.
,,,,,Hands down my favorite place for sushi and not to mention the mac & cheese . From sushi to ramen to mac & cheese you will definitely find something for everyone here. The cocktails are also a refreshing. I can go on and on . You must try.  Tell them Johnny Mambo sent you.

,,,,,"Everything was made to perfection! For about $60 a person, we got the full experience. From the skewers to the cheesecake, everything was amazing! The sashimi was fatty, fresh and prepared well. The sushi did not have too much rice, the fish was super fresh and the other toppings in the roll complimented each other so well! Everyone in my group left extremely satisfied! Service was quick and super friendly! We had to wait 2 hours to be seated (put our name down at 6:30pm for 6 people) but other than that, I would say it was a perfect experience!"
,,,,,"Food tastes great, I would say the tapas are the go to. Sushi and nigiri are just ok for the premium price- nothing too significant."
,,,,,"My partner and I really enjoyed our experience! This place was popping on a Thursday evening and we got there right at 5pm. Service was good food was awesome! I attached individual reviews with the pictures. We got everything we wanted, was full, and spent ~$160, which is pretty reasonable for the quality of the food! Huge fan of the Foie Gras & Duck Chawanmushi and the banana creme brûlée. There were several layers of flavors that gave those dishes more depth. Definitely will come back to try some other menu items! Glad I found the uchi/uchiko alternative!"
,,,,,This pains me to write this but also curious to know if others are experiencing the same. Kata has always been my go to and favorite sushi restaurant but the quality and service has been declining in my opinion. It has taken me a few more visits and curbside orders to finally write this review. 
,,,,,The rolls I ordered for curbside were less than fresh. See pics. I also parked in the curbside pickup and sat there for 10 minutes thinking my order wasn't ready (the curbside pickup clearly states to wait for your order to be brought out). I finally decided to go in and find 3 hostesses standing there chatting and my order had probably been sitting on the table the whole time. Had I known or been instructed to come in I could've saved that time. 
,,,,,"Our last visit we ordered the shrimp sashimi with fried heads. Not an unusual order...you should try it. However the server brought the ""presentation"" out without the fried heads and told us to take the sashimi off the plate and they would take the heads back to fry. ?? This has never happened in the past. Typically they bring it all out together. Strangely odd so we asked the manager if this is new. He seemed clueless and unapologetic and inexperienced."
,,,,,The bento boxes we ordered for lunch were eh. The ramen was consistently good but I would be extremely concerned if they messed that up. Overall I still love Kata and will continue to give it another try but the last 3 times have really been different. Hopefully they were exceptions to the usual good food and service.
,,,,,"I came on Thursday last week and could have sworn I scheduled a reservation, they weren't able to find it but they were still able to accommodate us which I was very grateful for. We sat at the sushi bar and received wonderful service from everyone we encountered. Calvin waited on us and made great recommendations. He was not only knowledgeable but very kind and patient. He made a great selection of nigiri and sashimi for us. I'm always blown away by the service and quality of the food."
,,,,,pretty good!!  loved the service but food was just pretty ok a little pricey for quality
,,,,,tropical tuna roll: 3.8/5
,,,,,longhorn:4/5
,,,,,spicy soy ramen: 4.1/5
,,,,,chocolate bread pudding: 4.2/5
,,,,,Let me start off by letting you know that Katie Velez was a great server. She made sure that we were comfortable and ready to take our order. When we walked in automatically greeted as it should be always. We love this place for the food and ambience. Social distancing rules enforced as well as mask which was great. This day we wanted to try the Wagyu sando which we've heard only great things about it. They also have a lobster version on the menu. Since they have real Japanese Wagyu we had to get some of that before we left. As a dumpling lover I had to try the Wagyu Shumai as well. If you haven't had Japanese Wagyu you are missing out. La pièce de résistance was the Wagyu nigiri that just melts in your mouth. Our final item was dessert. We ordered the banana crème brûlée with extra Nutella foam. This place has been in my top restaurants choices for years now.
,,,,,"I love this place, best Mac and cheese in town. Sushi and sashimi is on point with taste and price. "
,,,,,"However, this last visit the quality of the cocktails and desserts was disappointing. The Shishito mojito seemed like mainly mixer, and did not come with the pepper garnish as usual. Also, we ordered the blueberry cake to go, and it did not come with the earl grey ice cream. When I ordered the cake at the table, the server even asked whether I wanted ice to keep the ice cream cold. I asked why there was no ice cream and was told that the to go order does not include it?? "
,,,,,I spent more than $250 dollars for 2 people and can't get a scoop of ice cream :(
,,,,,"I brought my whole family from Louisiana to try Kata for Fathers Day and i can say it was a huge disappointment. Everything looks presentable, but lacked taste. Even my all time favorite Scallop with Foie Gras lacked flavor. Uni tasted fishy. Not only did i feel this way, my whole family had the same impression. Quality wasn't the same since the last time i went with friends. Our server was very polite and helped ordering a lot easier!"
,,,,,The chef sushi was fresh and juicy. Wonderful service and great food. You may want to make reservation to avoid waiting in line.

,,,,,"Absolutely amazing from beginning to end. Stellar customer service. The food came out fast. Our sender Kahn was the BEST! He was so attentive but not too attentive so it was perfect. He gave us time with the menu and described items perfectly. I give this establishment ! We started off with the scallop dish off of the daily specials menu - the scallops were huge and melted like butter in my mouth. The caramelized onion foam and the purée all in one bite with it was so good. This is a tasty dish. Then we did the rising Sun specialty roll. Very good as well. Fresh fish, delicate presentation. Simple and very decadent. We tried the spicy miso ramen and the broth was to die for. I loved it all. I will definitely be going back and I hope I get Kahn again as my server . I have found a new favorite place to go here in Houston. The atmosphere was very nice and the music was the perfect volume to enjoy my dinner with my family. Very good job guys. Thank you for a great experience."
,,,,,Great sushi spot that we love coming to! Fish is always fresh and love the options they have for both lunch and dinner! Be ready to spend quite a bit but it is totally worth the delicious fish and the service. 
,,,,,Will definitely be coming back to Kata Robata many times!
,,,,,"Everything we ordered was amazing! 3 girls spurlged on a nice dinner and left extremely full. That night, unfortunately, they did run out of Foie Gras. SERVICE was on spot. Our water glasses were always filled and the food came out in a timely manner. "
,,,,,COLD 
,,,,,"- KATA FRESH CATCH MIXED CEVICHE ($15): BEAUTIFUL presentation, the taro chips added a nice crunch texture to the dish "
,,,,,"- HAMACHI & JALAPENO SASHIMI ($15): 6 pieces of hamachi, very citrusy. The LEAST MEMORABLE dish but still delicious "
,,,,,HOT 
,,,,,"- MISO CRUSTED BONE MARROW ($16): Pleasantly surprised because it was a bigger serving than we thought it was, served with a side of crusty bread. We needed more bread but forgot to ask for it. Very RICH & BUTTERY "
,,,,,"- MISO MARINATED BLACK COD ($18): About FIST SIZED, mild fish flavor but so SOFT & FLAKEY. Can't go wrong with black cod. It's almost always delicious "
,,,,,"- MISO LOBSTER MAC & CHEESE ($19): Oh my lord this was one of my favorite dishes! Big chunks of lobsters, 3 different types of cheese, and the miso adds this addictive UMAMI flavor. Seriously I would get this every single time I come to Kata "
,,,,,- TEXAS KOBE BEEF SKEWERS ($18): The order comes with 2 skewers and each skewer has 3 MELT IN YOUR MOUTH pieces of beef 
,,,,,SUSHI 
,,,,,- SAKE / NEW ZEALAND KING SALMON ($4/$6): I believe each order comes with 2 pieces so we did 2 orders of each. The salmon was fresh and high quality. The King salmon in comparison had more fatty marbling so it was softer. You can see in the photos. 
,,,,,- CHU TORO ($10): Medium fatty tuna
,,,,,- SPICY CHOPPED SCALLOP ($4)
,,,,,- UNI ($9): Sea urchin isn't everyone's cup of tea but it's literally the OCEAN'S BUTTER. Good uni gives you this clean briny sea flavor that is so refreshing. Uni doesn't taste good everywhere but Kata definitely has good uni 
,,,,,SPECIALS
,,,,,"- UNI PASTA ($35): My other favorite dish! The noodles were al dente, the sauce was DECEDENT, CREAMY, & SAVORY. It was just an amazing experience. 5/5 would definitely get this again"
,,,,,"For drinks, we had the KOKONATSU LYCHEE ($11). We were so full we couldn't order dessert but I know their desserts are amazing. The next time I come back I'm definitely gonna have all the Foie Gras dishes since I missed out of them this time."
,,,,,"This restaurant is just amazing. Every single bite tastes like heaven, specially the Sushi or Sashimi. The ramen, the best one. I literally loved everything."
,,,,,Wagyu katsu sando : tasty but not that impressed
,,,,,Sushi platter : their seaweed used in rolls is well seasoned and fragrant. amazing! All sushi pieces were really satisfying - literally melts in your mouth
,,,,,Salmon + black truffle + quail egg : not that impressed
,,,,,Nagasaki Champon ramen : broth is really good!! Plenty seafood in there - next time would request to cut ginger topping in half
,,,,,"Phenomenal experience. Having lived in Japan and having had exceptional sushi, I can say I was pleasantly surprised by the freshness and quality of their food. I'm more a nigiri  fan, but we ordered a roll first and it when it came out and tasted it, we ordered another one. Fantastic, delicious, please go and try them out. I'd recommend making a reservation as we got extremely lucky getting there right before they got busy and the wait time can easily reach 45min to an hour on the weekend."
,,,,,"If you're from LA, Vegas, or really anywhere on the west coast that gets the freshest, best, bombest sushi, you will not like the sushi here. Go to Uchi, that's more comparable to what we get back west. You're welcome."
,,,,,This place is hands down one of the best sushi spot in town! I am a true fan! Fresh made ingredients daily and made to perfection. Customer service is excellent! I've tend to over order but why not? You can't go wrong with any on the menu.
,,,,,"Kata Robata rarely disappoints me. The interior is really cozy and chic. Our server is super friendly, professional and knowledgeable. He recommended a lot of good stuff. I love foie gras here. Doesn't smell weird like other restaurants I've had. Uni is rich and flavorful. I don't really care for the rolls tbh. Omakase was standard. I had the matcha cheesecake for dessert and it was bomb! A++ for the food decoration. Would love to go back and try new things on the menu."
,,,,,I have been here a couple of times however this time I walked-in craving ramen during lunch. Compared to other Japanese sushi/grill restaurants their lunch menu is quite long giving the consumer tons of options. We were fortunate to have a great waitress in Kaylyn (sorry I know miss typed it). She was great I asked a ton of questions and she was extremely professional and knowledgeable of the menu. The east coast oysters with caviar were small compared to some gulf oysters I have seen this season but nonetheless you can never go wrong with oysters and caviar together.

,,,,,"Finally tried Kata Robata after so many recommendations, and it did not disappoint.  Had really good service and good food, and the ambiance was great.  Definitely cannot wait to come back to try their other items!  Also, it seems as if the menu changes seasonally."
,,,,,We had the following:
,,,,,Texas Wagyu Katsu Sando
,,,,,Lobster Mac
,,,,,Kobe Beef Skewers
,,,,,Miso Crusted Bone Marrow
,,,,,Japanese Amberjack Sashimi with Foie Gras
,,,,,Hamachi Kama
,,,,,Make reservations! The ambience is amazing the bartender is great. The food was good!
,,,,,Went here to celebrate my friends birthday and so glad they accept reservations for 12 people. My waiter was super awesome and patience. We didn't know want to order and he gave a lot of great recommendations. I order several items that contain foie gras:
,,,,,1. Foie Gras & duck appetizer was excellent every spoon just melts in your month.
,,,,,2. Amberjack Sashimi w Foie Gras. Waiter said to roll the fish around the Foie Gras and it was so good.
,,,,,3. Foie Gras & Scallop Sushi. We ordered enough for everyone to try one and this was everybody's favorite.
,,,,,We ordered a lot of other different items but the Texas Kobe beef skewers also deserve a special shout out. It was so tender and full of flavors and just melts in your mouth. It comes w 4 cubes but so worth it. Wish I've taken more photos of the food but we were too excited to eat the food.
,,,,,Delicious food. I was so impressed. This is one of my bf and I's fav places to eat. I recommend this place for sure.
,,,,,"Food was good. We got the sashimi plate for 2 and the lobster mac and cheese and that was plenty for 2. We left full and happy. We liked everything in the sashimi platter expect the raw shrimp. Mac and cheese was good too. I'm not a huge mac and cheese or lobster person but I did enjoy this. It is very heavy though. It was very busy and the server didn't check on us much and wasn't very attentive. I had to ask another random server to give me a new water because mine had a fly in it and it took to long for our assigned server to come back and check on us. It was good quality but I've had the same quality sushi in less expensive places with better service. I'd go back for lunch when it's hopefully less busy but I'd probably skip out for dinner. We went for a birthday dinner and they didn't ask what our occasion was or anything. I think if they were less busy or they had more servers it would help them be able to give their guests the attention they deserve and get a 5 star rating. Overall, I recommend for the food but don't expect the most attentive service."
,,,,,Kata is literally my top sushi place to go to in Houston. I've been going here for years and they never disappoint! Every time I've gone I literally get all these dishes and spend $$$ but it's worth it. 
,,,,,"The bone marrow with uni and ikura was a special they had for a few months, but they've taken it off their menu now. However their miso bone marrow is just as good!"
,,,,,"The wagyu shumai is still on the menu currently, but I prefer the pork shumai over the wagyu one though. "
,,,,,Their lobster sando just melts in your mouth. The sando bread is so buttery and tasty. Their wagyu sando is also delicious but it can be a little heavy.
,,,,,"The Japanese amberjack, yuzu salmon, hamachi w/ jalapeños and uni king crab spoon are definitely my go to favorites here. I have to always get these dishes no matter what!"
,,,,,My favorite dessert by them is the green tea cheesecake with the red bean ice cream. I can't handle a lot of sweet food and this dessert it perfect! It's not too sweet and just the right amount of green tea flavor. Definitely have to try if you like green tea!
,,,,,This is now my favorite and go to spot. Their duck with cold soba noodles is full of flavor and will be my usual order. You must try the foie gras on top of a scallop sushi! Their salads are vibrant and full of flavor. Almost anything you order here won't fail you. Their service is great and they make sure you truly taken care of.
,,,,,"Love the sushi and love when they have Kobe beef, Wagyu beef."
,,,,,Nice atmosphere and excellent service
,,,,,Kata Robata is one of my favorite sushi places! Their sushi always tastes fresh as well as their other menu items. Their ramen is also so good! Broth js really flavorful! If you're into salads I recommend the house salad with miso dressing. It's a pretty big salad and can be shared. Service is always great and staff is friendly. I will add that it's recommended to make reservations or you will be on the waitlist for hours. If you're craving sushi or Japanese cuisine this is the place to go!
,,,,,"The quality of ingredients and care in the execution is what sets Kata Robata apart from the rest. This was the Sashimi Bento box lunch special with sashimi slices, agadashi tofu, seaweed salad and California roll. I opted out of the chicken serving and asked for more agadashi tofu-- which is well executed and delicate with each bite. Who knew clean eating can be so yummy."

,,,,,A nice upscale restaurant to eat in the daytime. The quality of the food was great but not as good I was expecting it to be for the price.
,,,,,"What stood out the most for me here was the indoor atmosphere... beautiful.. dark, romantic, intimate.. I loved it, the outside appearance wasn't anything special, but worth it. The food was good, the sushi was ok, but the wagu sandos  take my purse. Delicious! Melt in your mouth. The pho was delicious as well. Must try."
,,,,,"Walking in, your greeted by a sweet host wearing a mask. We had reservations so we where guided to our table right away. "
,,,,,"The vibe is lovely, modern yet homey and sweet. Beautiful buzz of chatter in the background yet your still able to hold a conversation from across your table. "
,,,,,Now the food! Just spectacular. 
,,,,,My absolutely favorites :
,,,,,The tropical roll
,,,,,The yuzu salmon 
,,,,,We ordered the whole menu every item was delish! I'd fly back to Tx just to visit
,,,,,The food and service was amazing! Our favorite of the night was the Wagyu Sando. It was one of the most tender and flavorful piece of meat we have ever eaten! The Yuzo Salmon was a very close second. 
,,,,,"Having said that, we tried the Lobster Sando and the lobster was a tad overdone and chewy. The flavor was there but it may have just been a missed. "
,,,,,Overall a great eats!!! I was a happy customer!
,,,,,It's one of the top 5 go to sushi in Houston. Very consistent and great fresh dishes.
,,,,,"One of my favorite sushi places really good sushi, the steak bites great taste a bit pricey but really good sushi."
,,,,,"wow amazing flavors.  best wagyu katsu sando. texas knows their meats, so soft and savory.  perfect melting with milk bread but is a bit thick bread to be able to bite.  "
,,,,,"Uni and Black Truffle Soba: buckwheat soba, fried taro chips, oyster mushroom, black truffle, sea urchin, uni foam, wasabi vinaigrette-- flavors again combining very well and perfect mixing of textures.  same with yuzu marinated salmon--roasted cauliflower mousse was a great touch.  toro good and texas hamachi roll tiny, compact but also good.  great dessert tres leches crossed with strawberry shortcake, so less liquidity than traditional tres leches. had good service"
,,,,,And they just earned a star because everything tonight was spectacular. The standouts were the shumai with the injectable ponzu and the miso eggplant with the grilled rice. Like wow. Everything was really good. They seemed a little busy but it ended up being a well paced meal and let me tell you the bussers were on point today. Water was always full and the table was always clean.
,,,,,"We were the first ones there for happy hour and they opened their doors promptly at five. The restaurant was absolutely freezing. We had to ask to sit outside. Then again, it's summer in Texas so what can you expect besides businesses putting their"
,,,,,"AC on snow in August.  We indulged in the happy hour menu with the yuzu salmon carpaccio, the agedashi tofu, and the Brussels sprouts.  The salmon was on point, perfectly balanced with texture and flavor. The tofu was soupy and soft and maybe there was a touch too much broth but still tasty. The Brussels sprouts were disappointing. They had failed to cook them while halved in a pan to get all of the water out. They were too thick and too filled with moisture for crispy Brussels sprouts.  Probably not going to get that again. We also got the fish on fish which was really tender and tasty with an excellent pairing sauce. The ramen was not the best to me because the noodles should have been chewier and the broth more savory. Otherwise the entire meal summed up was pretty quality and always tasty as Kata Robata usually is. "
,,,,,Update: Also went there for lunch today and had the lobster Mac and cheese and the shumai. Both were unbelievably delicious. Like seriously best mac and cheese in town. Wow.
,,,,,"We were the first ones there for happy hour and they opened their doors promptly at five. The restaurant was absolutely freezing. We had to ask to sit outside. Then again, it's summer in Texas so what can you expect besides businesses putting their"

,,,,,"For a person who is basically new to sushi and Japanese food in general, I really loved the experience here! "
,,,,,We ordered:
,,,,,-Wagyu skewers: these were very juicy and delicious-- this is a MUST here! 
,,,,,"-Wagyu sliders: also yummy and juicy, the bread and panko add a nice buttery flavor and crunch to this, but we preferred the skewers"
,,,,,"-Caribbean roll: great flavor. This was my first semi-""raw"" dish, and the raw tuna was perfectly fine, not very fishy. I loved the fried lobster in this "
,,,,,"-Lobster Mac and cheese: this was by far my favorite dish here! Soo cheesy, delicious, full of flavor, with a tad of sweetness. Plenty of lobster, and not an overwhelmingly cheesy taste, which I'm usually picky about. I would come here again just for this! "
,,,,,-Blueberry cake: this (or any dessert of your choosing I would assume) was complimentary for us since it was his birthday. It came with earl grey ice cream. It had a nice blueberry flavor and was crumbly. Yummy but I'd probably try something else next time
,,,,,"The service was phenomenal-- they were prompt about refilling water and cleaning up the table between plates, and the waitress that serviced us was extremely informative and helpful! Nice ambience, smallish portions though for the price. "
,,,,,Would come again!
,,,,,"We were celebrating my boyfriend's birthday. We have had only one other experience where we enjoyed eating sushi in Houston and that was Uchi. This place was just as good! Service from Thai also made it even better. We thoroughly enjoyed the Texas roll with the hamachi, smoked salmon with yuzu, wagyu sando, lobster mac n cheese and green tea cheesecake. I know it may seem odd to order mac n cheese at a Japanese restaurant but it was only $20 and so it was worth it. Only gripe would that they should use a cavatappi pasta IMO. The only thing I regretted ordering was the Kakuni pork, it was meh. Presentation for all dishes were beautiful. It's pretty loud here, kinda felt like I was back in Vegas (not a bad thing at all just for those who want a quiet intimate dinner, you won't get that here)."

,,,,,"My boyfriend and I went last and had delicious food and drinks! The place is cute inside and I highly recommend reservations due to its limited size. The roll was delicious and well made. The wagyu bites, chicken skewers and spicy pork gyoza were amazing."
,,,,,"Always a solid option in the area for robata, sushi, cocktails, noodles, and more.  We had a variety of dishes, but I'll recommend the lobster and crab ramen. Rich and flavorful with chunks of lobster and crabmeat, I loved this dish so much I order plain noodles to go and boxed up leftover broth to eat for lunch at home the next day."
,,,,,"Went for my birthday! The wagyu skewers were my first time trying wagyu beef and they were so, so melt-in-your-mouth buttery, rich, and flavorful. The Shishito mojito was my first ever drink (!!) and was flavorful, punchy, and a great recommendation from the server."
,,,,,"The sashimi bowl had a fantastic assortment, and every cut of fish was so fresh and was everything I expected from a high end place, for a surprisingly affordable price! The dessert of red bean ice cream and green tea souffle cheesecake was so creamy, and the hot with the cold was a party for the taste buds."
,,,,,"Also, loved the naturally lit seating area at the back of the restaurant!"
,,,,,The ramen is some of the best I've had. The broth is so flavorful. It has the right amount of fat and pork flavor but still was light. We loved the freshness and brightness of the sushi. All of it was top notch. Some of the best Houston has to offer. They are too rated for a reason. Service was great. Sushi came out fairly fast even though there was a full house.
,,,,,"Must be dressed to the nines or you get REJECTED at the door ... I went on a week night and the condescending hostess looked at me up and down and said ""we don't have anything available."" ..."
,,,,,Every dish excels. Difficult to choose between Uchi and Kata Robata (we rotate).
,,,,,"Ocean Picante is an excellent signature roll. Nice spice, just enough crunch, layers of flavor."
,,,,,Papaya salad is a nice light plate topped with excellent grilled pork.
,,,,,Lobster and crab ramen can soothe your soul.
,,,,,Lobster mac and cheese is delicious and great portion size for sharing.
,,,,,Green tea souffle cheesecake is an airy dessert paired well with red bean ice cream. Great flavor and texture without being overly sweet.
,,,,,"Hands down, favorite spot for sushi in Houston. Quality of the fish is amazing with lots of rotating seasonal offerings. I tend to go for the sashimi for 2 which allows for a mix of fish each time I go. Spot prawns were available this past time I went and were amazing! Would recommend making a reservation before coming as wait times can be very long without one"
,,,,,Great sushi and amazing service. Everything we ate was above expectations. We will definitely be going back.
,,,,,3 days out and I'm STILL thinking about how delicious the food was 
,,,,,Food: 1000000000 stars
,,,,,I got:
,,,,,- foie gras on scallop sushi: 1000000/5
,,,,,- hamachi and quail egg sushi: 3/5
,,,,,"- 2 salmon nigiri, 2 tuna nigiri: 5/5"
,,,,,- rising sun roll: 4/5
,,,,,- lobster Mac & cheese: 4/5
,,,,,"Foie gras was INCREDIBLE. Never tasted anything like it. It's definitely rich though, the 2 pieces that gave was more than enough for me. Star of the show. My next favorite were the salmon and tuna nigiris. I always evaluate sushi restaurants through their salmon and tuna nigiris and they were incredible. Fresh, nice and generously cut. "
,,,,,"Next was the rising sun sushi. Wow, again so fresh and the hint of truffle oil was *chef's kiss*. The lobster Mac and cheese was incredible, but it came out last and I was so stuffed by then  My least favorite was the hamachi and quail egg sushi. Wasn't bad, but wouldn't order again. "
,,,,,Service: 4.5 stars
,,,,,The food came out pretty quickly and the servers were all polite! Only knocked off half a star because I had to ask for my water to be refilled. 
,,,,,Ambience: 4.5 stars
,,,,,"Nothing too flashy. I went during lunch time, so lots of business lunches happening around me. The tables were still generously spaced out due to COVID, which I greatly appreciated since I'm still a little anxious eating inside. I wouldn't say it's a formal place, but I wouldn't stroll in with casual wear. Sunday best/business casual seemed to be the going attire here."
,,,,,"Amazing place! Went here with my boyfriend for a date night. We made a reservation online and was running a few minutes and we called them and they said it was okay as long as it was no more than 15 mins. Our server, Calvin was great! He made fantastic recommendations and overall friendly and assertive. Will be back here for more get togethers with family and friends! I want to take everyone here. PS. The amberjack sashimi with Fois Gras was heaven on a plate"

,,,,,"Woah! Wow! Wa wa wee wa! Hands down the best sushi I've had in Houston!! My faves were the salmon, fatty tuna, eel, and scallop nigris. Such high quality fish! Loved loved the wagyu katsu sando and the lobster Mac and cheese!  Overall, everything was damn good! Service was outstanding! Prices were hella high haha"
,,,,,This place has become one of my fave restaurants in Houston. I really enjoy the entrees and nigiri.
,,,,,What I usually order and have eaten pretty much each time at kata:
,,,,,Wagyu sando
,,,,,Yellowtail and quail egg nigiri
,,,,,Foie gras and scallop nigiri
,,,,,Yuzu salmon
,,,,,Miso marinated black cod
,,,,,Amberjack foie gras
,,,,,Bone marrow 
,,,,,Lobster Mac and cheese is pretty good too but I gotta be in the mood for it.
,,,,,Service has always been efficient. Atmosphere has always been nice. They keepin up with the covid times. Make sure you make a reservation!
,,,,,"You really gotta know what to order when you come here. The first time I came here, I was not impressed! I probably would've rated this place 3/5 if I wrote a review then. I ordered some basic sashimi which I felt were overpriced for what they were. . . "
,,,,,But then! I came back for my birthday yesterday to give it a second chance. I went during happy hour and got items from the happy hour menu as well as regular menu.
,,,,,"Happy hour is totally worth: there's plenty of drinks and a couple of good food items. Babe got three old fashioned cocktails and thought they were pretty good. I got a mojito and beer. Shisito mojito was different from the usual but I enjoyed the kick! As for food, we shared Kobe beef tacos, spider roll, shumai, and salmon carpaccio. I'm not a big beef person but my jelly belly is and he only thought the Kobe beef tacos were okay. I did not care for it. Spider roll had soft shell crab in it, and it was pretty basic. The shumai and salmon carpaccio were BOMB. Shumai came out hot and full of flavor. Salmon carpaccio had such a refreshing taste! I would've ordered another one if I hadn't ordered too much food already."
,,,,,"As for the food on the regular menu, I got some special sashimi pieces (pics below), lobster Mac and cheese, and black cod. My fave of these items was the black cod. The texture and flavor were unforgettable. It was unexpectedly sweet, which was really good with a hint of lemon juice. I am drooling just thinking about it! Lobster Mac and cheese was good but it wasn't mesmerizing. This was my second time eating it, and both times I wasn't impressed."
,,,,,Got a free dessert for my bday and opted for the warm blueberry cake. It was so good! Ice cream that it came with paired very nicely. And the cake itself was the perfect warm temperature.
,,,,,"Service was great and vibes were perfect for date night or special occasion. Some people come here dressing casually and also formally. Complimentary valet also provided. Overall, the dining experience was excellent!"
,,,,,Love this place. Their sushi is good but I come here for their robota menu. Kobe beef tender juicy  and too die for. Lobster mac n cheese= never found a place that can compete. This is a must try. If you want to try something unique you can get the bone marrow too but I think portion is meh. Try to come around 4pm walk-in or get a reaervation for anything after cause this place be popping. For good reason too!
,,,,,The Best! All fabulous !A very friendly atmosphere to enjoy their delish sushi.
,,,,,From a major sushi lover- Go!!!
,,,,,"Before walking to Dessert Gallery for a nighttime sweet trip in this section, I went to dinner here for the first time ever tonight. I ordered their Rising Sun Roll, which was fantastic in all ways. No wonder it's a very popular sushi order here. It was very delicious with a very fresh, high quality and somewhat peppery taste to its overall flavor. I could really taste the fresh n high quality tuna and the touch of avocado in the roll. There were other flavors I couldn't put my finger on that made it unique and allowed the fish to stand out nicely with balance. Since I can't stand the really bitter n sour taste of wasabi, I asked for a double side of ginger which added that extra juiciness n slight tartness to the meal.  I was also impressed by the good amount they put for even just one serving of ginger. They don't skimp. The service was great and friendly on this visit as well. On a side note, I plan to try their Crab n Lobster Ramen order on another visit in the future."
,,,,,2 stars for reservation/front of house issues. Called multiple times on 09/15/21 starting from when they opened around 11:30am to later in the afternoon. Booked a reservation off of Resy since I was unable to reach by phone 24 hours before the reservation. Under special requests I indicated I tried calling to request omakase but unable to reach anyone and wanting to be seated at the sushi bar. 
,,,,,Arrived for the reservation only to be told omakase was not available. Was told I needed to have spoken to someone (when they don't answer the phone) and that I should have left a message. Also told its indicted online I have to speak to someone for omakase. I scoured the kata robata website and Resy and was unable to locate where I had to speak to someone or that I must leave a voicemail. The manager kept saying how busy they were as if my time calling and reaching out isn't valuable. 
,,,,,They did not look at the notes on Resy until I arrived. If I had known omakase was not available I would have dined elsewhere. I have dined here multiple times before but wanted omakase to celebrate a birthday. With such a late dinner reservation we were left with little options to go elsewhere. We were given a ton of excuses as to what WE should've done and what WE need to do in the future. It was such a sour taste in my mouth for the whole experience. No issue with our waitress or the food but definitely wouldn't come back. Beyond disappointed with the lack of professionalism. It was hard not to get upset when playing the blame game.
,,,,,"Kata is easily my second favorite sushi place in Houston after Uchi. Our server, Thai, was extremely personable and attentive. The foie nigiri and spicy soy ramen are my go to's every time I come. The pork belly with 60 degree egg, kobe beef skewer, and rising sun roll were stand outs. The wagyu nigiri, Texas hamachi roll, and a salmon nigiri special for the night were also good but could probably skip for next time. Always great service and fresh sushi when I come."
,,,,,"I've been waiting to try this place for years and it did not disappoint! My family is full of picky eaters, but everyone enjoyed the food. "
,,,,,"The kakuni pork belly was amazing and maybe one of my favorites!! Barely had to chew and the sauce was perfect. The texas kobe beef skewer was also amazing, my mom said it was the best piece of beef she's ever had. The miso lobster mac n cheese was sooooooo good. It was creamy, slightly sweet, and had a good amount of lobster pieces! The rising sun roll was one of my favorites of the night. We also ordered the texas hamachi roll and the longhorn roll. Both were great, but the truffle vinaigrette in the rising sun roll won me over. "
,,,,,We tried so many dishes and loved them all! The service was great and the atmosphere was very nice. Highly recommend trying it out
,,,,,"My friends and I decided to treat ourselves to sushi here a month in advance. We planned our night and were really looking forward to it! And I can say from the get go- it did not disappoint. The service was exquisite- we started our meal with warm towels to clean our hands. The waiter catered to our interests perfectly. We started with the Hamachi & Jalapeño Sashimi, and it was hands down the best thing I've ever had in my life. I dream about this food item. If I could give the restaurant 20 stars just for this item; I would!! Next we had the Rising Sun roll, and it was quite delicious. We also tried an assortment of nigiri pieces selected by our waiter, and he made some great suggestions! We finished off with a King Crab roll. This meal was an infusion of fresh flavors and definitely did not disappoint. I cannot wait to go back again!"
,,,,,I love Kata Robata!! I've only tried this place once but it is now one of my favorite sushi spots in Houston! My sister and I were starving so we ordered A LOT.
,,,,,Items we ordered:
,,,,,1) Uni pasta
,,,,,2) Uni nigiri 
,,,,,3) Toro uni caviar sushi
,,,,,4) Kinmedai (Japanese golden eye snapper)
,,,,,5) Foie gras and scallop
,,,,,6) Wagyu A5 nigiri
,,,,,7) Akamutsu (Japanese sea perch)
,,,,,5) Lobster and crab ramen
,,,,,6) New Zealand salmon
,,,,,7) Tamago Castella 
,,,,,8) Toro & Ikura Roll 
,,,,,9) Texas Hamachi Roll
,,,,,10) Rising Sun Roll
,,,,,"Overall, everything was delicious! The quality of their fish is amazing and fresh, definitely top notch. My favorite item was the toro uni caviar sushi. You get blue fin tuna with sea urchin and caviar on top. Ugh soooo good. I thought the uni pasta was just okay. It had more of a mushroom flavor that was overpowering, and I wish there were more pieces of uni in it. I probably wouldn't order the uni pasta again. Anyway, I can't wait for my next visit to Kata Robata!"
,,,,,"Always an incredible meal. The service, experience and food are always on point. 10/10 would recommend. Consistently some of the best sushi in town."

,,,,,"Best meal I've had in my entire life! We made a reservation here on a Saturday at 2:30 PM but couldn't arrive until later, and they were very accommodating in allowing us to come in past our reservation time."
,,,,,Things you should definitely order:
,,,,,- Lobster Miso Mac & Cheese: I would easily die for this. So decadent with 3 different types of cheeses. It's hearty & will definitely be a memorable dish.
,,,,,- Yuzu Marinated Salmon Sashimi: So fresh! If you love citrus and sashimi this is for you. 
,,,,,- Texas Wagyu Katsu Sando. Oh my god this was heaven on earth! Imagine beef just melting in your mouth. Bread was buttery and delicious. This is one of their biggest hits.
,,,,,- Chirashi: 11 different types of sashimi to sample! So fun & fresh.
,,,,,Things that are still good but probably wouldn't order again.
,,,,,- Grilled mushrooms
,,,,,- Blackened Cod 
,,,,,- Pork belly 
,,,,,Service was pretty attentive but nothing to write home to about. We enjoyed our meal & can't wait to come back to try more!
,,,,,BEST WAGYU SANDO IN TEXAS
,,,,,The sando is one the sole reason I come back to this place. They have good selection of meats comparably to other High end sushi places. 
,,,,,"Recommend ordering : WAGYU sando, WAGYU skewers, lobster sando"
,,,,,"Kata Robata's omakase is like flying first class. Once you do it, you don't ever want to do it any other way! So...sit at the bar and get the full chef experience. It was mouth watering and top notch in every way!"
,,,,,"I've lived in Houston my entire life, and I've only been to Kata Robata recently... big mistake on my end. "
,,,,,Wow. Words can't describe how fresh the sushi is here. I was amazed by the chefs selection of sashimi and the rolls. Every sashimi was so fresh and flavorful. No need for soy sauce! The rolls were immaculate as well. The atmosphere was cozy and quaint. Our waiter was attentive and amazing.
,,,,,"Went to Kata Robata last weekend because everyone keeps raving about how good it is. I had tried it before long time ago but hadn't been in a while since my last experience was ok. For this meal for 2, we got the following:"
,,,,,- kata's house salad with soy vinaigrette 
,,,,,- uni king crab spoon
,,,,,- miso eggplant w grilled sushi rice
,,,,,- lobster sando
,,,,,- rising sun roll
,,,,,"- nigiris: tuna, salmon, yellowtail"
,,,,,- warm blueberry cake
,,,,,"Honestly, the best thing here was the lobster sando. It's simply delicious! The salad was kind of bland, the uni king crab spoon would honestly be a lot tastier without a vinaigrette - it needs some other compliment, just not the daishi vinaigrette it comes with. Same for the rising sun roll. It could be better with a truffle oil concoction rather than a vinaigrette maybe. "
,,,,,"Everything else was good, but the cuts of fish are too big and I like the nigiris to have some sort of compliment as well. To each their own right? I will say their cuts of fish were very fresh and not fishy, but I don't prefer big cuts of fish, and I like there to be some sort of garnish with my nigiris. "
,,,,,"Finally the dessert was good, but I think Earl grey lavender ice cream would be a better combination for this dish instead of earl grey and lemon."
,,,,,Kata Robata has extensive delicious vegan options  
,,,,,"Pictured is the miso eggplant and crispy sushi rice, tofu and sautéed mushrooms, veggie sushi sampler and the kokonatsu lychee cocktail.  "
,,,,,"The service is great, parking is easy and food is spectacular"
,,,,,I was meeting a friend for the first time here and the experience was really good . Always wanted to try this place and I finally got a chance to their food is amazing and it's good . One of my favorite is the beef robota wow the meat is just so juicy and tender and the flavor is just right . 
,,,,,Their sushi is also really really fresh eascially and it is big size to the o toro fish is so good cut perfectly in the right spot of its tenderness 
,,,,,The atmosphere and service is amazing really friendly and nice I would come back here
,,,,,Everything was really fresh and delicious! The staff was very friendly and helpful. Ocean Picante was our favorite! Highly recommended.
,,,,,"If you want to go for lunch, come early. "
,,,,,The food and ambiance are great!
,,,,,We tried the sweated salad. It's was okay...
,,,,,But overall experience was fantastic.
,,,,,"Well worth the 45 minute wait on a thursday night. Y'all, their water? So fresh haha, the water was one of my favorite things but anyway. A friend and I came here around 8:30pm. We ordered the crab and lobster ramen. Impeccable. There are minimal words to describe the experience my taste buds went through, but everything was compatible with my palette. I would also like to add that the broth was extremely savory and the garnish on top complimented the lobster/crab so well. 10/10 would recommend for those especially if you're into ramen. Best $26 i've spent on a bowl of noodles by far. I will be back."

,,,,,"Definitely one of the most unique food experiences I've ever had with such a high quality level! The food was absolutely unbeatable and had such a level of originality. Each bite was a delectable burst of flavor and umami! The inside decor also provided a great complementary atmosphere to the food that I was enjoying. While on the slightly pricier side, I think the whole experience was worth it for sure."
,,,,,Wow. This place was great! 
,,,,,"Trendy but relaxed atmosphere, friendly staff, perfect for a date, business meeting or whatever. "
,,,,,"Do not miss out on this place. I was so hungry when we walked in, left with a food baby. I'm fairly certain the staff were like how did these 2 girls and kids eat so much food. "
,,,,,"The star of the meal was the Wagyu katsu sando. The bread was fluffy Japanese milk bread. It was amazing. The wagyu was rich in flavor, so soft, and I'll be dreaming of this sandwich long after I'm back from Tx. Do not miss out on this sandwich. It's perfection. "
,,,,,"Iberico Shumai-it was savory, a little salty for my taste, but still not something to be missed. "
,,,,,Heritage pork miso gyoza-this was eaten by the kiddos but I was told it was good. 
,,,,,"Rising sun roll-it tasted fresh, bright flavors with a truffle vinaigrette, if I lived closer this would be my go-to for sushi. Yum. "
,,,,,"Longhorn roll-fried shrimp, eel, avocado, if a hug was sushi, this feels like the equivalent. It had rave reviews from the two year old who ate multiple pieces. "
,,,,,I didn't get pics of a few of the things: 
,,,,,"the mixed tempura, basic but delicious as expected"
,,,,,"spicy soy ramen, the egg was perfectly cooked but didn't seem like the soup was actually spicy, still pretty good. "
,,,,,"Miso Lobster Mac & cheese- so rich and creamy, good for sharing due to the size of it. *side note: this still tastes good the next day if you reheat it."
,,,,,The service here was fast and wonderful. Andy is the bar tender there and he made us delicious drinks to go well with our dinner!! Fish is fresh here and we loved everything. The only negative thing I have to say is that it took at least $400 to get us full lol.
,,,,,"Andy and Vicki served us at this delicious restaurant... they were very helpful and kind!! Definitely ask for them when you're there. The fish here are all high quality which I love  I loved all the dishes you see here in my pictures.... especially the otoro sashimi, oyster, Kobe beef skewer (we ate too fast to get a pic), and wagyu shumai!! The only item I was not a fan of was the foie gras- too rich for me at that moment. Overall, I would go there again when I'm in town."
,,,,,"I think I've found the best sushi  restaurant in Houston! Kata Robata is an amazing Japanese restaurant located in the Upper Kirby area. The decor appears to be very traditional Japanese and modern. But word to the wise, the place gets packed and it's best to get a reservation! "
,,,,,"We first started with the Nigiri (yellowtail, Toro, Salmon, Shrimp, and scallops). And let me preface this review by saying that I'm traditionally a cooked sushi girl but this Nigiri was amazing. The fish was so fresh and literally melted in your mouth. The rice was cooked to perfection and not a hint of sogginess in the rice! 5/5"
,,,,,"Next we had the Longhorn signature sushi roll that included: shrimp tempura, avacado, eel, and spicy Mayo! Yes! Yes! Yes! Just order this because you won't be disappointed. 5/5 "
,,,,,We also tried the lobster ramen. Flavors were there and there was large pieces of lobster but sadly our noodles were over cooked. 4/5
,,,,,"Waygu Sando is the most elevated sandwich I've ever had. The waygu melted in your mouth and the sauce paired so well with the meat, and the texture of the bread all combined together was an explosion of flavors . An easy 5/5! "
,,,,,The shrimp and pork dumpling were also really good but fair warning it does have a strong vinegar flavor. 4/5. 
,,,,,For desert we had the warm blueberry cake and tea ice cream. Such a unique desert and was extremely good! 5/5.
,,,,,We were here for lunch and they do have quite a varieties on their menu.
,,,,,Service was impressive and food was amazing.
,,,,,The restaurant is bigger than I thought and they do have a spacious patio in the back of the restaurant.
,,,,,Our server To did a very good job on accommodating us.
,,,,,Definitely coming back in the future.
,,,,,Came here on a weekday lunch. Got some apps
,,,,,"House salad, seaweed salad, pork belly and papaya salad and some starters (Hamachi plate, amberjack plate with foie, chowamushi [don't recommend this one], and roasted bone marrow. We got some sashimi in fatty tuna and snapper. Both were excellent."
,,,,,The rolls are hit and miss. Rising sun roll is great and some of the other rolls are meh. Overall still great quality and selection.
,,,,,"We went back, this time for a 2 person dinner date. We got papaya salad and some sashimi for apps, and rolls for entrees and some drinks. The food is still decent but service definitely was not as good as when we had a larger party. Obviously Kata is still on the pricier end compared to other sushi joints but you get what you pay for to a degree. The service this time was a bit slow, our request to be moved because it was super cold due to the AC was totally ignored by our server. "
,,,,,Food 4/5
,,,,,Service 3/5
,,,,,Ambiance 4/5
,,,,,Pretty fantastic sushi and Japanese restaurant located in Kirby. Good 2nd or 3rd date spot or lunch meeting spot. 
,,,,,"Appetizers include the papaya salad, octopus crudo, wagyu sandos. The menu is pricey but the food is high quality and actually good.. The sushi selection is all good, whether served as sashimi or in a roll. "
,,,,,"The desserts are actually great for an Asian restaurant (not really known for their desserts in general). Food 5/5. Service 5/5. Bang for the buck 4/5. If you're looking for an Uchi that you can afford and take friends to, this is the spot.  My favorite sushi joint inside the loop."
,,,,,Top 2 fancy sushi spots IMO. 
,,,,,I am disappointed in myself that I'm just now giving a review lol. Been here wayyyy too many times not to. Kata has some of the best quality fishes and flavor profiles at a sushi spot. 
,,,,,My go to ALWAYS is the Fois Gras Scallops Nigiri and the Rising Sun Roll (truffle x yellow tail x peppercorn tuna). 
,,,,,The green tea soufflé cheesecake was so delicious too! 
,,,,,Made reservations ahead of time because they're always super busy! Which is awesome. 
,,,,,Parking-within a parking lot. Same plaza as dessert gallery.
,,,,,Lunch was beyond just a great experience! We made an online reservation which made the lunch rush an ease for us. 
,,,,,"We started with 3 assorted sushi (picture attached). My favorite was the chopped scallop but honestly all were an amazing, flavorful experience in my mouth. "
,,,,,"I also got the Kobe Beef bento box lunch, which basically each slice melted in my mouth (sooo good)! I can't wait to come back to try more!"
,,,,,"Parking wasn't too bad at lunch time on a Wednesday since there is a private lot shared with the surrounding shops, but I can definitely see how it would be a hassle when busier."
,,,,,"Kata Robata is truly a Houston gem. Whenever a friend visits and is craving sushi, this is our go to spot. Whenever we want a consistently great dinner for special occasions, this is our go to. Even after coming to Kata for the last 7 years or so, they have stayed consistently fantastic. "
,,,,,"Great ambiance, service, and food - from appetizers, to fresh sushi, omakase experience, cocktails, we enjoy it all. It's been a great restaurant to take my work colleagues especially out of towners as well. "
,,,,,"Highlights for me are the kobe beef skewers (must have!), grilled octopus, and miso black cod for cooked items. On the sushi/sashimi front, everything is fresh and the omakase is one of the best in town (as of early 2020, there are many new competitors I've yet to try)."
,,,,,"Overall, would recommend as a great business lunch/dinner, date spot, or celebration meal."
,,,,,"The food is great, and the atmosphere is excellent. We end up with a unhappy waitress. We would've enjoy the meal more if they assign us with a better server. No introduction or greeting, and takes forever for her to come back to our table each time. Finally, I hope the waitress with attitude have a lovely day!"

,,,,,"For this year's birthday, my friends took me to Kata Robata for dinner. We had reservations ahead of time, so there was no wait for us on a Saturday evening. I've always heard great things about this place but didn't have a chance to try it out."
,,,,,The inside of the restaurant was pretty clean and simple. We were seated at the booth and greeted promptly to order:
,,,,,"Lobster Mac and Cheese: so delicious. I'm a sucker for Mac n cheese, and there was a decent amount of lobster chunks in it."
,,,,,"Texas Wagyu Katsu Sando: Also sooo good. The wagyu melts in your mouth. Portion is quite small, but this is filling because it is so rich."
,,,,,Sushi Platter: this is a chef's choice of a mix of nigiri and salmon or tuna rolls. The fish was very fresh and I enjoyed all of it.
,,,,,Texas Hamachi Rolls: Also really good. Tasted light and fresh.
,,,,,Tropical Spicy Tuna: probably my favorite roll. Salmon and avocado go so well together!
,,,,,Grilled Octopus with Yuzukoshō Vinaigrette: great starter item. The octopus was very tender and flavorful.
,,,,,"Toro + Uni + Caviar Sushi: Hooolyy heck, this was the star of the night. An explosion of so much melty goodness. I only ordered one of these, because it's $23 for just one piece. But hey, it's my birthday!!"
,,,,,"Green Tea Soufflé Cheesecake: this was comped for my birthday, which was a wonderful surprise. This dessert was so amazing, and definitely way better than I expected it to be. It was so light and fluffy, and not overly sweet."
,,,,,"Overall, as you can tell, I really loved all of the food. The service was good, however I did have to ask multiple times for our drink orders that seemed to have been forgotten, as well as the ramen that was ordered. In the end, we ended up cancelling the ramen because we finished dinner and dessert, so I'm quite certain the item was missed. Regardless, I will definitely be back here for the food."
,,,,,"September 23, 2021"
,,,,,Drove in from Galveston for the day and chose this place for a late lunch. 
,,,,,"It was packed at 1:30pm but, we only waited 10 minutes. "
,,,,,"The menu is extensive with everything you could possibly want in sushi, bento boxes, ramen, sashimi, etc"
,,,,,3600 Kirby Dr
,,,,,"An extensive wine selection, great selection of saki and specialty cocktails. "
,,,,,"The staff is friendly, efficient and detail oriented. "
,,,,,We each had a glass of really good white wine to go with our sushi. 
,,,,,"I got the Caribbean roll ($17) which had fried lobster, spicy tuna and mango...delish. "
,,,,,"Friend got theTexas Hamachi ($18) eel, yellowtail, fried shrimp and jalapeños-delish.  "
,,,,,"What's crazy...we both compare any and all sushi places to RA...(several locations on Houston) and, even though this was delicious..."
,,,,,RA is STILL our number one! 
,,,,,Oh! 
,,,,,And FYI...
,,,,,the toilets have the option to be a bidet for that oh so fresh feeling!!!
,,,,,Came for friend's birthday and it was a great experience! 
,,,,,The ramen is some of the best I've had. The broth is so flavorful. It has the right amount of fat and pork flavor but still was light. We loved the freshness and brightness of the sushi. All of it was top notch. Some of the best Houston has to offer. They are too rated for a reason. Service was great. Sushi came out fairly fast even though there was a full house. Can be pricey but the fish is extremely fresh and not always the typical pieces you get at other sushi restaurants in town.
,,,,,"I'm in love with Wagyu sando!! It's a must try when you go here! ($20), but worth lol. "
,,,,,The service is super as well. Our waiter is very helpful and recommended great dishes to us! Worth every penny.
,,,,,"The most delicious delicious food with amazing people. Sat at the bar most of the night before later joining a table. The whole experience was nothing but enjoyable. The bathroom alone is an experience worth writing about, nothing about Kata Robata or it's service will leave you in dismay."
,,,,,"I ate and highly recommend the Caribbean Roll, Scallop and Foie Gras Sushi, Green Tea Souffle with Red Bean Ice Cream, Warm Blueberry Cake with Lemon Ice Cream, Grilled Oyster Mushrooms, Vegan Soba Salad, Barracuda, Pork Belly and Papaya Salad, Octopus Crudo, Kaluga Caviar and Uni Oysters, and a Chef's Sashimi for Two (asked for the shrimp heads to be fried and got them back freshly hot with lemon to squeeze). "
,,,,,"I drank and recommend the Shishito Mojito, Serenity, and Fake ID."
,,,,,Kata Robata is one of my favorite restaurants on earth. Consistent quality and service. See you soon Kata Robata!
,,,,,"Used to come here often but moved away. Had lunch with a friend and food was good but slow service. The hostess wasn't friendly. It was a late lunch 1 pm, so no issue in parking. "
,,,,,Will stop by if in the neighborhood again. I believe the Azuma group owns this place along with Soma sushi.
,,,,,"we were sad to see the bone marrow taken off the menu, but we stuck to our personal favorite Chef's Sashimi for Two, which never disappoints! Every assorted fish was fresh and melted in our mouth. It's served on a huge bowl of ice, which was very presentable. I also ordered the Fake ID, which is a mocktail of fever tree ginger beer, lychee, and lemon. It tasted like lychee lemonade and I loved it so much! We then ordered the Iberico Pork Shumai, which came with a splash of chili oil and ponzu sauce. This one was really cute, but it was okay in our opinion. Next was our foie gras & scallop sushi. And oh my god, it literally melts in your mouth. Highly recommend. We tried out the toro + uni + caviar sushi, which was $$ but everything tasted fresh and this was our first time trying a caviar that WASN'T super salty like other places. Then, we got the Texas Wagyu Katsu Sando, which was so crispy and flavorful -- also recommend. We ended the meal with Lobster & Crab Ramen, which was like a lobster bisque level thickness of a broth, and came with lots of lobster and lots of crab. This was the perfect balance to all the cold items we ordered earlier, and the noodles were perfectly al dente. I would literally come back forever for this ramen. It's amazing please try it there's nothing like it around town!!"

,,,,,"Called to book an omakase for my birthday and happily found out that they just started omakase again. Turns out we ended up being their first omakase upon restart, and let me tell you, I was not disappointed!"
,,,,,"Every plate was fantastic - the subtle layering of flavors, the freshness of the fish, the presentation, and of course the taste!!  Every bite was perfection. "
,,,,,"I liked how every course was also accompanied by guidance on how to eat (with chopstick, by hand, from left to right, dip here first, how to apply wasabi, etc) to make the most of the bite. "
,,,,,The timing didn't feel rushed at all yet our empty plates were always whisked away promptly. Great service by Anh and team!  
,,,,,"This is one of the few times we've gone out since COVID and the first time to such a crowded place, and I appreciated that they accommodated our request to be seated at a table close to the sushi bar but not right in the midst of 10 other tables. We were at our own little booth next to the sushi bar and it was great!  "
,,,,,Favorites from the omakase are hard to choose but I'll list my top 3:
,,,,,- uni toast two ways with truffles
,,,,,This was definitely a great romantic sushi place with high quality freshness. It was extremely packed on a Saturday night but my bf made reservations prior to arriving. I would suggest doing rsvp first so you can be guaranteed a quick table ready! Our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful with describing each dish that we had questions on. Each dish tasted amazing and unique! The fish were fresh and had no fishiness smell to it at all. Definitely worth the visit. 
,,,,,The sashimi for two is highly recommended by yours truly. It's huge and will meet your aesthetic expectations. Not to mention each fish was exquisite and fresh. I really loved the fatty tuna. 
,,,,,"The king crab with uni spoon was so fun and light, and left me wanting more spoons haha."
,,,,,The Caribbean roll was really yummy and they really stuffed the lobster in there. It's great if raw fish isn't your thing. 
,,,,,"The bone marrow with toast was..SO YUMMY. The only thing I have to say is the toast seemed to be so airy with various big holes that it made it hard to place my bone marrow on. Other than that, loved it and PRO TIP: don't skip out on the toppings and esp the lime juice. It really gives it another dimension. "
,,,,,"The scallops and foie gras tasted just as good as they looked. The scallops were enormous in size and sliced in half, so you get a total of 2 scallops on that plate with the foie gras but definitely worth. "
,,,,,"Overall, I would come back for any special occasion or date involving a sushi craving."
,,,,,Everything we tried at this restaurant was absolutely amazing! The flavors are so unique and the fish is very fresh. The food is rich and delicious. The ambiance is also a nice added touch with how beautiful it is inside and also this restaurant provides good service. Definitely will be going back for their unique flavors and fresh fish!
,,,,,"My friend wanted to bring me here, so we traveled to Kata Robata for my first time! I highly recommend making reservations for dining."
,,,,,"Parking can be a hot mess, especially during the peak lunch and dinner times. It didn't help there was some construction going on at the corner parking lot, eliminating 3 parking spaces. Aside from this, there are a few designated spots for curbside pickup directly in front of the restaurant."
,,,,,"I did not get to experience the indoor dining, so I can't comment on that. My friend managed to grab a table in the back patio."
,,,,,FOOD:
,,,,,"1. Bone Marrow (4/5; pickled mustard seeds, pickled onions, panko, red miso, bonito flakes): Three huge bone marrow pieces with plenty to share. The bone marrow, itself, is a bit plain and buttery. I recommend you combine the mustard seeds, pickled onions, and lime juice to fully enjoy the flavors and textures."
,,,,,"2. Texas Kobe Beef Skewers (5/5; 72-hour sous vide, teriyaki sauce, sesame seeds): Heavenly. This melts in your mouth with great flavors of the teriyaki glaze and sesame. 3 bites in 1 skewer. Definitely can share between 2 people, as there are 2 skewers in this dish."
,,,,,"3. Miso Marinated Black Cod (3/5; grilled miso-marinated Alaskan black cod): You typically cannot go wrong with the Miso black cod, but this one was slightly disappointing. The fish did not seem as fresh as other similar dishes I've tried, and it did not have that melt-in-my-mouth sensation. In addition, it seemed like there was teriyaki sauce at the centerpiece of plate, under the black cod."
,,,,,4. Unagi (4/5; freshwater eel): Simple. Can't go wrong with this!
,,,,,"5. Foie Gras & Scallops (5/5): My favorite! However, the foie gras slightly overpowered the scallops. 2 pieces in 1 order!"
,,,,,"6. Texas Hamachi Roll (3/5; yellowtail, spicy tuna, freshwater eel, fried shrimp, yuzu juice, jalapeños, sea salt): It's a lighter roll with a more citrus taste. I liked the crunch from the jalapenos. It was just decent overall though."
,,,,,"7. Seared Blue Fin Toro with Wasabi Vinaigrette (5/5): This is part of the daily special menu. It was definitely a favorite! The wasabi vinaigrette is not overpowering, and toro tuna is delicious!"
,,,,,"Service was okay during lunch time, and I despised the flies swarming around our food. Our waters never touched bottom though! They were on that! This place tends to get loud. "
,,,,,- a5 wagyu with... truffles
,,,,,- nigiri plate
,,,,,"There is not one dish that I would say ""meh, coulda done without it.""  They were all that good. "
,,,,,"10 dishes for ~$170/person. We were full and happy by the end so it was well worth it. The only minor complaint is that it was my birthday and I had mentioned it when making the reservation, but there was no mention of it when we were there. But no worries - still had a GREAT birthday dinner! "
,,,,,"I've been to a couple omakase around town, and this one may be my favorite so far. I appreciate a good, traditional omakase that's more fish forward. Two thumbs up to the chef!!"
,,,,,"If you took nothing else from this review, know that omakase is back at Kata :)."
,,,,,"It's been 5-6 years since we've gone here, sooo depressing. Obviously, It was the right call to book our first honeymoon dinner here as our return!"
,,,,,"Again, everything was delicious from the Hamachi Quail Egg down to the impressively decorated nigiri plate, filled with flavor and freshness! All of the uni was a DELIGHT!!"
,,,,,Checkout the IG reel at @phidingthefam
,,,,,"The place to go to get great customer service AND great Japanese cuisine, from starters down until desserts. I was in Houston for a couple of days and this is by far the best place I was able to go to."
,,,,,"We started with the Ocean Picante roll, perfect starter being light, flavorful with a hint of spice from the jalepenos. Next came out the Mixed Ceviche & the Big Eye Tuna Poke, which I would say was our favorites of the meal. Even our next portion was good & extraordinary, the shrimp tempura. These next two meals were our endings: the the Miso Encrusted Bone Marrow (very good) and Kobe Beef skewers (100% must have). I'm actually curious on what isn't good here...  "
,,,,,"The staff was very friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient. Ours was Xuong (Shon), highly recommended."
,,,,,"Kata Robata is pretty good! It's a slightly less traditional Japanese restaurant and their options are more on the experimental side, but we enjoyed everything we ordered. The wagyu sando was delicious, and I would recommend that above everything else. The uni is also pretty good, but I would pass on the uni oysters. Bone marrow was delicious at first, but it gets very heavy and overwhelming quickly. "
,,,,,"This isn't a bad option for sushi, and the menu is so extensive that you're bound to be happy with almost everything you order."
,,,,,"Kata Robata. Let's talk about it. Stellar service and even better food. The first time I ever went was during happy hour and they had some pretty great drinks and bites. You can't go wrong with the kokonatsu lychee, the rolls are heavenly, and by the grace of the hostess that you get a table here, the miso lobster macaroni and cheese is a must. The menu rotates every now and then with seasonal offerings but the staples are hit after hit. The yuzu marinated salmon sashimi is quite literally *chef's kiss.* I've yet to be disappointed by anything I've tried here and this is my second time around. The scallop sushi was also impeccable. Reservations are probably recommended if you're trying to get a seat here most nights or else it's quite a wait. I went on a regular weekday and it was packed to the brim but was able to get full service over at the bar. Less of a family-oriented style establishment and more like business casual/savvy or fancy date night type of a vibe. And if you're dining here, the bill is $$$ but you know exactly what you're getting yourself into every time. I've dropped a pretty penny here both visits and would gladly do it again. The quality of the food and the service does all the talking. You just have to eat to find out. I still dream about that elevated adult mac and cheese. I would fight a kid for it probably."
,,,,,"The food here was absolutely PHENOMENAL. We went for my husband's birthday - it's been a life long dream of his to eat here and it most definitely did not disappoint! I, as a non-sushi lover, enjoyed my experience just as much as my husband did with his sushi....and that's certainly saying something. "
,,,,,"My husband got the Chef's Premium ""Omakase"" - his face said it all, he was in absolute heaven. "
,,,,,For the non-sushi items we tried:
,,,,,"Would I come back? Yes, I would! Quality food."
,,,,,"Great experience there for a lunch. This place was so popular and crowded so fortunately we made a reservation. Our top one dish was the lunch Kobe beef bowl, which was kinda like the Korean bibimbap. It was so flavorful and everything in it was just yummy and filling. Second fav was the aged beef skewers - they were very tender and juicy. Sashimi selection plate was just ok - I liked the Chu Toro and king salmon a la cart order better. But overall, nothing was bad, food it was in good portion and everything came in with reasonable prices. We were literally ordering a lot of dishes without hitting our bills too bad. Will come back!"
,,,,,"Texas Kobe Beef Skewers - This is hands down my favorite item, the meat is super flavorful, tender, and just melts in your mouth! I've never had anything like it and I look forward to coming back and ordering this again. My mouth is actually salivating while thinking about this now......yummmm"
,,,,,"Iberico Pork Shumai - This was good, but nothing extremely spectacular. I probably would not order this again just because I'd rather spend my money on other items. It was worth trying though."
,,,,,"Texas Wagyu Katsu Sando - The sandwich was good; however, there was way too much mayo which completely overpowered the dish. I would get this again, but make sure to ask that they go light on the mayo."
,,,,,"Wagyu Tsukune - This item which was on the daily specials, is essentially a beef/pork meatball and I'm totally here for it! Highly recommend this option!"
,,,,,"It is quite pricey here, but the food quality is well worth it. It's a great spot for a date night or a special occasion. You will most definitely not be disappointed! My only very minor criticism is that it was quite chilly inside the restaurant - so make sure to bring a sweater and your appetite because it'll be a meal you'll never forget!"
,,,,,"My parents used to take me here a lot when I was younger, but then we eventually stopped coming for some reason. We were around the area and decided to stop by for some of my favorite food, raw fish! When we walked in, we were surprised to see that there was no wait and we decided to sit at the sushi bar. When sitting up there, the chefs are very nice to you, and it is fascinating to see them cut the fish right in front of you. You can also see how fresh the fish is, extraordinary!"
,,,,,Food We Ordered:
,,,,,"Premium Sashimi for 2 - The sashimi was prepared right in front of us, it was so cool to see how perfectly and swiftly they cut it! All of the fish were delicious and you could taste how fresh they were. Super high quality for a decent price!"
,,,,,"Wagyu Katsu Sando - When I spotted this on the menu, I immediately wanted this. Thank goodness I ordered it, it was pure deliciousness! The meat melted in your mouth and the bread was so soft, yet crispy on the outside because of the toasting. It was the best sando I have ever had in my life. "
,,,,,"Warm Blueberry Cake - Usually, I am not a fan of cake, but the description of this dish convinced me to order it. The warm cake paired with the cold ice cream was the perfect pair and I couldn't get enough of it. I would order this dessert again in a heartbeat and it was so good!"
,,,,,"One of my favorite places to meet friends for a quick lunch, impressed with both the food and service every single time! "
,,,,,"I usually order Kata Special Chirashi $24, good portion, so fresh and refreshing, and beautiful to look at ..."
,,,,,Gorgeous atmosphere. The freshest seafood with an incredible eye for detail. 
,,,,,Smart flavor combinations that truly pleased. Can't wait to return.
,,,,,"We had the best experience at Kata Robata to date. Service was friendly, attentive but not intrusive, with great recommendations from our server for food and sake. Everything we tried today was delicious and fresh."
,,,,,"Haven't been here for several years.  Sat at the sushi bar and it was a casual place.  We tried the various fish specials for sushi, tempura lobster, soft shell crab, bone marrow... and a bottle of sake.  All solid choices."
,,,,,We always enjoy dining here and highly recommend it! Located in small square with ample parking. This was our second time around. Ordered the grilled octopus and miso marinated black cod which were both excellent! The cod melts in your mouth. Another dish which is a must try is the Kobe beef skewers. The meat is marinated 72 hrs and just perfect! Never disappoints. Tried the ocean picante signature roll and loved it! It's wrapped around an asparagus and is a roll on the spicier side which was absolutely delicious and hit the spot! 
,,,,,"One down side however is they do not have a changing table in any of the rest rooms hence unfortunately is not kid friendly. Kata Robata, please install a baby changing table! Your customers will love you more!"

,,,,,Good eggs ! Best bacon ! Jazzy toast! Fresh squeezed orange juice Yum yum yummmm . This place is super small so the weekend line is more then then the week days wait. I love that they have a unisex restroom. 
,,,,,Definitely coming back.
,,,,,Parking in front is limited but there is plenty of street parking.
,,,,,"What a cute, local, and wonderful place for brunch. Bring your dog! "
,,,,,"Atmosphere: BE WARNED! You may have to wait. It's a bit small, with some inside and outside seating and there's usually a wait. Be sure to write your name on the clipboard hanging in front of the door!! That's how they know you're waiting in line. "
,,,,,"Service: 5/5 Our waiter was the bomb dot com. Sweet, funny, and so friendly! He explained all our questions about the menu so well, brought out a doggy water bowl and biscuits for my friend's dog, and even brought out a plate of biscuits that they make homemade for us to try! "
,,,,,"Price: 4/5 Typical breakfast prices. $10ish dollars for a meal, but the plates are full and well worth the price. "
,,,,,"Food: 4/5 They're known for their green eggs and ham, so I HAD to try it since it was my first time! Their eggs are perfectly scrambled with cheese, spinach, and artichoke (think of spinach and artichoke dip in a scrambled egg form) with a massive amount of potatoes that were roasted, seasoned perfectly, and crispy on the outside. It also came with toast and chicken apple sausage which was nicely grilled and charred ! I can definitely see why it's recommended."
,,,,,"The waffle was so thick and fluffy, must try! I ordered the breakfast plate and the best part was the home fries, delicious!!"
,,,,,"Good spot for easy, simple breakfast with friends, brunch, etc. A bit expensive for what it is but consistent quality."
,,,,,My favorite brunch spot in Houston! I don't say this often...but probably one of the few places I don't mind waiting up to 45mins to be seated. The food is that great!
,,,,,"My go to order - Green Eggs ($10.95). Comes with 2 eggs scrambled with spinach and artichoke hearts with jack cheese. You also get chicken apple sausage, potatoes, and toast (but I ask for biscuit instead). You can't go wrong with ordering this. The eggs are so creamy and you can't even tell you're eating veggies with it. "
,,,,,Chicken fried steak & eggs ($10.95). The chicken fried steak is seasoned very well and you get a decent portion. You also get a side of potatoes. Very filling meal!
,,,,,Seasonal fruit pancake ($8.95). You might be wondering why the heck a pancake is almost $9...ITS BIGGER THAN THE SIZE OF YOUR FACE! I always get blueberry and it's so delicious and fluffy. The warm bursts of blueberry are amazing. 
,,,,,The potatoes had to have its own paragraph. They're perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. My mouth is watering just thinking about them. Make sure you have a side of potatoes with whatever you're eating. You won't regret it. 
,,,,,"All in all, this is my top Houston brunch spot because 1) food is great 2) service is awesome 3) prices are affordable."
,,,,,"This spot was so great. Scott was the best server i could ask for, super friendly and made us feel so comfortable. The food was amazing, literally everything was great. 10/10 experience for me and my friends."
,,,,,"Spent 20 minutes searching through Yelp for a great breakfast spot on our last morning in Houston and we found it. There was a list they had you add your name, how many in your party and whether you had a seat preference. Only thing I'd add is a sign or something in front showing where the list is. We waited a little less than than hour for our name to be called for an inside table. Waitress was friendly and took our order quickly and food came out quickly. Got 2 breakfast plates and split a French toast. All of it was great. Had to let the French toast soak in some syrup but I was still good. Orange juice was super freshly squeezed and hot chocolate tasted great. Would definitely come back if we made another trip to Houston."
,,,,,"So affordable, so yummy. My fiancé and I were in Houston Montrose area for a weekend trip, and ate Saturday breakfast here at 12 noon, they close weekends at 2 pm. I got the chicken fried steak with 2 sunny side up eggs and hash browns and orange juice. Most menus items 10 bucks or less. Delicious. Pleasantly filled me up for the entire day. LGBT cool area. Excellent waitstaff service."
,,,,,"I think I found one of my new favorite breakfast places! The portions are large, the staff is oh so friendly, and it's dog friendly! "
,,,,,"Let me start with the parking situation, I will say...it could be better but I understand. The parking lot is small, and if you can't make it happen, street parking is your other option. Get here early, it seems to stay busy (for good reason). The wait was reasonable the day we visited (maybe 20 minutes?), we signed in and then kept an ear out for our name. Service was very friendly and for the most part pretty attentive. "
,,,,,"I loved my meal, I ordered the Breakfast Burrito. It was larger than expected, filled with black beans, egg and cheese, and comes with more potatoes than you can finish with a mild salsa on the side - a perfect combo if you ask me. My meal was simple but delicious, and I can't wait to be back and try more of their food!"

They are always packed. I love the outdoor seating. I have been here twice and I have always sat outside. "
,,,,,This is a must stop when you come to Houston! 
,,,,,There are several locations across Houston. This is a great location! I will be back with my family!

,,,,,"This breakfast place is quaint and yummy. They offer good choices for standard breakfast fare. I got the breakfast plate (2 eggs, with choice of fried potatos or grits, bacon or sausage, and biscuit or bread). I ordered this with scrambled eggs, the fried potatos, bacon, and biscuits. The potatos were nicely crispy and the biscuit were flaky. I recommend adding jam to this. Overall a good breakfast. I also recommend trying the fresh-pressed orange juice. It's refreshing and delicious. "
,,,,,The service is nice and hospitable. The prices are also reasonable. Their creative interior design makes for a cute brunch place. They list their specials and other offerings on the wall so be sure to take a look at that. I went with a friend and it gave us a good start to our day. 
,,,,,Note: this location closes at 12PM
,,,,,We are so disappointed about the takeout food today. We have had the breakfast there for over three years. That's the first time we questioned the food quality. My apple sausage and toast was super over burned. Everything in my plate looks dark. The Migas ordered is not half as good as it used to be.
,,,,,"Dishes/Drinks: Apple-Pecan Pancake, Banana-Walnut Pancake, side Chicken-Apple Sausage, side Veggie Sausage, Migas, Coffee and fresh-squeezed OJ. Also mentioned: Green Eggs"
,,,,,Both the Apple-Pecan Pancake and the Banana-Walnut Pancake were quite disappointing for my brunch-mates. The pancakes were dry and crumbly... and not flavorful enough to make up for it! 
,,,,,The side Chicken-Apple Sausage has a wonderful flavor balance of sweet and savory and was cooked perfectly. 
,,,,,"It's super nice to have a Veggie Sausage option! I'm not sure what brand it is, but it was very similar to Trader Joe's breakfast veggie sausage (80% sure that's the brand they use lol), either way it was yummy. (Woot woot vegetarian options!!!)"
,,,,,"The migas were yummy (delicious tomatoes, onions, peppers in the eggs, which were cooked perfectly!), but it's odd they don't serve it with tortillas. I guess that's because they know where their specialties lie: they don't make tortillas. The potatoes were DELICIOUS AF though! (basically, they're fried chunks of glory)"
,,,,,"Their coffee is really good, but their fresh-squeezed orange juice is TO. DIE. FOR. (unless you only drink pulp-free - there's a small amount of pulp). "
,,,,,"I've also had the Green Eggs on a different visit and honestly I find it hard to order anything else, I love them so much! Be warned, the eggs are quite moist (I like it though!). The flavor is GREAT and the toast that comes with it is delicious."
,,,,,"Fabulous little spot! I stopped by on a Sunday morning and when I saw the pastel rainbow ceiling and heard the Dolly Parton playing I knew I found the right place for brunch. Baby Barnaby's reminds of the little eateries in New Orleans, small but quaint and absolutely delicious! I opted for a waffle with a side of potatoes (yay carbs), the potatoes were seasoned to perfection. The staff was very nice and service was excellent. Come early or expect a wait, there's a small parking lot but it's mainly street parking."
,,,,,If I can give this place 10 stars I would! It has been out breakfast spots since we moved to Houston! Always good always fresh! Green eggs are delicious
,,,,,Service was okay but im not a fan of the checking in process. I ordered the green eggs and the artichoke was overwhelmingly runny for me personally. I recommend the steak and eggs if anything. Price was reasonable.
,,,,,"So I did it, I went ahead and tried the infamous ( Green Eggs)"
,,,,,They were worth the hype! Full of flavor! For a Saturday Brunch the wait wasn't too bad.  Only
,,,,,Down side apart from the food coming out fast was that it was kind of cold. But over all the vibe is cool and casual..
,,,,,Located in the vibrant Montrose area so that is a plus. Locating parking is a bit challenging but once you find somewhere to park it's uphill from there. 
,,,,,I ordered the chicken fried steak and LAWD it was delicious. My potatoes were cooked to perfection and the fruit cup was fresh. 
,,,,,It a little loud but a great place to eat. It has a patio as well.
,,,,,"We had brunch at Baby Bar any' sand were pleasantly surprised with the quality, portions and savoriness of the food.  The orange juice was freshly squeezed and exceptionally tasty.  The meal was complemented by our server, Scott.  He was attentive and pleasantly humorous, adding immensely to atmosphere.  Commended highly!"
,,,,,"Food is obviously great but get ready for an attitude if Scott answers the phone. I did not see pancakes on the menu when I called and instead of just giving me the options he told me to look at the menu online and then call him back with an attitude. I was wrong the pancakes were on the menu but I guess it was too much to ask for him to tell me the THREE options they had. I always report great service and rarely report bad attitudes but I'm sick of people thinking they can just talk to people however and not have any repercussions. I know this review won't do much because the rest of the place and other servers are awesome, but something had to be said for the unprofessionalism by one individual. I know the service in person and food  is great just don't call the food order in when Scott answers."

,,,,,"Baby Barnaby's is such a quaint little brunch place. It's pretty small, so prepare to be intimate with all your table neighbors! And on days that it doesn't rain, outside seating is most likely favored as it's a tad more spacious. "
,,,,,"I ordered the green eggs (spinach, artichoke, & jack cheese) plate. Honestly, I was afraid at first, but HONEY, it was great! I am NOT a spinach person, but I ate every bit of eggs on my plate. It is was THAT good. As for the rest of the meal, the chicken apple sausage & potatoes weren't bad. For both, I'd say taste was slightly over average."
,,,,,"The service is okay. There was a small mishap with our order, but everyone was pretty nice. "
,,,,,"All in all, I would definitely come here again. I appreciate brunch menus that truly enhance basic breakfast items. Round of Applause Baby Barnaby's. "
,,,,,9/10 would recommend
,,,,,peace bye-bye.
,,,,,ALL THE CARBS!!!
,,,,,Don't bring your friends on a diet.  Do bring your friends who will go all in on ordering everything off the menu.  First..bring an umbrella. The outside waiting area is small and you may need to stand in the sun. We went on a Sunday and waited 1 hr for the table. But we also had a pet so that meant we had to wait for the few outdoor options. Despite the wait...omg...SO WORTH IT!!!
,,,,,"The migas, the pancakes, the bacon...all of it. Divine...french toast.  To die for."
,,,,,Best breakfast and brunch in Houston. The service is always great. Friendliest people in montrose. Be ready to come early or wait in a very long line. Usually loves pretty quickly though and it's always worth it. Love this place.
,,,,,Food was so good! I don't think I have ever had better breakfast potatoes!! The perfect amount of crisp on the outside. Service was also very friendly and efficient! Will definitely be coming back. 
,,,,,"We also appreciated that they kept the tables distanced in according with COVID-19 pre-cautions, everyone's mask was all the way on, and they had us wait outside till our table was ready. This made us feel so comfortable and appreciated the extra effort!!"
,,,,,We waited over an hour outside in the hot sun for a table and never got sat.  There were two tables completely done with their meals chatting while a lot of people were waiting in the hot sun to be sat outside. With COVID many restaurants are putting time limits on how long a table because there is limited real estate outside. This restaurant chooses not to do that...so disappointing. We weren't the only table to decide to leave. Again very disappointing.
,,,,,A cozy brunch place in a small neighborhood. Parking is on the streets. This place is always crowded because of how popular it is. We already expected a wait when we came in and it was a doable wait. Tables are usually available according to the number of people you have. Just sign your name on the list and wait on the bench outside.The inside is really small but they have a few additional tables outside. 
,,,,,"Red velvet pancake: Not too sweet, the texture of the pancake was soft. We ordered this because the waitress had said this was one of their items and it wasn't on the menu yet. The pancake itself could feed 3 people. The cream on the pancake made it too sweet to be eaten with. You can get it with banana slices on top. "
,,,,,Buttermilk waffle: The waffle also had a good texture. It had plenty of fresh berries and bananas on top. Good portion and could probably feed 2 people. It also tasted great with the syrup on top. 
,,,,,"Bob's healthy platter: 6 egg whites with a salsa dip. Also comes with a bowl of fruits, sausages, and 2 toasts. The egg whites goes well with the salsa. I like that their fruits are served fresh. "
,,,,,"Green eggs platter: My favorite out of the 4. A popular item on the menu. It also comes with tater tots, sausages, and 2 toasts. The green eggs were the best because of the way it was cooked with the spinach. The tater tots were also super crunchy and plentiful. I didn't have room in my tummy for the toasts after all the food. "
,,,,,"Services were mediocre. My friend said there was a stain on her cup so we asked for a new one. The cup never came even after we asked the waitress a second time. We also asked another waiter to take a picture of all of us since it was my friend's birthday. He said he would come back but he never did. We overlooked the service because we could tell how busy the place was. Overall, everything went well and the food was delicious."
,,,,,"Wow, baby Barnaby's certainly lived up to it hype! I went for Sunday Brunch at 11am - like all Sunday brunches there was a bit of a wait but it went pretty fast, especially seeing how many other people were there. So if you see a line, definitely don't let that deter you!!"
,,,,,Ordered coffee (which is bottomless) and fresh juice- they offer both fresh grapefruit and orange juice. Highly recommend. 
,,,,,"Based on all recs, I got the green eggs- I have to say, if you're a first timer like me, that is DEFINITELY the move. They above and beyond exceeded my expectations - a lot of flavor paired well with the chicken apple sausage. "
,,,,,Will definitely be coming back to explore the menu more!
,,,,,"Extensive and creative menu available.  We went boring and got the regular breakfast, with great grits, and everything was awesome."
,,,,,We arrived a bit before 8:00 a.m. and were joyfully greeted when they opened their doors.  By the time we left there were people waiting in line.
,,,,,The service was great.
,,,,,The atmosphere is small dinerish with a twist.  The twist being that it is in the middle of Houston.
,,,,,This may be a 5 star breakfast place but I need to be wowed!
,,,,,Love this place for breakfast! The green eggs are an awesome high protein meal. Very very tasty!
,,,,,"Food is great. Recommend to their management that they get a sign directing people to sign in. The clipboard to reserve a space is not easy to find and people constantly walk through the eating area, confused as to where they need to go. Staff ends up spending time directing people and being interrupted while doing their work."

,,,,,The strawberry Lemonade is addictive. I can't get enough. The food is delicious and also helps....to balance the addiction. haha
,,,,,I came here with high hopes but was sadly disappointed. Server was very friendly but the food is nothing worth raving about. 
,,,,,Ordered:
,,,,,"Corn beef hash: the meat was dry, the bread that accompanies the dish tasted like cardboard, the only thing that was solid was the over easy egg on top"
,,,,,& the Apple wood sausage was way to sweet
,,,,,Love this place which I had tried barnab's in downtown and museum district even though this is not well decorated like the others.
,,,,,Always order the tuna burger when I was there. That was my favorite.
,,,,,Good basic breakfast food. The Green eggs (I think it was named) with spinach and artichoke was tasty minus the cup of cheese thrown in 
,,,,,Chicken apple sausage is pretty good too
,,,,,Extra star for super friendly staff
,,,,,Great breakfast and service.  Consistent waitstaff always provides good service and Annie's burrito is my favorite.
,,,,,"Baby Barnaby's offers a great balance of good food and a unique ambiance. A lot of this restaurant's treasure lies in the experience - located in the middle of Montrose, being the perfect amount of ""run-down"", and a friendly amount of glee from the staff - making my visit to this spot more than worth it."
,,,,,"Parking is pretty limited to street parking, but there are some back roads behind the restaurant which worked for us. My friend and I definitely chose the worst time to come - 11 am on a Sunday, and our wait was ~40 minutes which was pretty unfortunate. There is a bit of seating, both covered and uncovered, for patrons to wait for tables to be free."
,,,,,"The restaurant itself is a little run down, but I think that adds to the ambiance of this little spot. We were seated inside (although there is nice covered, outside seating) where our waitress was more than happy to help us."
,,,,,"After being convinced the orange juice was out of this world by other Yelpers and seeing the orange juice be pressed by a constantly running machine inside the restaurant, I had to try it. It definitely exceeded my expectations for orange juice, but I don't know if I would pay $3 for a cup of orange juice ever again."
,,,,,"I opted for the breakfast plate which most definitely satisfied my brunch cravings. I was pretty amazed by the bacon, which had little grease and was the perfect amount of crispy. The grits were a little more bland than I would've liked, but besides that I was very satisfied with my meal."
,,,,,Barnaby's offers a pretty unique dining experience and is definitely worth a try. Would absolutely recommend to someone looking for a quaint spot to have brunch!
,,,,,"I had such a good time with the family today. The food was excellent and the service was warm and welcoming. I had the French toast and bacon, my partner in crime had a steak and the kids had waffles and pancakes stuffed with blueberries. I felt comfortable and was checked on the entire time I was there. I  will definitely be going back!"
,,,,,"This is the cute, smaller more home-y version of Barnaby's. It can get quite popular on the weekends, but the turnover seems to be pretty quick. There's outside and indoor seating, and it has a very casual weekend brunch feel to it. The service is super friendly as well!"
,,,,,"Green Eggs & Ham: I got this because it seemed to be a staple here and it was a great choice! The eggs are creamy and scrambled with spinach and artichoke and other greens, but it tastes delicious! It pairs pretty well with the toasted bread that you're given if you spread the egg on top. The potatoes are just the right size and amount of crunchy. The sausage was pretty flavorful, but overall I'm not a huge fan of sausage so I can't judge it well. "
,,,,,"Pancake: I don't remember which flavor we got, but I think that the pancakes here are too dry and crumbly. I like my pancakes with a little more moisture and slightly denser, but the pancakes here falls apart and because of that, I think the flavor isn't as strong either. You definitely need to slather on the maple syrup. "
,,,,,"Overall, this place is cute and I would definitely come back to try their other dishes! Probs a nah on the pancakes for me next time though."
,,,,,Best hole in the wall breakfast ever. French toast is top notch and servers are friendly. Only drawback is limited seating and it's mostly outside. Otherwise 10/10 recommend if you're looking for brunch on Sunday.
,,,,,"Scotty, Scotty, and Scotty! He makes this place home to MANY!! Baby Barnabys is ALL ROUND GREAT FOOD!!! They have managed to keep quality their utmost priority while serving their now famous warm service. I'll come here when I'm 90!"
,,,,,602 Fairview St
,,,,,"Houston, TX 77006"
,,,,,"Food is delectable!! Between the three of us, we enjoyed everything!! Migas, Lox, pancakes, oh my!!!"
,,,,,"If you like brunch, hit up Baby Barnabys! They make fresh orange juice and the coffee is fresh and hot! "
,,,,,"If you have to wait, coffee is there for you! Pet friendly!"
,,,,,"Incredibly rude staff. Upon arriving, there was no host in sight so my pregnant wife attempted to go into the restaurant to check-in. But a male waiter outside shouted to stop her and asked DID YOU SIGN THE CLIPBOARD, as if he was expecting us, as first time visitors, to know where it was. He didn't even instruct us to the location of the clipboard. We were initially excited to take our pup here, but was shocked by the rudeness. Needless to say, we left right away. Glad to be taking our patronage to somewhere else. To the ownership/management - please train your staff on hospitality."
,,,,,This is a popular spot with a long wait time (at least on the weekend) but the chicken and waffles made it totally worth the wait. The staff were friendly and the service was pretty quick.
,,,,,Tip: Order the orange juice! I have honestly never tasted fresh orange juice that sweet. It was a little unreal but absolutely delightful. It reminded me of the oranges I had growing up - the perfect amount of sweetness! 
,,,,,I definitely recommend brunching here!
,,,,,I ordered this Baby Barnaby's as a delivery for the first time ever trying them. I was very pleased to see how neatly everything was packaged and the portions were perfect. I will be ordering from here again. I ordered the club house sandwich and a house salad. 10/10 recommend
,,,,,"Nice breakfast place, must get the green eggs... delicious. The wait is long but worth it. This isn't your classic southern breakfast but it is a nice classy breakfast place, a lot like a breakfast place you'd find in Los Angeles. Service was great, fresh ingredients and coffee. Friendly servers, nice atmosphere."
,,,,,"We walked in for the first time and walked up to the desk. We were rudely told ""sign in on the list"". There was no hostess or podium and the table had no list. We were rather rudely told ""Check in and sign in on the list"". A couple customers seated pointed to a clip board on a post, but in truth the server should have walked over to us and taken the list down as we clearly didn't see it or a hostess to take our names on the list. "
,,,,,We walked out and will doubtfully be back. Eat at La Mexicana down Fairview if you want a great service and the best breakfast tacos in town. It's just down the street.
,,,,,"Worth the wait! Social distancing on the patio - we chose to wait for that option. Staff was polite, wore masks, and did an excellent job with the challenges they are facing. Best waffles! Make sure to ask for the fruit on top :)"
,,,,,Must try the potatoes and chicken sausage!!!!
,,,,,I have been to baby barnaby many times but recently had the 
,,,,," Pink and white scramble (ham chunks & white cheddar , scrambled with 3 eggs, served with potatoes and wheat toast) The ham scrambled eggs was a little wet. Dont know if that's how it's supposed to be. The cheddar was incorporated well and gave a cheese pull. I love love their potatoes, which are actually little potato cubes. Delicious every time."
,,,,,I do enjoy their freshly squeezed orange juice. The green eggs are a great dish as well. Pancakes are HUGE. 
,,,,,The seating here is limited and super super busy on the weekends. They have outdoor seating and are dog friendly! 
,,,,,They dont have a parking lot but there's plenty of neighborhood street parking.
,,,,,"Super tasty! Randomly picked this place for Saturday breakfast and was pleasantly surprised. I was hungry and got French toast & the pink and white scramble. I only ate the scramble while I was in the restaurant. It was regular tasting but food! Buttttt those potatoes....fire. Sooo tasty! So brown. So good. I also got the fresh squeezed OJ. It was okay, probably won't be getting that again. The French toast smelled heavenly. "
,,,,,"The restaurant is a bit small so it probably wouldn't be a good idea for a large party of people unless you called ahead (if they do that). When we walked in, I was confused as to how to get a table. Do we seat ourselves, talk to someone, which door do we enter through? There was actually a clipboard that you're supposed to sign in on and then your name will be called. I don't think that's the best idea because not only did we do it, but countless amounts of people walked in to only be told they had to go back outside to sign in on the clipboard. Maybe that's not an everyday thing? If it is, signage needs to go up at the very front. If theres already signage, it needs to be more attention grabbing. "
,,,,,Definitely will be coming back!
,,,,,As always the food is amazing. Smaller location so naturally the wait is longer and the quarters are closer. But it's charming. Classic. Love this little addition to the legacy b

,,,,,"Houston, TX 77006"
,,,,,"So glad we took a chance on this place while in Houston!! We had the lemon ricotta pancake and the green eggs. Everything was fresh, delicious and the vibe was awesome. Our waiter was also really funny and friendly! We'll be back!"
,,,,,We went on a quiet Saturday morning during the COVID pandemic. I got the breakfast sampler and substituted the eggs for fresh fruit (you can sub for anything except meat) and my husband got the breakfast tacos with flour tortillas and added spinach and onions to the eggs. 
,,,,,"The staff was extremely accommodating and friendly. They were precise, clean and cautious. We sat outside, with enough space between us and the surrounding tables. The food arrived so quickly. Everything tasted fresh and delicious. One of the best decisions of our trip... quick and clean service, fresh and delicious food at an amazing price. Thank you!!! Will definitely return in the future."
,,,,,Food was great! There was a bit of a line but the food was worth the wait. The chicken apple sausage is definitely the star of the dish.
,,,,,Super friendly staff and food is amazing! Good portions and delicious. The restaurant was pretty packed though
,,,,,"I like to eat the food at this franchise, I have been going to this particular barnaby's for a years now and let me just say DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION!! DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION. Unless you want the rudest service of your life. The Two guys with the orange hair are the RUDESTTTTT SERVERS ON THE PLANET. I absolutely cannot stand terrible service. Every time I come here they are so rude and act like they don't have time for you, they barely come to your table, and walk away before you finish ordering half the time. I cannot tell you how many times I was in the middle of changing a side, or ordering an extra drink, and I was walked away on in the middle of speaking. My boyfriend eventually decided that we wouldn't go here anymore in January 2021, today I decided to give it another try since were so close. The taller, bigger guy with the orange hair approached our table asked us about our drinks, I said I'm ready to order and he WALKED AWAY FROM MY TABLE, my boyfriend and I both raised our voices a bit to let him know we were ready to order AND HE STILL WALKED AWAY. I am sick and tired of the service at this place. I'm not one to write reviews, but these guys suck and give the worst service and are super super rude. DONT EAT AT THIS LOCATION. Go somewhere where the people don't hate their job."
,,,,,"Food was bombbbb my eggs, and bacon were perfect!!! Grits were a little bland not gonna lie. I took some of my friends potatoes and they were sooo good! Definitely will be back!!! It was rainy but loved the outdoor seating"
,,,,,"I had no complaints on food! Fair prices, full-portions (actually ...gigantic portions for pancake), and tasty!"
,,,,,Red Velvet Pancake (3.5/5) 
,,,,,"Don't get me wrong when I say it's 3.5 out of 5. It was still pretty good, but it's not something that satisfies my sweet cravings like the pancakes at snooze does. But I would actually order it again since I felt like I was eating actual breakfast instead of eating some sort of dessert."
,,,,,The Green Eggs (4/5)
,,,,,They're the best breakfast eggs I've had but they're still just eggs. Do you know what I mean? I'm kind of craving it as I'm writing this though. They were pretty good.
,,,,,"If you don't want to feel claustrophobic, go on a less hotter day and sit outside. The inside is even tinier than it looks from the outside and feels really hectic and cramped."
,,,,,"Cute and cozy brunch place! Although it was very busy when we went, we were seated fairly quickly. "
,,,,,Service was friendly. Our waitress was patient in letting us decide what to order.
,,,,,"I had the French Toast with a side of Apple Sausage. The French toast was light and fluffy, but pretty normal. The sausage was very fragrant and tasty."
,,,,,"My friend had the Red Velvet Pancakes. She said they were good, but a little too sweet."
,,,,,602 Fairview St
,,,,,"Overall, the food is good and has decent portions, but nothing to be blown away by."
,,,,,"The rush is real. You have to sign in on a yelllow legal pad sheet. Waiting is awkward. One guy requesting needs. Very tightly fitted. If they make their round, it will be awhile before they come  back to  you. Not an impressive situation. Not even Mel and FLo. Can not say that I would recommend to other. Attention not extended well. If we  hadn't have waited, would personally leave. We have not  even order but have  been  Seating for over 15 minutes. Well the food was outstanding and the service picked up."
,,,,,Solid breakfast place! I came here on a Sunday morning for breakfast. Theres a place for you to put your name in a pad since there will likely be a line. We waited about 20-30 minutes for a table inside for 2. 
,,,,,"I ordered the red velvet pancakes and my bf ordered the green eggs. Personally, I wasnt a big fan of the green eggs but it's one of their signatures so I would say it's worth a try. The red velvet pancakes came with a cream cheese frosting and was yummy. "
,,,,,"The service here was fast, whether it was getting the food out, getting our orders, or the check. The waiters here were friendly and accommodating. "
,,,,,Definitely recommend trying this place!
,,,,,This cafe had a waiting list. But the excellent service & amazing food was worth the wait
,,,,,"Houston, TX 77006"
,,,,,"Really great food! I enjoyed it. There was a wait, but it wasn't too bad. Those biscuits are the truth!"
,,,,,The breakfast here is phenomenal. My friends went back the very next day. In comparison to the wait at most breakfast places in the same area you can't beat it. I was afraid it was because the food was somehow inferior but that's definitely not the case. The staff make you feel at home and I didn't try one thing I didn't like. Because I definitely ate off my husbands plate as well.
,,,,,"Update: I still love this place, but the most recent time I went I was turned off by the service (so I had to downgrade my review to 4 stars). I remember when I first came, they had the complimentary coffee set out while people waited and never got charged. However, this time - the server charged me and stated that ""there is a sign"" (which I did not see) and started arguing with me. I decided to apologize when he came back and all he said was ""the sign wasn't there today."" He didn't apologize for arguing with me earlier and had no intention of informing me I wasn't in the wrong after making a scene."
,,,,,Going to preface this by saying this is hands down my #1 brunch spot in Houston. Nothing ever lives up to it. 
,,,,,"It's a restaurant in a cute little house, so it has a very warm feeling. I like the California vibe inside with all of the points of interests up on the wall. There is also seating in the patio, which is nice when it isn't too hot outside. They usually have complimentary coffee outside, and this is great on days when there is a wait (usually around 30 minutes max). It is definitely worth the wait though. They are dog friendly too."
,,,,,"My favorite dish and usually the thing I come here for is the green eggs. They are so creamy and fluffy and delicious. Their potatoes are well seasoned and the quantity is abundant. And it can be vegetarian friendly with a veggie sausage or you can even get a side of black beans. Their orange juice is always fresh and refreshing in the morning. I've tried their seasonal pancakes before, and they are always fluffy, not super sweet, and huge. "
,,,,,Just thinking about the green eggs right now during this review makes me want them so bad! This place never lets you down.
,,,,,"Oh my goodness...we happened upon this place by accident. It was pouring raining, and it had a nice convenient parking lot right next door. As we entered drenched, we were greeted by Scott, a ray of hysterical sunshine. The food was outstanding. We had the waffle, bacon, and breakfast burrito with potatoes. Everything was spot on. Scott truly made our dining experience fun. I laughed almost the entire meal. Five stars all the way. Thank you for a delicious breakfast and a great start to our day. We will definitely be back on our next trip to Houston."
,,,,,If you're in the Montrose area this little breakfast spot is amazing!!! From the ham steak and eggs which is delicious or the pork chop and eggs with potatoes and wheat toast  everything on the menu is fresh and extremely good. Don't pass up the freshly squeezed Grapefruit Juice it's so good. All the meats are juicy & not dry . The eggs aren't over cooked & everyone in the environment is normally cool people. The service is always great and I've never had a bad experience here!
,,,,,"LVE this place for breakfast! From the endless pots of coffee to the amazing eats, definitely a must when in Montrose. Scott is such a pleasure - attentive and witty with a touch of sarcasm. Just how a NYer likes it! Highly recommend the migos and fruit pancakes. DELISH!!"
,,,,,"It feels silly to order an egg salad sandwich out in public, but theirs is dreamy!  Complete with crispy bacon this is a solid ""always order"" from me."
,,,,,So I found this place when I googled breakfast near me and it is amazing. My mom ordered the ham steak and eggs which was delicious with sliced tomatoes and avocado. I ordered the pork chop and eggs with potatoes and wheat toast. It was scrumptious. It was juicy & not dry . The eggs were not over cooked & everyone in the environment looked as if they were enjoying their food.
,,,,,"This is the original Barnaby's Cafe, which is also why it is the smallest. Wait times here get hectic for brunch-- whether it is for indoor or outdoor seating. Even with the large fans, they do not stand a chance against the Houston heat. My favorites are the Migas and the Huevos Rancheros. Their OJ is freshly squeezed and comes in a small glass. "
,,,,,"They DO follow the paws on patio rule, my pups love it here!"
,,,,,Highly recommended! I loved the eggs and bacon ...
,,,,,"Cozy and friendly staff, very good service"

,,,,,"Houston, TX 77006"
,,,,,"Came here while visiting town heard that it was a really good place to try. The reason I rated this place three stars was due to the service before eve entering the establishment we waiting a hour and 15 minutes before evening getting to sit down. The space is very limited inside, they have outside sitting but it was so hot. Our group wouldn't have even been able to enjoy our food . They make you signup on piece paper thats posted on a clipboard and you wait for them to call your name. The longest wait I think I've ever waited for. The food was really great itself I had no complaints about the food our server made sure to try and accommodate us for the long wait after being outside the whole time which was much appreciated by our group. "
,,,,,Overall really good place itself to go and eat at just make sure that you get there early or you will be waiting for a while especially if your party size is larger then three people.
,,,,,Went here in January to see  about their keto options. 
,,,,,Servers were catty and didn't know what was in their soup. When I asked for lettuce wrap they gave me this. And charged extra lol.
,,,,,"Gotta give credit, where credit is due. These guys killed it for breakfast, my coworker and I left very full and very satisfied. You could tell they take great pride in all the food they make, and I look forward to visiting again next time I am in Houston."
,,,,,"Decor-kinda funky looking from the outside, but clean and neatly organized. Small dining, but cozy. Bathrooms are a bit eccentric, I guess it's what you'd expect from this place. "
,,,,,"Service-good service, waitress knew the menu and explained things well. "
,,,,,"Food-Breakfast rocked! I had the Migas con Huevo and it was amazing! Large portion and so tasty, I'm so surprised it was that awesome!!! These folks do breakfast right and I will be back soon."
,,,,,"Yes, yes, yes.  I love me Barnaby's.   Come early since they get busy.  Small outdoor patio space.  Free coffee while you wait.  Friendly staff.  I personally love the small dining space - retains the hole-in-the-wall feel even when their restaurant brand has gained full local notoriety."
,,,,,"My red velvet pancake was burnt, barely edible and super dry!  I'm disappointed because the food is normally ok."
,,,,,"We found street parking easily on a Saturday morning. For a party of 3, we waited about 15-20 mins before being seated at the outside patio. "
,,,,,We shared between us:
,,,,,"- Green Eggs: scrambled eggs with spinach, artichoke hearts and melty jack cheese. The eggs were well seasoned and cooked to a fluffy texture. The chicken apple sausage and potatoes that came with the dish were delicious as well."
,,,,,"- Banana Walnut Pancake: this pancake was a bit crumbly and less fluffy than expected. The banana flavor was only noticeable if you get banana chunks in your bite, otherwise the flavor was plain and texture was on the dry side. "
,,,,,"- Fruit Bowl: came with 2 strawberries, melon balls, blueberries, thin slices of orange with peel, and tiny chunks of pineapple. The quality and freshness of the fruit were not that great. It felt like this has been sitting for a while since the fruits on the bottom were soaked in water."
,,,,,"Service could've been more attentive. Our food took a while to come, and people that came after even got their food before us. Overall cleanliness is also a concern as the ice for the iced water was stored in a sink uncovered next to a sanitizing bucket."
,,,,,Went for breakfast on Fri around 10:30 am.  It was wait. But once we got seated it was fast service and food was great. Breakfast taco was one of the best I have had. Definitely coming back
,,,,,Excellent meal worth the wait 
,,,,,Breakfast was awesome 
,,,,,My friend got heuvos rancheros with corn tortillas 
,,,,,It tasted great
,,,,,I got the breakfast plate with eggs scrambled and sausage and grits and whole wheat toast
,,,,,It tasted great would highly recommend
,,,,,Delicious food and great service. perfectly cooked steak and eggs! Green eggs and chicken apple sausage...delicious! Fresh OJ so good!
,,,,,"Great food, service is very friendly! My table ordered the French toast, waffle and breakfast tacos. I got to try all of them and highly recommend the all the options but especially the French toast! Cool place!"

,,,,,I don't know what it is but gays sue know how to cook!
,,,,,Not only here i know other restaurants to .
,,,,,So what's different here well the place is in a old
,,,,,Montrose house so it kind of gives you at home vide and for me I mostly eat Thai food given I am Thai so this is the only American gay establishment I know if I'm sure there are many others.
,,,,,I really love the crispy potatoes green eggs and the steak it's pretty good as well.
,,,,,PS the staff is super friendly.
,,,,,"Best Breakfast food, Best Service and the best OJ in town!!! Thanks for showing Snooze how to loose....LOL"
,,,,,"Definitely come here over an ihop or Dennys any day. Vibey, really good price points. But there's a bit of a wait sometimes. Very friendly staff, very retro vibes. I felt like I was in a back to the future movie."
,,,,,I met a friend here for lunch and we had a great time! It's a cute little cafe that has a lot of great different options. We both ordered the house salad with chicken and it was really good. I wish I ordered it in their smaller size since I only ate about half of it. Definitely a larger portion than I thought! We also got the $1 brownies at the end which was the perfect bite size amount to end our meal. Definitely recommend this place and would love to come back in the future!
,,,,,I enjoyed coming here. This place can get packed easily so the best time to go is bright and early in the morning. We got a corner booth seat and I absolutely enjoyed it. It was very quiet and cozy. The food was great. I had the banana walnut pancake! Great price for the amount of food you get!
,,,,,Great ambiance and atmosphere! Lovely welcoming staff willing to answer any questions! Food was really authentic and homemade! Biscuits and steak was the bomb as well as the fluffy waffles. Great grapefruit juice and outside seating for dogs.
,,,,,"Cons: Fantastic breakfast spot, I had the waffles, they are fluffy and delicious! They were so large I had half for breakfast the next day. The biscuit and the potatoes were also great. Coffee was very good. "
,,,,,"Cons: it is very popular so there is a long wait, but it is totally worth it. Service was lacking because they were so busy, so we had keep calling the waiter back for missing parts of our orders, but at least they helped with a smile."
,,,,,Baby Barnabys is a Montrose staple. The portions are huge and the food is always delicious. I come here at least 1 a month for breakfast. 
,,,,,"I'm writing this review because Scott is hands down the best server around. Scott expertly runs the joint and I always know I am in the best hands when he is my server. His warm, friendly demeanor is unmatched. Everyone who walks through the door is greeted by name. When things get busy, Scott is never flustered. Calm, personable and ""with-it"" Scott manages Baby Barnabys with the expertise of a ship captain. "
,,,,,"Twice now I've been the very first customer when they open and to say that having Scott be my first interaction of the day makes my whole mood/outlook on the day positive and hopeful is a vast understatement. Starbucks used to teach this in their trainings ""baristas may be the first people customers talk to in the morning...."". And while they have tapped into something important and true, Scott nails this. He truly kicks people's days off on the right foot. It's like having a good friend serve you who understands that, while friends, he is also still the server. That's a hard line to toe. But he always maintains the perfect balance. "
,,,,,I just can't say enough about this first rate service. It's people like Scott that will always keep me coming back!
,,,,,"Great food, reasonable price and good for groups but only for about 6 or less. Be prepared to wait a while because of its popularity and the small space. It usually differs from 25-45 depending on the day. The staff was also sweet and attentive. Definitely recommend to try at least one time, though there is a small menu."
,,,,,"I've returned multiple times now, I find myself craving the food! :)"

,,,,,"Stopped in on a weekday for a solo breakfast. So glad I went early because this location is small and shortly after my arrival, around 9:30am, several people came through the door. All were directed to sign in on the clipboard until seats became available. It's so small, I wouldn't recommend it for parties larger than 4 plus there also isn't a ton of parking. The upside to all of this quaintness is the home-like feeling it yields. The staff knew their customers which added a certain charm to a well-known chain."
,,,,,Onto the food: the breakfast is delish. I thought I was just getting a simple order of pancakes with chicken sausage and eggs but it was no ordinary flapjack. It was fluffy and huge! Definitely couldn't eat it all but it was yummy. Also loved that they fresh squeezed juice to order...nice touch. Barnaby's seems to be scattered about the city but this was one of my favorite experiences.

,,,,,"I Love this small quaint breakfast cafe. It was a cold wait this time due to the weather but the warmth and yumminess of the food was worth the wait. I ordered the French toast with bacon and potatoes, sooo good! Every time I come here the service is fantastic and the food is hot and fresh! The bacon has thee best smoked flavor ever!!!! If you come by here, don't leave without ordering a side of bacon, you'll thank me later."
,,,,,"I went here over the weekend because my friends and I wanted to relive our college days. Baby Barnaby's is located in the heart of Montrose, and has the most delicious brunch you will EVERRRRRR have!!!! My go to are always the Green Eggs which are AMAZING!! It's basically spinach and artichoke hearts mixed with pepper jack cheese in your eggs. It comes with potatoes and chicken sausage which are so good as well. The portions here are huge, and price is so reasonable. Not like all of these bougie/overpriced Houston brunch spots. "
,,,,,"The place is pretty small on the inside. So a wait around noon for a party or 4 took about 30 minutes. Time went by fast though. They have some outdoor seating as well, but we didn't want to sweat in the Houston heat.  the service is always great, and the employees are always so sweet and fast!"
,,,,,Truly one of my favorite places for breakfast! The corn beef hash has never disappointed. This place is typically packed on a Saturday or Sunday mid-morning so if you're super hungry be prepared to wait! There isn't a hostess or stand to check-in but a sign-in sheet on a clipboard. Next up will have their name called and that's when you'll know your table is ready. There's a couple of benches for those who are waiting but space is tight. 
,,,,,Seating inside and outside of the restaurant is pretty narrow so leave your strollers and large purses at home. Outside is pet-friendly but overall you might be squeezing by or sitting pretty close to the next table. I usually don't go with more than one other person to ensure that we are seated comfortably. If you're up early definitely worth checking out!
,,,,,"The food is delicious and the service is even better. The hospitality here was very welcoming. You can hear the staff call the customers by their names which is a nice touch.  Very local vibe. Also they're playing 80s music inside which is the best. Great menu selection, will definitely be returning during our Houston stay."
,,,,,Been multiple times and never fails in satisfying me. Usually I order the grilled pork chop plate.
,,,,,"Service was great. Food was good except my pancake was burnt. Took my dog with me and I love how pet friendly this place is! I'd go back, but I wouldn't get the pancake again."
,,,,,"First stop after moving to Houston and this place was sure a great start! Fresh and delicious food, topped with great service. We had the Blueberry Pancake, Lox Platter and a Fruit Bowl. My toddler was very happy and so were we! Thank you Barnaby's we'll be back soon."
,,,,,We had breakfast at Baby Barbaby's.  I had the scrambled egg/spinach dish.  The eggs were cooked perfectly... still moist.   Definitely tasted great!!!
,,,,,Scott will remember your name and order.  You will get a healthy or decadent breakfast and it will always taste delicious. You will be in the heart of Montrose and that is a sweet place to be.
,,,,,"What can you say about this iconic eatery that hasn't already been said? Utter perfection. The staff is usually on top of their game in this tiny venue, and the food is delicious and dependable. All the Barnaby's locations are top notch. I also think the owner should write a book about training staff...he hires the sweetest and most capable service staff in town. I'm a fan."

,,,,,Loved the breakfast! Come early as the actual restaurant is relatively small. Definitely worth the wait for brunch though.
,,,,,I can't say enough positive things about Barnabys! This is the origin of casual breakfast/lunch/dinner/comfort food.
,,,,,"Great service, huge portions, sand did NSFW with love... Overall, this shit!"
,,,,,"The potatoes were very good.  The pancake was solid and the chicken apple sausage was pretty good.  I went for the french toast I've heard rave about but they haven't had that in inventory for a while and will be out of stock indefinitely, apparently.  All in all it was pretty good with good service, so I'd return and recommend."
,,,,,"There are some places where the food is SO good you HAVE to leave a review while still in the location. THIS is one of those places!! As everyone states the service was ALMOST as good as the food!!! I got French toast sausage and eggs and everything was amazing everything tasted top notch!!! My fiancé got the waffle, eggs, and bacon and just the same! TOP NOTCH!! We will be returning customers for sure! Please give this place a try. ONLY negative was orange juice, it get peeled in the machine but you can tell the orange peel ""juice"" gets in there slightly, it's not terrible but if you're expecting like store orange juice you may be disappointed!!"
,,,,,Grits were bland and pancakes are a little thick but everything else was amazing. A little compact as far as seating but it's an ok spot.
,,,,,"Okay their sweet potato fries with ran h dressing are on point but it's the burgers and desserts that do it for me.  And baby B's does all these things plus some delish salads, and a number of entrees and appetizers that are equally tasty.  Have yet to have a rush I didn't eat all of, a great sign!!!"
,,,,,We loved this restaurant!
,,,,,Not only was the food great but I have to give a review on
,,,,,Scott.... HE IS AMAZING!!
,,,,,I thought he was the owner because he performed with so much care and gave us the feeling that we were in his home!!
,,,,,Such a wonderful host!!!
,,,,,Will definitely be back!!' 
,,,,,"Scott..,you are great!!!"
,,,,,"We are from Beaumont, and I live in Conroe, TX....originally from Louisiana.. so we know good service!!! WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE !!"
,,,,,"The food is great and the staff are wonderful, the only thing for me is that the food is a bit pricey - but that's something I can get past if the food is good enough like it is here."
,,,,,"We recently went to Baby Barnaby's for brunch on a Sunday. The first tip I can give is to account for a long wait time. It's a rustic style diner, which is fine if the food is great, but the rancheros and omelette we got was just below average. The service was sloppy as well as we had to wait for a long time to order our food and they forgot to bring an item as well. We were not impressed at all and won't go back."
,,,,,"A-MA-ZING!! We were on a staycation Downtown and decided to Google nearby breakfast spots. It was such a warm and welcoming place...wonderful staff and the food was delicious! I don't live nearby but I will DEFINITELY be back! Oh yeah...try the Green Eggs, you won't be disappointed"

,,,,,Good place to have a nice brunch with your family and friends! :)
,,,,,We stopped by here for the first time after hours of cycling in the park!
,,,,,It's a popular restaurant so we had to wait for 20 mins also but it's worth the wait!
,,,,,I got Miga and it was a good one!
,,,,,Will definitely stop by if we go around there! Come visit and enjoy the good food! Nice service is awaited for ya! Cheers
,,,,,Looking for a hearty and healthy brunch? This spot is JUST THAT! 
,,,,,"Green Eggs has two eggs scrambled with spinach, artichoke hearts, and Jack cheese.  When I first got the plate I thought the eggs looked soggy but they pair perfectly with the chicken apple sausage and crispy potatoes. I subbed my wheat toast for an English muffin and I loved it!"
,,,,,Wait time was ~20 minutes on New Years Day. You sign in on a clipboard and wait outside for your name to be called. 
,,,,,"Coffee and drinks were bleh. Come here for the food, not the drinks!"
,,,,,"I and my partner was coming from work this past Friday  and stopped into  a neighborhood bar, but after we had finished our drinks and decided to go this Baby Barnarby's. I did not realized that I was sleeping off, and this stupid and rude waiter started to shout at me and demanded that I wake up, I know that waiting does not make a enough money, but there are some people that  do work hard for a living, especially if your an Executive Chef and General Manager like myself. I would not patron this restaurant at all "
,,,,,This waiter could have handle  the matter differently. 
,,,,,He did not even offer me bread and coffee.
,,,,,This place is always a hit! The trick to getting a spot without a wait is to go around 9am on Sunday so that there isn't a crowd or a long line. I always get their green eggs and potatoes because to me they're like crack!!! It's so addicting and the portion is very big for the price you pay! Also the servers and super nice and sweet. This place is LGBTQ friendly and has the most eclectic art decors on the wall. Parking is a bit tricky since it's street parking but I find that the spots around Hopkins and Stanford are usually available and safe to park!
,,,,,"We were visiting Houston and we needed a nice, local feeling spot to try before we hit the road. This place DELIVERED! Such good food, we had wings and waffles and the wings were fantastic. The waffles were also delicious, but I really loved how charming the small area was. It had some outdoor seating and an intimate, cozy area that feels like a diner inside. The manager on that day was great, he made sure he checked on us frequently, was helpful and had some southern humor to match. Would recommend!"
,,,,,"Wonderful experience and FANTASTIC FOOD. Small location, but worth the wait. I am really happy that we made a switch from our usual breakfast spot. My hubby said the fresh squeezed OJ was "" worth the price of admission"". No cost of admission, but he'd have paid it because it is FRESH!! Take a moment to discover this great neighborhood gem.  The host is fab and knows everyone by name. That's the ambiance that will keep me coming back. When traveling to HOU this will be a stop!!"
,,,,,"Great breakfast - not fancy, but just what you want. I had the breakfast chorizo tacos and an English muffin. Staff is very friendly. Cool vibe :)"
,,,,,COVID RESPONSE: I am writing this review quiet late. I visited back when the capacity limits were still at 50%. 
,,,,,- They were not following capacity limits back when I visited (On a Sunday) 
,,,,,"-This place is quite small so if they were do do so, they would only be able to have 2-3 tables max. They did install some glass/plastic walls between booths and all servers wearing masks. "
,,,,,-If you are worried about COVID then I would 100% order to go. 
,,,,,Food:
,,,,,"Food was really really good. Honestly, this might be my favorite American breakfast place in Houston. I ordered the green eggs and it's so good. Not over greasy, huge portions. "
,,,,,Service:
,,,,,"Service was great, very busy but our waiter did not skip a beat."
,,,,,What a charming spot to grab a breakfast. This tiny building makes the best or everything. Green eggs are velvety and perfect with toast. 
,,,,,Adorable decor and friendly service. The fresh squeezed OJ is a must.
,,,,,"If only I took a photo but the food was too amazing by the time I realized I should have! Barnaby's has amazing service and delicious food! I loved the high energy of our server. We ordered the greens eggs, huevos rancheros and a side of French toast. The food was so good I decided to make my own green eggs. The orange juice was freshly squeezed and the best I've had."

,,,,,"If you follow me at all, you know I'm a sucker for Barnaby's breakfast. Breakfast is my favorite meal and they have my favorite dish. It's basically all I get at any of their locations. I'm not sure if this is their OG spot but  it's definitely their most reviewed.  This location looks like it was a house turned restaurant. Super tiny but lots of character. If you come on a weekend, prepare for a long wait and hard to find parking. The staff here has lots of personality and always makes you feel at home. "
,,,,,"Back to my favorite meal, since I first had it, I don't think I've ordered another breakfast at any of the Barnaby's locations. The dish I speak of is the Green Eggs!  This is breakfast perfection on a plate. The dish gets its name from you guessed it, green eggs. It's 2 eggs with artichokes and spinach with a touch of jack cheese. It's always nice and creamy oh so tasty. It comes with the best breakfast potatoes you will ever have and a slice of toast or biscuits. The serving sizes are huge and you will not leave hungry. I always order some of their fresh squeezed OJ to wash it down.  I've tried bites of some of their other stuff and it's always good as well, but I can't stay away from my favorite."
,,,,,"Baby Barnaby's (and the other Barnaby's restaurants) is a great brunch spot if you're looking for no fuss, classic brunch options. There can be a wait, especially if you come on the weekends, but if you have the time, it's a great place to grab a meal. I tried the chicken fried steak with scrambled eggs and potatoes and shared the apple pancake with my girlfriend. The chicken fried steak was nice and crispy on the outside with a juicy middle, and the scrambled eggs were soft and creamy. I do think the potatoes were probably fried or baked from a frozen batch as my college cafeteria had these exact potatoes (lol). The apple pancake was nice and fluffy and not too sweet. I would have appreciated more apple pieces, but it was a good treat. This location doesn't have much parking, so you'll most likely end up parking on the street and walking over."
,,,,,"I have been going to baby barnaby's for 15 years and still think their green eggs breakfast to be the most delicious and comforting brunch I have ever had. We usually arrive between noon to 1 pm, where it's about 30-40 min before we're seated. I completely expect this, so I don't mind the wait. We would walk around the neighborhood during this time, where we always come across several friendly stray cats. Service has been consistently excellent for us - granted we do our best to be polite and always tip well. We love that the owner and manager of the restaurant aren't afraid to get their hands dirty to help the staff clean tables, bring out dishes, etc. We will always be back. "
,,,,,Ps. The homemade OJ is also bomb.
,,,,,Love this place!! My fiancé and I enjoyed a great brunch here. We sat outside on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon and loved our meals. The fresh squeezed orange juice was a perfect addition to our yummy eggs!
,,,,,"So disappointing. I had hoped to finally try this place since I was in the area. Waited and waited to be seated, a worker came out to get payment and bring food for a to go order and never said a word to me - literally walked around me, went back in and never came back out. "
,,,,,"Oh well, guess I'll drive back to Torchy's Tacos. At least they welcome their guests waiting."
,,,,,I love baby barnabys! I always come here for their salad. I love the falafel on them. They have good appetizers They have cake selections for dessert too and the carrot cake is a must try! It's awesome that they are pet friendly so you can bring your furry friend with you.
,,,,,"First impressions are of a quaint, nice and peaceful location in the middle of a Houston suburb.  The wait is monitored by a simple sign-in system with a sheet where customers write their name, and are called once a table is ready.  This takes forever, and customers are left waiting outside on the sidewalk, as there's minimal seating in the designated waiting area.  Once inside, we were greeted by an outdated, not-so-clean restaurant.  It was very small and cramped, and the restroom was absolutely filthy.  The waitress was very nice and helpful, and provided great service.  Food came out of the kitchen at a reasonable pace, but the quality was so-so.  The eggs were fresh and delicious, but that's about where the compliments end.  The sausage was over cooked, there was no seasoning on anything, the potatoes were not washed before cooking, and I've had better waffles in hotel lobbies.  Barnaby's is an experience to be had by some, but not for me."
,,,,,"Green Eggs, no ham? I'm Sold"
,,,,,I ordered the Green Eggs Breakfast with an extra order of potatoes.
,,,,,"I dined with my 10 month old, she loves potatoes, so I assumed I would need more than what came with my meal (I was starving)"
,,,,,"A glass of water was poured as I placed my order, the pitcher was left on the table for easy refills. The water was tap."
,,,,,I also ordered a glass of fresh grapefruit juice. It was the perfect balance of sweet and sour.
,,,,,The green eggs were phenomenal; that blend of spinach and artichoke with the eggs and cheese was a great spin on scrambled eggs. 
,,,,,"The breakfast potatoes were fried perfectly, a nice crisp on the outside and a hot, soft inside."
,,,,,The hidden gem of this plate was the sausage. I bit into it forgetting it was an apple-chicken sausage. It was so savory and delicious. My daughter loved it too.
,,,,,The extra order of potatoes wasn't necessary but we definitely enjoyed them later!
,,,,,I will be returning to try more menu options and to have the Green Eggs breakfast again.
,,,,,First time visiting this delicious restaurant .
,,,,,It's a small restaurant but definitely giving comforting vibes on the inside. 
,,,,,I had the green eggs and chicken sausage meal however I substituted the toast and potatoes for French toast. The green eggs were so rich with flavor -- I feel the chef really made a well balanced of green vegetables to incorporate in the eggs. 
,,,,,The French toast and sausage was also good. They were prepared in a  way I have never had but was still delicious 
,,,,,"I also enjoyed that the restaurant has a parking lot in the back, not many breakfast spots in Houston have that."
,,,,,"We eat at Barnaby's frequently. Although we've actually never ate in, we always get takeout. Food is always well packed and usually pretty good. I can't remember having an experience there where I was like this was disappointing. I drive by them all the time and they always look like people are enjoying themselves, at least from the outside patios. I would definitely suggest giving this place a try"
